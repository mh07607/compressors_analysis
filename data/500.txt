← 20202022 →
The 2021 FC Edmonton season was the club's tenth competitive season as well as their third in the Canadian Premier League.


Overview[edit]
The 2021 season was very disappointing for FC Edmonton. Edmonton's average home attendance of 961 was by far the lowest in the league, and the team finished in 7th out of 8 teams. Additionally, the club shut down its academy. However, there were some bright spots, including young Canadian forward Easton Ongaro who became the league's all-time top goalscorer this season, and secured a transfer to Romania after the season ended.[1][2]

Current squad[edit]
As of July 6, 2021.

"Playaz Club" (1994)

"I'll Be Around" (1995)

"Ain't No Playa (Playaz Shit)" (1996)

"I'll Be Around" is the second single released from American rapper Rappin' 4-Tay's second album, Don't Fight the Feelin' (1994). The song both samples the music and retains the original chorus of the Spinners' song of the same name, though Rappin' 4-Tay replaced the song's original lyrics with his own. The Spinners were credited as featured artists, and songwriters Thom Bell and Phil Hurtt were both given writing credits.
The song became 4-Tay's second consecutive top-40 single in the United States, peaking at number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Hot Rap Singles chart, becoming his biggest hit on that chart. It also reached number one in New Zealand and number 30 on the UK Singles Chart. The single became the Spinners' last top-40 hit in both the US and UK, 34 years after their first, "That's What Girls Are Made For" (1961).

Patrick A. O'Donnell (21 August 1907 – 4 October 1970) was an Irish Fine Gael politician and Teachta Dála (TD) for over twenty years.[1]
He was born on 21 August 1907 in County Meath to James F. O'Donnell, a hotelier, of Burtonport, County Donegal, and Bridget O'Donnell (née McDonnell).[2] Raised in Burtonport, O'Donnell was educated at national schools in Meenmore and Meenamara, and at St Eunan's College in Letterkenny.[2]
He studied for a time at University College Dublin, and qualified as a solicitor in 1930, serving his apprenticeship with a firm in Ballybofey, County Donegal. He established his own practice in Dungloe, which became one of the largest and most successful in Ireland, with extensive business throughout counties Donegal, Sligo, and Leitrim.[2]
While Minister for Local Government, attended the St Eunan's College Golden Jubilee there in September 1956.[3] He was a member of Donegal County Council from 1959 to 1970.[2]
He was first elected to Dáil Éireann on 16 November 1949 for the Donegal West constituency, in a by-election caused by the death of Fianna Fáil TD Brian Brady. He was re-elected at the 1951 general election and retained his Dáil seat until his death in 1970.[4] O'Donnell was also a member of cabinet, serving as Minister for Local Government in the Second Inter-Party Government under Taoiseach John A. Costello. He was the first Donegal deputy ever to serve in cabinet.[2]

Unexplored is a series of two roguelike video games developed and published by Ludomotion. The first game, Unexplored, was released in 2017. The second game, Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer's Legacy, was released in 2022.


Gameplay[edit]
Unexplored games are roguelike action role-playing games.[1][2] The first game's objective is to reach the deepest floor of the dungeon and retrieve the Amulet of Yendor.[3] The second game's objective is to destroy the Staff of Yendor.[4] The second game features 3D graphics as opposed to the first game's top-down 2D graphics.[5][6]

Release[edit]
After six months of early access, Unexplored was released for Windows on February 22, 2017.[7] Linux and macOS versions were planned to be released in the first quarter of 2018,[8] but as of November 2019, Linux and macOS versions were still unreleased.[9] Three downloadable content (DLC) packs were released for the game.[10] A Nintendo Switch port was released on August 9, 2018, in Europe and North America.[11][12] PlayStation 4 port was released in North America and Europe in February 2019,[13] along with Xbox One port.[13] Switch and Xbox One ports were published by Digerati.[14]
Unexplored 2 was announced at E3 2019's PC Gaming Show.[15] A Fig crowdfunding campaign was launched at the same time.[15][16] The game was launched in early access on June 21, 2021,[17] followed by its full release in 2022 for Windows on May 27, for Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on June 3, and for PlayStation 4 on September 14.[18]

Both Unexplored games received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.[19][20][22]

Unexplored[edit]
Waypoint wrote: "Unexplored's procedurally generated levels are dense with meaning, memory, and connection in a way that most other RL's [roguelikes] aren't".[26] Rock Paper Shotgun also praised the procedural level design.[27] Nintendo Life said that unlike Unexplored's "overly simplistic" artstyle, the "unusual approach to balancing combat and map generation" is its most memorable element.[21] Nintendo World Report didn't like the game's combat and how the dungeon was procedurally generated.[3] PC Gamer wrote that the game's randomly generated worldbuilding was "quietly revolutionary".[28] PC Gamer nominated Unexplored for the best strategy game of 2017.[29] Waypoint included the game among its best games of 2017.[30] Dominic Tarason of Rock Paper Shotgun listed the game as one of the top three games of 2017, calling the procedural generation "a borderline-magical piece of code".[10]

Unexplored 2[edit]
CD-Action called Unexplored 2 ambitious and beautiful but criticized the story and lack of polish.[24] Eurogamer complimented the graphics and soundtrack but did not appreciate the procedurally generated story.[23] PC Gamer criticised the amount of bugs, calling the full release "too broken to interact with as intended".[4] Rock Paper Shotgun liked the game's barter and permadeath systems, and artstyle though disliked the story and camera system.[31]

Flashcards are an application of the testing effect. Here, flashcard software Anki is used to review a mathematical formula through active recall. First, only the question is displayed. Then the answer is displayed too, for verification.The testing effect (also known as retrieval practice, active recall, practice testing, or test-enhanced learning)[1][2][3] suggests long-term memory is increased when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory.[4] It is different from the more general practice effect, defined in the APA Dictionary of Psychology as "any change or improvement that results from practice or repetition of task items or activities."[5]
Cognitive psychologists are working with educators to look at how to take advantage of tests—not as an assessment tool, but as a teaching tool [6] since testing prior knowledge is more beneficial for learning when compared to only reading or passively studying material (even more so when the test is more challenging for memory).[7]

Before much experimental evidence had been collected, the utility of testing was already evident to some perceptive observers including Francis Bacon who discussed it as a learning strategy as early as 1620.[8] 
"Hence if you read a piece of text through twenty times, you will not learn it by heart so easily as if you read it ten times while attempting to recite it from time to time and consulting the text when your memory fails." 
Towards the end of the 17th Century, John Locke made a similar observation regarding the importance of repeated retrieval for retention in his 1689 book "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding". 
"But concerning the ideas themselves, it is easy to remark, that those that are oftenest refreshed (amongst which are those that are conveyed into the mind by more ways than one) by a frequent return of the objects or actions that produce them, fix themselves best in the memory, and remain clearest and longest there."[9] 
Towards the end of the 19th century, Harvard psychologist William James described the testing effect in the following section of his 1890 book "The Principles of Psychology" "A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition. I mean that in learning (by heart, for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again. If we recover the words in the former way, we shall probably know them the next time; if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book once more." [10]The first documented empirical studies on the testing effect were published in 1909 by Edwina E. Abbott [11][12] which was followed up by research into the transfer and retrieval of prior learning.[13][14] In his 1932 book Psychology of Study, C. A. Mace said: "On the matter of sheer repetitive drill there is another principle of the highest importance: Active repetition is very much more effective than passive repetition. ... there are two ways of introducing further repetitions. We may re-read this list: this is passive repetition. We may recall it to mind without reference to the text before forgetting has begun: this is active repetition. It has been found that when acts of reading and acts of recall alternate, i.e., when every reading is followed by an attempt to recall the items, the efficiency of learning and retention is enormously enhanced." [15] Studies in retrieval practice started in 1987 by John. L Richards, who published his findings in a newspaper in New York. [citation needed] Much of the confusion around early studies could have been due to constrained approaches not accounting for context.[16] In more recent research with contributions from Hal Pashler, Henry Roediger and many others, testing knowledge can produce better learning,[17][18][19] transfer,[20] and retrieval [21] results when compared to other forms of study [18] that often use recognition [22] like re-reading [23] or highlighting.[24]
Retrieval practice[edit]
In recent research, storage strength (how well an item is learned) and retrieval strength (how well an item can be retrieved)[25] have become separate measures for retrieval practice.[26] Retrieval strength (also known as recall accuracy) is typically higher for restudied words when tested immediately after practice, whereas tested words were higher as time moves on.[27] This suggests using tests is more beneficial for long-term memory and retrieval[28][29] which some authors believe is due to limited retrieval success during practice[26][27][30] supporting the idea that tests are learning opportunities.[31]
Functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests that retrieval practice strengthens subsequent retention of learning through a "dual action" affecting the anterior and posterior hippocampus regions of the brain.[32] This could support findings that individual differences in personality traits or with working memory capacity, don't seem to have any negative impacts of the testing effect,[33] with a greater impact for lower ability individuals.[34]
Despite some doubting knowledge transfer across a topic when testing[35] with some studies showing contradictory evidence[36] suggesting recognition was better than recall,[37] inferential thinking has been supported[38] and the transfer of learning is at its strongest with application of theory to practice, inference questions, medical education,[39] and problems involving medical diagnosis.[40] The transfer can occur across domains,[16] paradigms,[41] and help retention for material not on a final test.[42] Using retrieval practices also produces less forgetting than studying and restudying[43] while helping to identify misconceptions and errors[44][45][46] with effects lasting years.[47]

Repeated testing[edit]
Main article: Spaced repetition
Repeated testing have shown statistical significance[48] and results getting better than repeated studying[49][50] which could be due to testing creating multiple retrieval routes for memory,[51] allowing individuals to form lasting connections between items,[52] or blocking information together[53] which can help with memory retention[54] and schema recall.[55] Using spaced repetition has shown an increase on the testing effect[56][57] with a greater impact with a delay in testing,[58] but the delay could lead to forgetting[59] or retrieval-induced forgetting.
Delaying the test after a session can have a greater impact[60] so studying in the day should be tested in the evening with a delay, but studying in the evening should have an immediate test due the effect sleep has on memory.[61] Despite divided attention being thought to decrease the testing effect, if it is from a different medium it could enhance the effect.[36]
The rate of forgetting is not affected by the speed[62] or degree of learning[63] but by the type of practice involved.[60]

Test difficulty[edit]
Main article: desirable difficulty
According to the retrieval effort hypothesis, "difficult but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful retrievals" which supports the idea of finding a desirable difficulty within the retrieval practice considering our memory biases.[25] Learning a language was better when using unfamiliar words compared to familiar words, supporting higher difficulty resulting in greater learning.[64] The difficulty relates to the likelihood of forgetting[65] as the harder it is to remember, the more likely you are to remember and retain the information[66] supporting the notion that more effort is required for longer lasting retention[67] similar to the depth of processing at encoding.[68] Therefore, lack of effort from students studying could be a factor that reduces its efficiency.[49]
Increased difficulty shows decreased initial performance but increased performance on harder tests in the future, so retention and transfer suffer less when training is difficult.[53] Even unsuccessful retrieval can enhance learning,[69] as creating the thought helps with retention[70] due to the generation effect.[71][72] Like with processing time, it is the qualitative nature of the information that determines retention.[68]
Getting feedback helps with learning[73] but finding a desirable difficulty for the test combined with feedback[74] is more beneficial than studying or testing without feedback.[75][76] The Read, Recite, Review method[77] has been proposed as a method to combine retrieval practice with feedback.[78]

Test format[edit]
The test format doesn't seem to impact the results as it is the process of retrieval that aids the learning[79] but transfer-appropriate processing suggests that if the encoding of information is through a format similar to the retrieval format then the test results are likely to be higher, with a mismatch causing lower results.[80] However, when short-answer tests or essays are used [81][82] greater gains in results are seen when compared to multiple-choice test [83]
Cued recall can make retrieval easier[84] as it reduces the required retrieval strength from an individual which can help short term results,[85] but can hinder long term retrieval overtime due to reduced retrieval demand during practice.[86] Quicker learning can reduce the rate of forgetting for a short period of time, but the effect doesn't last as long as more effortful retrieval.[87] Cueing can be seen when encoding new information overlaps with prior knowledge making retrieval easier[88][89] or from a visual or auditory aid.
Prior knowledge seems to increase the impact of retrieval practice,[90] but should not be seen as a boundary condition as individuals with higher prior knowledge and individuals with lower prior knowledge both benefit.[91]  Pre-testing can be used to get greater results,[92][93] and the post-testing can be used to facilitate learning and memory of newly studied information, known as the forward testing effect.[94] Pre-test or practice test accuracy doesn't predict post test results as time affects forgetting [95]

Pre-testing effect[edit]
The pre-testing effect, also known as errorful generation or pre-questioning, is a related but distinct category where testing material before the material has been learned appears to lead to better subsequent learning performance than would have been the case without the pre-test, provided that feedback is given as to the correct answers once the pre-testing phase is completed or further study is undertaken. Pre-testing has been shown to aid learning in both laboratory. and classroom settings.[96] In terms of specific examples, pre-testing appears to be a beneficial strategy in language learning,[64][53] science classrooms generally,[97] and specifically with lower ability learners in Chemistry.[98] Pre-testing also seems to be a good way of introducing a lecture series and reduces mind-wandering during lectures.[99] However, while some studies show that it does not seem to be as effective as post testing overall,[100] others show that it is at least as effective as post-testing.[101] The pre-testing effect does appear to be more target focused on the specific material to be learned and should not be seen as correlated with more generalised curiosity.[102] While the strategy has been demonstrated to have learning benefits across different age groups and subject matters, it also appears to be more suited for more concrete material such as learning facts and concepts. It can be used with a variety of materials, including reading passages, videos, and live lectures.[103]

Practice methods[edit]
When compared to concept mapping alone, retrieval practice is more beneficial,[104] despite students not seeing retrieval practice as a useful learning tool.[105] When combined, learner performance was increased, suggesting concept mapping is a tool that should be combined with retrieval practice[106] alongside other non-verbal responses.[107] Retrieval helps with mental organization[108] which can work well with concept mapping. Multimedia testing can be used[109] alongside flashcards as a method of retrieval practice but removing cards too early can result in lower long term retention.[110] Individuals may not correctly interpret the outcome of practice cards[111] contributing to dropped cards which impact future retrieval attempts [112] therefore resulting in lower results due to increased forgetting.[60]
It is advised that students,[113] people in care units[114] and teaching professionals[115][116][117][118] use distributed[119] retrieval practice[120] with feedback to aid their studies.[121] Interleaved practice, self-explanation,[2] and elaborative interrogation[113] can be useful but need more research.[122]  Summarization can be useful for individuals trained how to use to get the most from it.[123] Keyword mnemonics and imagery for text have been somewhat helpful but the effects are often short lived.[124][113] However, if each of these methods are integrated with retrieval elements the testing effect is more likely to occur.

Test benefits[edit]
A list of benefits of retrieval practice.[125]

Aids later retention

Prevents interference from prior material in future learning
Aids transfer of knowledge to new contexts
Aids knowledge organization
Aids retrieval of untested information
Improves metacognitive monitoring
Provides feedback to instructors
Frequent testing encourages study intentions
Quizzes[edit]
A meta-analysis found the following links between frequent low-stakes quizzes in real classes and improved student academic performance:[126]

There was an association between the use of quizzes and academic performance.
This association was stronger in psychology classes
This association was stronger in all classes when quiz performance could improve class grades.
Students doing well on quizzes tended to lead to students doing well on final exams
Regular quizzing increased the chances of students passing classes
Transfer of learning[edit]
Learning using retrieval practice appears to be one of the most effective methods for promoting transfer of learning. In particular the following three techniques have been identified as particularly beneficial for transfer especially when combined with feedback: i) Implementing broad rather than narrow retrieval exercises ii) Encouraging meaningful explanations of concepts or topics iii) Using a variety of complexity and formats with questions such as retrieval questions that require inference.[127]

Considerations[edit]
Complex materials[edit]
Some researchers have applied aspects of cognitive load theory to suggest the testing effect may disappear with increasing task difficulty due to increased element interactivity.[128] This has been addressed in the literature with studies that show complex learning is benefitted by retrieval practice.[129] Further research has demonstrated that higher-order retrieval does not need to be based on a lower-level factual recall, and that from the beginning of the learning period, both should be combined for best effect.[130]

Future research[edit]
It has been suggested that as most studies on the impact of retrieval practice were conducted in WEIRD countries, this could cause a bias which should be explored in further studies.[118]

Lady Marian is a character portrayed by Lucy Griffiths in the BBC television serial Robin Hood.[1] She is the daughter of the former Sheriff of Nottingham.


Description[edit]
Marian is 21 years old, and in contrast to most Robin Hood legends, is not described as Maid Marian, but rather Lady Marian. This is because "In those days [21] would be considered quite old to still be a maid," according to actress Lucy Griffiths.[2] Griffiths was 18 during auditions for the role and 19 during filming.[1][3]
Marian is beautiful and carries some status with her, as the daughter of Edward, the old Sheriff.
Marian is characterized as headstrong and no-nonsense, if often derisive of Robin's arrogance and cocky attitude towards her. But despite this, her love for him is evident as the series progresses, and they share many tender moments in secret.

Story[edit]
First series[edit]
She was engaged to Robin Hood before he went to fight in the crusades but is visibly cold and aloof toward him on his return.[4] In episode 12 she later admits that she considered him a hero even while calling him a fool. She is initially disapproving of Robin's outlaw status because she believes he best way to fight injustice is to work inside the system. However, she aids him in his fight against the Sheriff by frequently spying for him and giving him inside information that she has picked up in the Sheriff's castle, and from Guy of Gisborne. Marian also fights the Sheriff in her own right, disguising herself as the Night Watchman and giving the poor food and supplies.[3]
Gisborne, a dispossessed lord and Vaisey's right-hand man, falls in love with Marian.[5] She resists his attentions and gifts, unable to look past his murderous ways and cruelty. But as time goes on, Guy realizes that beyond her status and beauty, he wonders if her pure heart and empathy could end his compulsive evil and bring about his redemption upon marriage. She is coerced by Guy into agreeing to marry him when King Richard returns to England. Though she does not love him, she does agrees to the union to protect both herself and her father from his wrath.
When King Richard appears to return to England (but is, in fact, an impostor), Marian must fulfill her promise to marry Guy, and he immediately prepares their wedding. In one final act of defiance against him, she dresses as the Night Watchman and attempts to steal from him, but he stabs her as she makes her escape, unaware that she is Marian. Djaq nurses her and manages to revive her when she goes into cardiac arrest. Soon after though, Marian apparently dies, and the penultimate episode of the first series ends with Robin mourning over her body and confessing his love for her. It is revealed in the following episode that her body merely shut down as a result of a concoction that she had been given by Guy's physician Pitts.
Regaining her health shortly afterwards, Marian arrives to marry Guy. The wedding is interrupted by a frantic Much, who informs her that the King is an impostor, and that it is a ruse by the Sheriff, and Guy to weed out the Sheriff's enemies. In the hope that she will forgive him, Guy admits that he knew of the plan, but Marian punches him and flees the wedding. Robin rides up on horseback to greet her and Much, and Marian rides off with him. When they arrive at the castle to expose the Sheriff's plot, she and Robin kiss.

Second series[edit]
In the second series, Marian and her father are under house arrest in Nottingham Castle. Marian cannot travel out of the castle without an armed guard, although she manages to avoid one due to Robin's men creating a diversion, or her being allowed a day off by Guy. With these methods of avoiding an armed chaperon, Marian manages to successfully deliver information to Robin. It is evident that Robin and Marian's relationship has grown stronger; however, Marian seems to be in a love triangle with Robin and Guy. Guy is still ignorant of her being Night Watchman, and Robin's informer, and harbours deep feelings for her. However, she remains faithful to Robin. Also in the second series, she discovers several uses for her beauty and her role as a Lady to manipulate Guy's feelings for her. She keeps him believing that he still has a chance to win her heart so she is able to stay close to him and get information to help Robin.
When her father dies, she agrees to join Robin in Sherwood Forest, despite several heated arguments as to whether it is the right thing to do. They eventually decide the most important thing is not their happiness, but keeping Nottingham safe and looked after.
In Lardner's Ring, Episode 9 of the series, Robin proposes to Marian. She accepts his hand and his ring, although by the end of the episode, she is once more back in the castle with Guy. Later on, she hides the ring from Guy, wearing it only in private.
In the final episode of series 2 (We Are Robin Hood!), Marian shields King Richard as Guy advances on the injured King. She admits her relationship with Robin and how she would rather die than be with Guy, to which he responds by attacking her, and stabbing her with his sword.[1][6] Robin arrives as Guy retreats with the Sheriff. Marian marries Robin while she lies dying. She then dies in her husband's arms and is carried to her grave.[7][8]

Third series[edit]
Lady Marian returns as a ghost as Robin is dying in the last episode Something Worth Fighting For Part 2.[1]

Armero is a municipality in the Tolima Department, Colombia. According to the National Department of Statistics of Colombia, 12,852 lived in the town in 2005. Its median temperature is 27 °C. It was founded in 1895, but was not officially recognized as the seat of the region until 29 September 1908, by President Rafael Reyes. The town was originally named San Lorenzo. In 1930, the name was changed to Armero in memory of José León Armero, a national martyr.[1]
Because the region became the main cotton producer in the country, the city was called Colombia's White City. It was a prosperous agricultural area until 1985.
The original seat of the region was destroyed on 13 November 1985, after an eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz Volcano produced lahars that buried the town and killed about 23,000 people. Approximately 31,000 people lived in the area at the time. The incident became known as the Armero tragedy. While the destruction of the town made world news in its own right, the best known victim was Omayra Sánchez, a young girl who died after being trapped by water and concrete up to her neck for three days. After this event, the town of Guayabal was assigned as the seat of the municipality of Armero, rendering Armero a ghost town.
The survivors were relocated to the towns of Guayabal and Lérida where they received housing and money, although little was done in aiding the survivors in reconstructing their lives.
In the area where the city was located, survivors created an extensive cemetery. Where each one had a house, they constructed a tomb with an epitaph. In this way, they constructed a new symbolic city called Camposanto.
Armando Armero is a foundation set up to bring social and economic development to a zone that has been devastated in the aftermath of the last eruption of Ruiz. It has created the Centro de Interpretación de la Memoria y la Tragedia de Armero, the first Memory Interpretation Center of a Natural Catastrophe in the world located exactly where the events occurred. There are memorial sites at each of the important places of the city (such as hospitals, parks, and theaters) near the ruins. In those, visitors can learn about the city as they existed before the tragedy.

Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis CentreAgency overviewFormed1989HeadquartersLevel 2, 4 National Circuit, Barton, Australian Capital TerritoryEmployees312 (2017–2018[update])[1]Minister responsibleClare O'Neil, Minister for Home Affairs (Australia)Agency executiveNicole Rose PSM, Chief Executive Officer [2]Websiteaustrac.gov.au
Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) is an Australian government financial intelligence agency responsible for monitoring financial transactions to identify money laundering, organised crime, tax evasion, welfare fraud and terrorism financing.[3] AUSTRAC was established in 1989 under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988.[4] It implements in Australia the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which Australia joined in 1990.
AUSTRAC's existence was continued under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth) (AML/CTF Act).[5] The AML/CTF Act came into effect on 12 December 2006,[6] and extended the existing monitoring regime to cover terrorism financing and designated terrorist organisations. Under Division 103 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth), it is illegal to finance terrorism.[7] The list of designated terror organisation is maintained by the Attorney-General's Department. In 2014 AUSTRAC released a report, Terrorism financing in Australia 2014, which says, "Terrorism financing poses a serious threat to Australians and Australian interests at home and abroad."[8]
AUSTRAC is a member of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units and an observer in the Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network (CARIN) and is a member of FATF and the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. It is also a member of the Asset Recovery Interagency Network Asia Pacific.
Certain classes of financial services are required to be reported to AUSTRAC, in particular bank cash transactions (i.e., notes and coins) of A$10,000 or more, as well as suspicious transactions and all international transfers. The reporting requirements extend to digital currency transactions. Reports to AUSTRAC must be made within 10 business days.[9] The information that AUSTRAC collects is available for use by law enforcement, revenue, regulatory, security and other agencies.


Operation[edit]
The transactions that "reporting entities" are required to report to AUSTRAC include:

cash transactions of A$10,000 or more, or foreign currency of that value,
international funds transfer instructions, either into or out of Australia, of any amount, and
suspicious transactions of any kind, being transactions the dealer may reasonably suspect of being part of tax evasion or crime, or might assist in a prosecution.
Australia's cash controls require travellers to report to AUSTRAC when they carry $10,000 or more (or equivalent in a foreign currency) of cash (or equivalent) into or out of Australia, which can be done on forms available from the Border Force at airports and sea ports.[10] The Border Force attempts to detect evasion of this requirement. Airlines are not liable for what their passengers carry. Cross-border movement of bearer negotiable instruments of any amount must also be reported if requested by a Border Force or police officer.
Digital currency exchanges are required to monitor transactions and report any suspicious activity or transactions over $10,000. 
It's an offence under the Act for anyone to split a transaction into two or more parts if the dominant purpose is to avoid reporting rules and thresholds.
Certain classes of transactions are exempt, or may be exempted on application. For example, established customers transacting amounts typical of their lawful business, such as for payroll, or retail or vending machine takings, etc. Motor vehicle traders are specifically not eligible for exemption, as are boats, farm machinery and aircraft traders.
Under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, any person can access records held by AUSTRAC, subject to certain exemptions.[11][12]

Reporting entities[edit]
Entities which are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC are called "reporting entities", which are specified in the AML/CTF Act. These entities deal in cash, bullion, cryptocurrencies and financial transactions, and include:

banks and similar financial institutions, such as building societies
corporations
insurance companies and intermediaries
securities dealers, such as stock brokers
unit trust managers and trustees (but cash management trusts transacting only by cheque or similar are exempt)
traveler's cheque or money order issuers
cash carriers and payroll preparation businesses
casinos
bookmakers, including totalisator agencies
bullion dealers
solicitors, acting on their own behalf (e.g., their trust fund, or originated mortgages)
digital currency exchange providers.[13]
Identification[edit]
Reporting entities must identify their customers using the 100-point check system.  Accounts may be opened without identification, but can only be operated (i.e., withdrawals made) by an identified customer, and an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals. Generally, identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution.
For banks and similar reporting entities, identification requirements are determined by a risk-based approach, which may differ for each reporting entity.
It's an offence to open or operate an account with a reporting entity under an alias or false name, punishable by a fine or up to 2 years imprisonment.

Other agencies[edit]
The information that AUSTRAC collects is also available to a large number of government agencies, including:

Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
State and territory revenue offices
Child Support Agency Australia (CSA)
Australian Federal Police (AFP), and which may then communicate information to foreign law enforcement agencies, with appropriate undertakings
State and territory police services
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)
Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)
Department of Home Affairs, Australia
Centrelink (added in 2004)
State commissions and royal commissions against corruption –
Crime and Misconduct Commission, Queensland
Corruption and Crime Commission, Western Australia (added in 2004)
Independent Commission Against Corruption, New South Wales
New South Wales Crime Commission
Police Integrity Commission, New South Wales
Foreign countries, with appropriate undertakings.
Breaches[edit]
One prominent attempted evasion of the AUSTRAC rules took place ahead of the Dutch takeover of TNT (see TNT N.V.) in 1999.  Simon Hannes was an executive at Macquarie Bank, which was advising TNT, and he bought about $90,000 of TNT call options under the name "Mark Booth" to profit when the bid was announced.  He was convicted of insider trading but also of two offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act since he had made multiple cash withdrawals and deposits each just under the $10,000 threshold, apparently to avoid that reporting. His sentence for those transactions was 4 months jail.[14][15]
In March 2017, AUSTRAC fined Tabcorp Holdings Limited $45 million for breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Tabcorp were found to have failed to make reports of suspicious behaviour on 108 occasions over more than five years. In the agreed facts put forward to the Federal Court by AUSTRAC and Tabcorp, Tabcorp directors were not made aware of any significant deficiencies in the company's AML/CTF program, until such matters were raised directly with Tabcorp by AUSTRAC, in 2014.[16][17]
On 3 August 2017, AUSTRAC took action against the Commonwealth Bank alleging that it did not report cash transactions over $10,000 within the required 10 business day period, or at all. The alleged breaches involved over 53,700 transactions over $10,000 through a type of ATM that allowed anonymous cash deposits up to $20,000.[9] In June 2018, the Commonwealth Bank agreed to pay a $700 million fine to settle the action, with CBA admitting to a host of breaches, including that millions of dollars were laundered through its ATMs by criminals including drug and firearms importers and that CBA failed to properly file more than 53,000 reports to Austrac over cash deposits of more than $10,000 in its ATMs. CBA also admitted that 149 “suspicious matter reports” were filed late, or not at all.[18]
In November 2019, AUSTRAC took action against Westpac alleging "systemic non-compliance" with AML/CTF 23 million times and covering $11 billion of transactions, involving the failure to properly vet thousands of transactions that could be linked to child exploitation and live child sex shows in the Philippines and other parts of south-east Asia.[19]
A Crown Resorts executive authorised the transfer of $500,000 to a drug trafficker and nightclub operator in January 2017, which was not reported to AUSTRAC for a year.[20]

Yer Favourites is a two-disc compilation album by the Tragically Hip. The tracks for Yer Favourites were selected by the band's fans on its website and were remastered. The compilation includes a total of seven songs from Fully Completely (the most songs of any album on the compilation), six songs from Road Apples, five songs from Phantom Power, four songs from Up to Here, four songs from Day for Night, two songs from Trouble at the Henhouse, two songs from Music @ Work, two songs from In Violet Light, two songs from In Between Evolution and one song from the band's self-titled EP. It also included two new songs, "No Threat" and "The New Maybe". It was released both as a stand-alone two-disc set and as part of the Hipeponymous box set. The compilation debuted at number 8 on the Canadian Albums Chart in 2005.[2] In 2016, the compilation re-entered the Canadian Albums Chart, contemporaneous with the release of Man Machine Poem and the announcement of lead singer Gord Downie's cancer diagnosis.[3]
Following the Tragically Hip's final concert of their Man Machine Poem Tour, which was broadcast live on CBC and watched by 11.7 million people,[4] the compilation reached number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart.[5] It returned to the Canadian charts again in October 2017 following Downie's death, immediately rising from #182 to #2.[6]

The Framley ExaminerType of siteNewspaper parodyHumor websiteAvailable inEnglishURLframleyexaminer.comLaunched2001
The Framley Examiner is a parody of a newspaper in a small provincial English town, created as a website and later a book. It is written by Robin Halstead, Jason Hazeley, Alex Morris and Joel Morris.


History[edit]
The Framley Examiner originally began as a website, started in 2001.[1][2]
Its success then spawned a book The Framley Examiner (ISBN 0-7181-4579-8)[1][3] described on the cover as "the book of the website of the newspaper".
A second book, Historic Framley (ISBN 0-14-101528-4), was later published, produced in association with Framley Museum.
Its writers are regular contributors to Viz magazine.  The book Bollocks to Alton Towers (ISBN 0-7181-4791-X), published in April 2005, by the same authors, is a non-fiction book unrelated to The Framley Examiner.
The website was last updated on 23 July 2013, but more recent posts have been made to social media accounts.
In May 2020, the Framley Examiner website was updated to reveal the launch of a crowd-funding appeal via Unbound with the aim of publishing the now out-of-print Framley Examiner along with additional, previously unpublished material.[4]
The father of Joel and Alex Morris worked as a local journalist in Chelmsford, Essex, but the group have dismissed any connection of Framley to the town, saying that "It wasn't meant to be targeting one particular rag."[1]

Professor Arthur Bostrom, who meddles with the fabric of time and space, yet always declares "Experiment successful".  Reference: Arthur Bostrom, actor who played the part of an English policeman in the BBC sitcom 'Allo 'Allo! in the 1980s.
A man named Mr. Hollyhock who is always trying to sell his daughter Josie or her possessions in the classified ads.
The Wripple Vetivers, a local secret society.  They are routinely consulted by the US Treasury about proposed changes to US banknotes.  The US Treasury forgot to do this only once, with grim but unspecified consequences.
Estelle Donne, who has appeared in about a dozen wedding announcements. Reference: Don Estelle, actor best known for his appearance in the BBC sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum.
Fluff, which is apparently a mainstay of Whoft's economy.
Mayor William D'Ainty, a flamboyant and possibly insane man who mounts ever more outrageous stunts in order to relieve the tedium of ruling Framley. Reference: the late Billy Dainty, a music hall and television comic
Vince Previous, an unsavoury fellow who frequently places adverts offering various kinds of massage for ladies.
Ianbeale Steeplecocque, MP for the district, whose sole concern is the effect of time travel on the local economy and infrastructure.  Given the continued meddling of Professor Bostrom, his concerns may be justified.  He was recently ousted in a cash for crisps scandal.  Reference: Ian Beale is a character in the BBC soap EastEnders.
A constant desire for a Black and Decker Dinnermate and to go at any length to get one. For example, in one ad: "Fountain of Knowledge, will swap for Elixir of Youth or Black and Decker Dinnermate".  Reference: portable workbench the Black & Decker Workmate.
Framley's twin town, Baden Schleissgarten ASF, and its mayor, Claus Freneddt, occasionally appear in the Examiner. Mayor Freneddt once ordered the Framley council to put up posters saying "your town stinks" across the town.
Roy Newby, a rake magnate who owns most of the shops in the Framley area under the brand of "Newby's of Molford", including the NcNewby's fast food restaurant.

The NCI-60 cancer cell line panel is a group of 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for the screening of compounds to detect potential anticancer activity.[1]


Purpose[edit]
The screening procedure is called the NCI-60 Human Tumor Cell Lines Screen, and it is one of the Discovery & Development Services of NCI's Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP).[2][3][4]
The screening rates for each cell line the cytostatic and cytotoxic impact of tested substances.[2]
Due to the diversity of the cell lines, it is possible to compare tested compounds by their effect patterns, high correlation potentially corresponding to similar effect mechanisms.[2]
An automated comparison against a database of more than 88,000 pure compounds and more than 34,000 crude extracts (as of 6 January 2017[update]) is provided by the COMPARE tool, which shows a list of substances ranked by the Pearson correlation coefficients for a given test substance.[5]
The same panel is used in the Molecular Target Program for the characterization of  molecular targets. Measurements include protein levels, RNA measurements, mutation status and enzyme activity levels.[6]

Cell Lines[edit]
The panel holds cell lines representing leukemia, melanoma, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, and cancers of the brain, ovary, breast, colon, kidney, and prostate.[1][2]
13 additional cell lines are evaluated for use in the screening program,
among them two lines deriving from so far not represented small-cell lung carcinoma.[1]
All cell lines but one (as of 6 January 2017[update]) are available to other laboratories, including the additional cell lines.[1]

Misidentification and Misclassification[edit]
Starting around the turn of the millennium, several cell lines were found to be misidentified or misclassified at the time of investigation or earlier:[7][8][9]
MDA-MB-435, originally classified as breast cancer cell line, was identified as being a melanoma cell line.[7]
When investigated further, current MDA-MB-435 appeared to be derived from the same individual as cell line M14.[7]
An examination of clones made clear that the mixup with M14 happened very early in the history of MDA-MB-435, before establishment in the Developmental Therapeutics Program.[7]
NCI/ADR-RES, originally classified as breast cancer cell line, was identified as being an ovarian tumor cell line.[8]
NCI/ADR-RES appears to have been derived at some point in time from cell line OVCAR-8.[8]
Originally the cell line was named MCF-7/ADR-RES; it was renamed together with the change in classification.[8]
Two brain cancer cell lines, SNB-19 and U251, were discovered to come from the same person.[9]
This makes a mixup likely.
A 61st cell line, MDA-N, has been confirmed to being derived from the misclassified MDA-MB-435 cell line.[7]
So it is also misclassified, really being a melanoma cell line, but as of 6 January 2018[update] the official website still lists it as breast cancer cell line.[1]
This cell line is not available as of 6 January 2018[update].[1]
The International Cell Line Authentication Committee maintains a list of contaminated cell lines.[10]
It includes the cell lines reported above, although usually with reporting dates and articles considerably later than the first dates and articles rising specific concern regarding the respective cell line.[10][7][8][9]

Continued Use of Wrong Classification[edit]
As of 2014[update] Hundreds of research studies still use MDA-MB-435 as model of breast cancer, even after it was officially declared to be a melanoma cell line in 2007, and even in highest-rated international peer-reviewed journals.[11]
Similar is true for other misidentified cell lines.[11]

Trischa Zorn (born June 1, 1964, in Orange, California)[1] is an American Paralympic swimmer. Blind from birth, she competed in Paralympic swimming (S12, SB12, and SM12 disability categories).[1] She is the most successful athlete in the history of the Paralympic Games, having won 55 medals (41 gold, 9 silver, and 5 bronze),[2] and was inducted into the Paralympic Hall of Fame in 2012.[3]  She took the Paralympic Oath for athletes at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta.[4]


Biography[edit]
Zorn studied special education at the University of Nebraska and school administration and supervision at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and law at the IU Robert H. McKinney School of Law.[5]
She competed in the 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004 Paralympic Games and won a combined total of 55 medals (41 gold, 9 silver, 5 bronze).[1][2][6][7][8][9] In the 1996 Games in Atlanta, she won more medals than any other athlete: two gold, three silver and three bronze. She had also topped the individual medal table at the 1992 Paralympic Games in Barcelona,[1] with ten gold medals and two silver.[10] She had won seven gold medals during her first Games in 1980.[11]
After the Sydney Games in 2000, she also held eight world records in her disability category (50 m backstroke, 100 m backstroke, 200 m backstroke, 200 m individual medley, 400 m individual medley, 200 m breaststroke, 4×50 m medley relay, 4×50 m free relay).[12]
On 1 January 2005, Zorn was one of eight athletes honoured during New Year celebrations in Times Square in New York City. The other seven were Ian Thorpe of Australia, Nadia Comăneci of Romania, George Weah of Liberia, Françoise Mbango Etone of Cameroon, Gao Min of China, Félix Sánchez of the Dominican Republic and Bart Conner of the United States. The eight athletes were "centre stage during the festivities in the countdown leading up to ringing in the New Year".[2] In 2012, she was inducted into the International Paralympian Hall of Fame.[13]
Although no longer competing as a swimmer, Zorn works as a legal professional for the Department of Veterans Affairs and lives near Indianapolis, Indiana.[14]

Paralympic medals[edit]
The medals without relay races from 1980 Summer Paralympics to 1988 Summer Paralympics, are 46 (32, 9, 5) for IPC.[15] The relay team of United States, in the category of Zorn, won 5 gold and 1 silver in these three Paralympics. The question marks in the infobox refer however to 9 gold medals (not 5 gold and 1 silver medal), this is to confirm the total number of 55 (of which 41 gold), reported in many websites including that of the official IPC in another of his article.[11]

US5 was a multinational pop boy band. The band originated in 2005 on the German RTL II television reality show Big in America and debuted in June of the same year on Lou Pearlman’s Transcontinental label. US5 became successful throughout central Europe with their first album Here We Go and with several hit records thereafter.


Career[edit]
US5 enjoyed success, gaining their first Gold Record in America from their first single called "Maria" released in 2005.[1] The same song went straight in at number 1 in Germany and became a huge summer hit in several other European countries. On the back of the success of "Maria" their debut album titled Here We Go released in October 2005, became a huge success gaining them Gold and Platinum records in Germany and Austria.[2]
In 2006, US5 did a string of school tours and various promotions up and down the UK. This coincided with the second season of Big In America airing on UK's MTV channel. They released 'Maria' and it entered the UK top 40 at number 38. US5 continued their success in central Europe in 2006 and 2007.
Original member Mikel Johnson left the band for a solo career. He was replaced by Vincent Tomas.  In 2008, the remaining German member of the band, Chris Watrin, also decided to leave the band citing "lack of interest" as a major reason. US5 released their single "The Boys Are Back" from the successful film High School Musical 3. This was followed by a third studio album titled Around the World.
At the end of 2008, the group welcomed another new member, Cayce Clayton. With four of the five members now being American, the group decided to relocate to the USA. In 2009, Vincent Tomas decided to leave the band. Later in the year, US5 had a competition called Make US5 Again to replace Vincent Tomas. Jayson Pena ended up winning the competition. The last line-up of US5 was Richie Stringini, Izzy Gallegos, Cayce Clayton, Jayson Pena all from the United States, and Jay Khan from England.

Geoffrey de Mandeville II, 1st Earl of Essex (died September 1144) was a prominent figure during the reign of King Stephen of England. His biographer, the 19th-century historian J. H. Round, called him "the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen". That characterisation has been disputed since the later 20th century.


Early career[edit]
This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
He succeeded his father, William, sometime before 1129, possibly as early as 1116. A key portion of the family patrimony in Essex was in the King's hands. William had incurred a debt to the crown, perhaps in part due to a large fine levied in 1101 by Henry I due to his displeasure at the escape of the important political prisoner Ranulph Flambard while William was in charge of the Tower of London. The King also held the substantial estate of Geoffrey's maternal grandfather Eudo le Dapifer to which Geoffrey laid claim.
Geoffrey gained Eudo's lands and his father's offices during the shifting tides of fortunes of the two competitors for the English throne after Henry I's death in 1135. He initially supported Stephen, who sometime in 1140 (most likely May of that year) made him Earl of Essex. By 1140 or 1141, King Stephen had returned to him the lucrative manors in Essex.
He founded a Benedictine priory (later Walden Abbey) at Walden, Essex and constructed a castle there. He also contributed to Hurley Priory in Berkshire, which had been founded by his grandfather Geoffrey de Mandeville I.
After the defeat and capture of Stephen at Lincoln early in 1141, Earl Geoffrey, like many barons, acknowledged Stephen's rival Empress Matilda as his sovereign lady. She confirmed his custody of the Tower, forgave the large debts his father had incurred to the crown, granted him the Norman lands of Eudo le Dapifer, and appointed him Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, Middlesex and London.
When Stephen was released in December of that year, Earl Geoffrey returned to his original allegiance. There has been much scholarly debate over the dating of the charters he received from King Stephen and Empress Matilda. Depending on the order and timing of those documents, either Geoffrey appears to have been playing off one against the other to get what he wanted or his support was courted by the rival claimants to the throne. The king arrested the earl in 1143 and, threatened with execution, Geoffrey surrendered his castles of Pleshey and Saffron Walden as well as custody of the Tower of London to Stephen. In reaction, Earl Geoffrey launched a rebellion.

Outlaw activity and death[edit]
In 1143–1144, Earl Geoffrey maintained himself as a rebel and a bandit in the fen-country, using the Isle of Ely and Ramsey Abbey as his headquarters. He was besieged by King Stephen and met his death attacking Burwell Castle in September 1144 in consequence of an arrow wound received in a skirmish.[1] Because he had died excommunicated, his body initially was denied burial at the monastery he had founded, Walden Priory. Wrapped in lead, it was accepted eventually by the Templar community in London for burial within the Temple Church in London. His son Geoffrey III arranged for an effigy to be placed on the floor, where it can still be seen today.
Temple Church was badly damaged by bombing during World War II and its burial vaults were ransacked by looters. Many coffins were smashed and bones thrown on the floor, and the skull of Geoffrey de Mandeville was stolen, placing suspicion for the theft on a private collector.[2]

Significance[edit]
His career is interesting for several reasons. The charters he received from King Stephen and Empress Matilda illustrate the ambitions of English barons. The most important concessions are grants of offices and jurisdictions, which had the effect of making Mandeville almost a viceroy with full powers in Essex and Hertfordshire, Middlesex and London, but these were based on offices and jurisdictions his ancestors had held. His career as an outlaw exemplifies the worst excesses of the civil wars of 1140–1147, and it is possible that the deeds of Mandeville inspired the rhetorical description of this period in the Peterborough Chronicle, when "men said openly that Christ and his saints were asleep".[1] He had seized Ramsey Abbey (near Peterborough) in 1143, expelling the monks and using Ramsey as a base for forays into the surrounding region, sacking Cambridge and other smaller settlements.[3][4]

Marriage and offspring[edit]
Geoffrey married Rohese de Vere (c. 1110–1167 or after), daughter of Aubrey de Vere II and sister of the first Earl of Oxford. He had four sons:

Arnulf/Ernulf de Mandeville, illegitimate, supported his father in rebellion and was exiled shortly after the earl's death. He returned to England, probably in the reign of King Henry II, and there witnessed several charters issued by his half-brothers, the 2nd and 3rd earls of Essex.[5]
Geoffrey III, 2nd earl of Essex (d. 1166) By a fresh grant from Henry II he was created Earl of Essex.
William II, 3rd Earl of Essex and Count of Aumale (d. 1189)[6]
Robert (d. before 1189)

Christian Salem (born 15 July 1995) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Melbourne Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). A defender, 1.81 metres (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighing 81 kilograms (179 lb), Salem plays primarily as a half-back flanker, with the ability to push into the midfield and forward line. He was recognised as a talented footballer at a young age when he represented Victoria at under 12 level. He played top-level football early when he played in both the TAC Cup and AFL Under 18 Championships as a bottom-aged player. His achievements as a junior saw him selected with the ninth pick in the 2013 AFL draft by the Melbourne Football Club and he made his AFL debut during the 2014 season.


Early life[edit]
Salem was born to Alex and Mary Salem, and is of Lebanese descent with his father being born in Lebanon.[1] His talent was recognised from a young age when he received state selection in the under-12 Victorian side.[2] He attended Brighton Grammar and played with the Robert Shaw coached first XVIIIs side from year nine, generally playing against year twelves.[3]
Salem played his junior career with the Hampton Rovers Football Club and played for the Sandringham Dragons in the TAC Cup in both 2012 and 2013.[4] He was selected to play for Victoria Metro in the 2012 AFL Under 18 Championships as a bottom-aged player and played in the winning final, kicking two goals.[5] He received a scholarship through the AIS-AFL Academy as part of their level two squad in the 2012 intake,[6] and travelled to Europe for two weeks in 2013.[1] He received mid-year state honours for the second consecutive year and played for Victoria Metro in the 2013 AFL Under 18 Championships.[7]
Salem was rated highly heading into the 2013 AFL draft and was predicted to be drafted inside the top ten due to his decision making and kicking precision, in addition, he drew comparisons to Luke Hodge, Nick Dal Santo and Dan Hannebery.[3][7][8]

AFL career[edit]
Christian Salem at training in July 2015
Salem was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with their first selection and ninth overall in the 2013 national draft.[9] During the pre-season, he suffered from a thyroid issue which saw him lose six kilograms in the month following the draft.[10] He played the start of the season in the Victorian Football League (VFL)  for Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions,[11] and after strong form in the VFL, including a thirty-two possession game in the VFL round three match against Frankston at Frankston Park,[12] he made his AFL debut a week later in the thirty-one point loss against Sydney at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round six.[13] In his seventh match, Salem was pivotal in Melbourne's comeback victory against Essendon in round thirteen,[14] after marking the ball thirty metres directly in front of goal, he kicked the winning goal with nineteen seconds left in the match, giving Melbourne a one-point lead.[15] He finished his debut season with twelve matches[16] and senior Herald Sun football writer, Jay Clark, wrote he had the potential to become one of Melbourne's best players.[17]
After playing his debut season in the forward line and a majority of matches as the substitute,[18] Salem changed positions in 2015 and played predominantly on the half-back line.[19][20] Playing the first seven matches of the season, he injured his hamstring in the round seven loss to Hawthorn and was initially ruled out for a month,[21] however, after injuring his other hamstring,[22] he ultimately missed two months and returned from injury playing in the VFL in round sixteen,[23] before returning to the senior side in round twenty-one in the twenty-three point loss against Carlton at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[24] He played the remainder of the season and finished with ten matches overall.[25]
After declaring his intentions to play in the midfield,[26][27] Salem retained his spot on the half-back line whilst also playing on the wing and prior to the season, he was labelled as one of the players who could have a breakout season by AFL Media journalist, Ben Guthrie.[28] Entrusted with the kick-ins for the season[29] due to his elite kicking skills,[30] Salem played the first six matches of the season before suffering from a concussion as a result of a head clash during the thirty-nine point loss against St Kilda at Etihad Stadium in round six.[31] He returned two weeks later for the thirty-two point loss against the Western Bulldogs at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[32] After being omitted the next week and playing for Casey in the VFL, a recurrence of his thyroid issue would see him miss two months of any form of football,[33] and he returned for Casey when he played against Coburg in round seventeen of the VFL season.[34] After playing the next three weeks in the VFL, he returned to the senior side for the final match of the year in the 111-point loss against Geelong at Simonds Stadium, which saw him finish with eight matches for the season.[35] His time in the VFL saw him qualify for the finals, and he played in the winning preliminary final against Williamstown in which he was stretchered off in the second quarter after losing consciousness from a tackle where his head hit the ground heavily.[36] He subsequently missed the grand final, in which Casey lost to Footscray by thirty-one points at Etihad Stadium.[37]

Salem handballing away from Collingwood's, Alex Fasolo, during round 12, 2017.
During the 2017 preseason, senior coach, Simon Goodwin, earmarked a move into the midfield for Salem in the upcoming season,[38] however, he suffered a mishap during preseason training, in which he received his third concussion in 2016 due to a brick in his backpack hitting his head during a preseason camp in December.[39] Despite the injury, he returned to full fitness in time for the start of the season and played in the opening round match against St Kilda at Etihad Stadium.[40] The next week in the twenty-two point win against Carlton at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, he recorded a career-high thirty-one disposals, in addition to seven marks, seven rebound 50s, three tackles and a goal, to be named the best player on the field by AFL Media journalist, Ben Collins.[41] In what was labelled his breakthrough game by Herald Sun reporter, Jay Clark,[42] he received the maximum three Brownlow Medal votes, meaning he was adjudged the best player on the ground by the field umpires.[25]
Salem played the first nine matches of the season, until he was suspended for the round ten match against Gold Coast at TIO Traeger Park due to striking North Melbourne's, Shaun Higgins, in the fourteen point loss the week before.[43] He received high praise from the media during the first half of the season, with The Age journalist, Chloe Saltau, writing Salem's "polish and calm" was a key reason behind Melbourne's improved form,[44] Fox Sport Australia's, Anna Harington, noted he was enjoying a breakout season and his elite kicking was a "valuable asset" to Melbourne,[45] and AFL Media reporter, Ben Guthrie, reiterated by stating his "elite ball use and composure under pressure [was] proving to be an important component of Melbourne's side."[46] Furthermore, he was named in AFL Media's team of the week for his performances in the round two match against Carlton and the round thirteen match against the Western Bulldogs.[47][48]
Missing just the one match from rounds one to fourteen, Salem was forced to miss four weeks of football after sustaining a hamstring injury during the three-point win against West Coast at Domain Stadium in round fourteen.[49] He returned for the twenty-three point win against Port Adelaide at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round eighteen,[50] and played three matches before he was omitted for the round twenty-one match against St Kilda at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.[51] The same weekend when he was playing in the VFL, he was suspended for one week for striking Carlton forward, Liam Sumner, thus ruling him ineligible for selection for the round twenty-two match against Brisbane.[52] He returned for the final round match against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and finished with sixteen matches for the season.[25]

NGC 4324 is a lenticular galaxy[3] located about 85 million light-years away[4] in the constellation Virgo. It was discovered by astronomer Heinrich d'Arrest on March 4, 1862.[5] NGC 4324 has a stellar mass of 5.62 × 1010 M☉, and a baryonic mass of 5.88 × 1010 M☉. The galaxy's total mass is around 5.25 × 1011 M☉.[2] NGC 4324 is notable for having a ring of star formation surrounding its nucleus.[6][7][8] It was considered a member of the Virgo II Groups until 1999, when its distance was recalculated and it was placed in the Virgo W Group.[9][10]


Physical characteristics[edit]
First discovered in 1957 by Russian astronomer Kirill Ogorodnikov and described by Ogorodnikov as "a system of planet-like concentrations similar to beads" and as "equally-spaced bead-like concentrations of equal size and brightness similar to the annular nebula of Kant-Lapace nebular hypothesis.",[11] NGC 4324 features an inner ring that surrounds the nucleus. The ring appears complete[12] but broken on opposite sides of its diameter[11] which led to Burstein et al. suggesting that the ring is not a ring at all but instead tightly wound spiral arms and that NGC 4324 is a misclassified spiral or lenticular galaxy.[13] Despite this, the ring is considered to be a true ring. The ring hosts most of the molecular gas observed in NGC 4324 with roughly 1.7 × 109 M☉ of HI (neutral hydrogen) and 9 × 107 M☉ of HII (singly-ionised hydrogen).[7] Despite this, HI was detected by Duprie et al. in 1996 that extends roughly 2 optical diameters suggesting that atomic hydrogen is not only concentrated in the ring.[6]
In Ultraviolet light, the ring is bright, due to the presence of star formation[6][7][8] that is occurring at an estimated rate of roughly 0.052 ± 0.021 M☉ per year,[14] with star formation being segregated in the ring.[6] In between the ring and the bulge of NGC 4324, there are tightly wound spiral arms that are defined mostly by dust.[12][15]
The gas in the ring in NGC 4324 may have been accredited from filaments of galaxies or minor merging with gas-rich satellite galaxies.[7]

Stellar populations[edit]
In the center of NGC 4324, the stellar population has a mean age of about 8 billion years, with an abundance ratio that is close to the sun, at [Mg/Fe]  0, and a metallicity that is slightly supersolar, at [Z/H] ~ +0.1. This suggests continuous effective star formation in the nucleus of NGC 4324. In the bulge of NGC 4324, the mean age of the stellar population is around 13 billion years, with abundance ratio of [Mg/Fe] = +0.15, and a metallicity of [Z/H] = −0.2 L −0.3. In the inner part of the disk of NGC 4324, the stellar population is old, with an abundance ratio of [Mg/Fe] = +0.2, and a metallicity of [Z/H] < −0.33. Such characteristics imply a brief single starburst took place more than 10 billion ago and formed the stellar disk of NGC 4324. In the ring-dominated area of the disk, the dominant stellar population is also old, despite being slightly younger than in the inner disk, and has chemical properties similar to the stars of the inner disk.[7]

Activity[edit]
NGC 4324 is classified as a Seyfert Galaxy[16][17] and as a LINER galaxy.[18][16] Despite being classified as a Seyfert galaxy, NGC 4324 has no delectable nuclear radio continuum emission lines, suggesting that the emission lines that led to its classification as a Seyfert come from stellar processes such as photoionization driven by supernova remnants and/or planetary nebulae which can mimic the high-ionization nebular emission characteristic of the nuclei of other observed Seyfert Galaxies. This is despite the fact that NGC 4324 is host to a supermassive black hole with an estimated mass of 2.187 × 106 M☉.[19]

Group membership[edit]
NGC 4324 is listed as member of the Virgo S Cloud,[20][21] which is also known as the Virgo Southern Extension or the Virgo II Groups.[22][23] It was placed in the NGC 4303 Group by P. Fouque et al. and A. M. Garcia et al. in 1992 and 1993 respectively, which is centered on the galaxy NGC 4303,[24][25] which considered part of the Virgo Southern Extension.[26] However, later distance measurements made with the Tully-Fisher method[27][4] showed that NGC 4324 was not part of the NGC 4303 Group but was instead a member of the Virgo W Group,[28][29][30][10][31][32][4][33] which lies at twice the distance of the Virgo Cluster and is centered on the elliptical galaxy NGC 4261.[30][34]

Pyotr Grigoryevich Skripchenkov (Russian: Пётр Григорьевич Скрипченков; 14 February 1926 – 2010) competed in the period when butterfly was being split from breaststroke as a separate swimming style, and Skripchenkov was one of the first Soviet swimmers who mastered the butterfly. In 1952, he took part in the Summer Olympics in the 200 m breaststroke, when butterfly was not an Olympic event yet.[1] In 1953–1954 he swam the butterfly leg in the 4 × 100 m medley relay and helped the Soviet team to set three world records. Between 1949 and 1954 he won two national titles and set five national records. He later competed in the masters category, mostly in the 50 m butterfly event, in which he won the world championships in 1990 and several national titles.[2]
During World War II, he enlisted to the Soviet Army in 1944 and went up to Berlin with the infantry.[3]

"New Discoveries in the Eastern Ocean"
A map of the paths of James Cook and Russian explorers in the North Pacific during the 18th century, including those Gvozdev helped chart.
Mikhail Spiridonovich Gvozdev (Russian: Михаи́л Спиридо́нович Гво́здев; c. 1700 – after 1759) was a Russian military geodesist and a commander of the expedition to northern Alaska in 1732, when the Alaskan shore was sighted by Russians for the first time.[1][2]
In 1732, together with the participants of the First Kamchatka expedition navigators Ivan Fyodorov and K. Moshkov, Gvozdev sailed to Dezhnev Cape, the easternmost point of Asia, in the St. Gabriel (Святой Гавриил, Sviatoi Gavriil).[3] From there, after having replenished the water supply on 5 August, the St. Gabriel sailed east and soon came near the American mainland at Cape Prince of Wales. They charted the northwestern coast of Alaska and mapped their route. By doing this, Fyodorov and Gvozdev completed the discovery of the Bering Strait, once started by Semyon Dezhnyov and Fedot Alekseyev and continued by Bering.
Subsequently, in 1741–1742, Gvozdev participated in an expedition led by Alexey Shelting and mapped most of the western and southern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, as well as the eastern shore of Sakhalin.

Legacy[edit]
A cape on Sakhalin is named after Gvozdev.

DogglesA U.S. Army Belgian Malinois wearing Doggles to protect his eyes from dust in AfghanistanInventorRoni Di LulloManufacturerDoggles, Inc
Doggles are a commercial brand of eye protection for dogs in the form of tinted goggles designed and manufactured to fit the shape of a dog's head.
While marketed as a fashion item, several practical and medical uses have been reported, and prescription lenses for dogs with impaired eyesight are available.


Invention and construction[edit]
Doggles were invented by Roni Di Lullo after she noticed her dog, Midknight, squinting in the sunlight. Experiments were made with human sunglasses and sports goggles before a pair was developed to fit the shape of a dog's head.[1] They are now produced by the Doggles Company in Diamond Springs, California.[2]
Doggles are constructed out of a tinted polycarbonate material for UV protection, with elastic straps to secure them to the dog's head.[3]

Dog wearing Doggles while travelling on the back of a motorcycle
Doggles were ranked No. 6 in a list of "10 ideas that shouldn’t have worked – but made millions" by MSN Money,[1] and by 2004, were being sold in 4,500 shops in 16 countries[4] and now include the option of prescription lenses.[4]

Uses[edit]
A Jack Russell Terrier wearing a pair of blue Doggles.
In 2004, Linda Cunningham was organizing supply packs to be sent out to U.S. Army dogs working in Iraq. During her research she came across Doggles and thought of them as protection from the sun and also from the effects of the desert sandstorms. She contacted the Doggles Company and together they have sent over 120 pairs of Doggles out to Iraq for the military working dogs.[2] Doggles were also featured in a CNN Saturday Morning News segment about equipment being sent out to military dogs on 30 July 2005.[5]
The British newspaper Metro reported in March 2007 the story of a dog suffering from a rare autoimmune disorder which means its eyes cannot produce tears. The owner, Diana Stephens, has the dog wear Doggles in order to prevent its eyes from drying out.[6]
Uses of Doggles for other eye conditions have also been reported. Veterinarian Pete Wedderburn reported in his Daily Telegraph blog in 2009 the case of a terrier that suffered from an ophthalmological condition in which tiny specks of debris were floating around inside its eyes. When exposed to bright sunshine, the dog would twist to its side while snarling and yelping; something that was originally thought to be the exacerbation of an existing arthritis condition. A pair of Doggles was ordered, and while the terrier did not initially like wearing them, they did solve the problem. Eventually the owner found that a baseball cap designed for dogs proved to be the solution as the terrier did not mind wearing it.[7]

Thrushton is a national park in South West Queensland, Australia, 520 km West of Brisbane.
Dense mulga scrub typical of Queensland's Mulga Lands bioregion grows in this park. The park also protects flat spinifex sandplains, dry eucalypt woodlands and relics of the former sheep grazing era.
The land was previously grazed by the Gasteen and other families.[1] They lobbied for it to become a national park in the late 1980s.[2]

Hunter Valley landscape
Wendy Bowman (c. 1934 – 26 July 2023) was an Australian farmer and environmentalist in New South Wales who successfully campaigned to prevent Yancoal from developing coal mining in the Hunter Valley. In recognition of her efforts, she was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize in 2017.[1][2]

Biography[edit]
Born in the 1930s in Sydney, Wendy Bowman belonged to a family which, on her father's side, arrived in Australia in 1798, and on her mother's side settled in the Hunter Valley in the 19th century. After graduating in art, she married the Hunter Valley farmer Mick Bowman. When he died in 1984, she took over the farm. She had to relocate in 1988 as a result of open mining operations.[3]
In 1988, her crops failed when mining caused heavy metals to pollute the water which irrigated her field. As a result of coal dust in the grass, her cattle refused to eat. From 1990, first through MineWatch and later through the Hunter Environment Lobby, she assisted local farmers to take political action in New South Wales.[3] After moving her farm once, in 2005 she was given six weeks to relocate in order to make way for another mine. She settled in Rosedale in Camberwell.[2]
Bowman's Rosedale farm was itself threatened in 2010 when Yancoal planned an extension of the Ashton South East Open Cut mine to one of the main tributaries to the Hunter River. The majority of farmers in the area had sold their property by early 2015. Bowman, whose land covered more than half the coal in the proposed mine, refused to sell as she sought to protect the area from devastation. In December 2014, the Land & Environment Court ruled that Yancoal could only proceed with the mine if Bowman agreed to sell. Despite offers of millions of dollars, she continued to refuse, bringing Yancoal's efforts to a close.[2]
In recognition of her efforts, in April 2017 she was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize.[2] She died on 26 July 2023, at the age of 89.[4]

When there is 60-80% of mutated mtDNA present, that is said to be the threshold level.[1] While 60-80% is the general threshold level, this is also dependent on the individual, the specific organ in question and what the specific mutation is. There are three specific types of mitochondrial threshold effects: phenotypic threshold effect, biochemical threshold effect and translational threshold effect.[citation needed]
Threshold expression is a phenomenon in which phenotypic expression of a mitochondrial disease within an organ system occurs when the severity of the mutation, relative number of mutant mtDNA, and reliance of the organ system on oxidative phosphorylation combine in such a way that ATP production of the tissue falls below the level required by the tissue. The phenotype may be expressed even if the percentage of mutant mtDNA is below 50% if the mutation is severe enough.[citation needed]


Phenotypic threshold effect[edit]
Phenotypic threshold effect is when there is a certain amount of wild-type mtDNA present in the mitochondrion which is able to balance out the number of mutated mtDNA.[2] As a result, the phenotype is normal. However, if the number of wild-type mtDNA decreases and the number of mutant mtDNA increases, resulting in an imbalance between the two, the threshold level has been altered which causes complications. This occurs because the wild-type mtDNA present are able to keep the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis functioning despite there being a few number of them present. They are able to counterbalance the mutated mtDNA, however, when the number drops below threshold level the mutant mtDNA take over.[2]

Basil BeaumontRear-Admiral Basil Beaumont (Michael Dahl)Born1669Died1703NationalityBritish
Rear-Admiral Basil Beaumont (1669–1703) was a senior Royal Navy officer who was the fifth son, amongst the twenty-one children, of Sir Henry Beaumont, 2nd Baronet, of Stoughton Grange and Cole Orton.


Naval career[edit]
Of his early service in the navy there is no record: it was short and uneventful, and on 28 October 1688 he was appointed lieutenant of the Portsmouth. Six months later, 21 April 1689, he was appointed captain of HMS Centurion, which ship was lost in Plymouth Sound in a violent storm on 25 December of the same year. Although so young a captain, no blame attached to him. He was accordingly appointed, after some months, to HMS Dreadnought, and early in 1692 was transferred to HMS Rupert, in which ship he took part in the battle of Barfleur. He continued in the Rupert during the following year; and in 1694 commanded HMS Canterbury in the Mediterranean. In 1696 he commanded HMS Montague, in the fleet cruising in the English Channel and off Ushant, and was for a short time detached as commodore of an inshore squadron. He was afterwards transferred, at short intervals, to HMS Neptune, HMS Essex, and HMS Duke, whilst in command of the squadron off Dunkirk, during the remainder of 1696 and till the peace. In November 1698 he was appointed to HMS Resolution, and during the next year was senior officer at Spithead, with a special commission for commanding in chief and holding courts-martial (23 February 1699). In the end of August he was ordered to pay the ship off. He commissioned her again some months later, and continued in her for the next two years, for a great part of which time he lay in the Downs, commanding – as he wrote – "a number of ships of consequence, with no small trouble and a good deal of charge", on which he referred it to the lord high admiral, "if this does not require more than barely commanding as the eldest captain" (9 April 1702).
His application did not meet with immediate success; in June he was turned over to the Tilbury, and continued to command the squadron in the Downs, at the Nore, and in the North Sea, till, on 1 March 1702–3, he was promoted to rear-admiral, and directed to hoist his flag on board HMS Mary, then fitting out at Woolwich. His rank, not his service, was altered. During the summer he cruised in the North Sea and off Dunkirk, or convoyed the Baltic trade; on the approach of winter he returned to the Downs, where he anchored on 19 October. He was still there on 27 November, when the great storm (Great Storm of 1703) which "o'er pale Britannia passed", hurled the ship on to the Goodwin Sands. Every soul on board, the admiral included, was lost. The circumstances of his death have given to Beaumont's name a wider repute than his career as an officer would have otherwise entitled it to; his service throughout was creditable, without being distinguished; and the only remarkable point about it is that, after having held important commands, he attained flag-rank within fifteen years of his entry into the service, and when he was not yet thirty-four years of age.

Family and legacy[edit]
Two younger brothers, who had also entered the navy, had previously died; one, William Villiers, a lieutenant, had died of fever in the West Indies, 17 July 1697; the other, Charles, was lost in the blowing up of the Carlisle, 19 September 1700; and their mother, Lady Beaumont, after the death of the rear-admiral, memorialised the queen, praying for relief. As Lady Beaumont's second son, George, who, on the death of his elder brother, had succeeded to the title and estates, was unmarried and appointed a lord commissioner of the admiralty in 1714, the implied statement that the family was dependent on Basil is curious. The petition, however, was successful, and a pension of  £50 a year was granted to each of the six daughters.
Beaumont's portrait, by Michael Dahl, is in the Painted Hall at Greenwich, to which it was presented by King George IV; it is that of a comely young man.[DNB 1][1]

Carol Kramer (May 3, 1943 – December 3, 2002) was an American archaeologist known for conducting ethnoarchaeology research in the Middle East and South Asia.[1] Kramer also advocated for women in anthropology and archaeology, receiving the Squeaky Wheel Award from the Committee on the Status of Women in Anthropology in 1999.[1] Kramer co-wrote Ethnoarchaeology in Action (2001) with Nicolas David, the first comprehensive text on ethnoarchaeology, and received the Award for Excellence in Archaeological Analysis posthumously in 2003.[1]


Early life[edit]
Carol Kramer was born in New York City on May 3, 1943, to Aaron Kramer and Katherine Kolodny Kramer.[1] Aaron Kramer was a professor of English at Dowling College and a poet, and her mother, Katherine Kramer, was a social worker.[1] Kramer attended the High School of Music and Art before completing a B.A. at City College of New York in 1964.[1] Kramer started her graduate studies in archaeology at the University of Chicago, but after a year, transferred to the University of Pennsylvania.[1]
As a graduate student, Kramer developed interests in spatial organization and participated in excavations of archaeological sites in Godin Tepe and She Gabi, Iran.[2] Kramer received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1971.[1] Her doctoral dissertation was titled, “The Habur Ware Ceramic Assemblage of Northern Mesopotamia: An Analysis of its Distribution.”
In the 1960s-1970s, Kramer was briefly married to Christopher Hamlin who was also a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania. And so some sources related to her life, including some of her own publications, refer to her as Carol Hamlin if they were published during the 1960s and 1970s.[1]

Fieldwork[edit]
In 1968, Kramer served as a site supervisor for archaeological excavations in Dinka Tepe and Seh Girdan, Iran as part of the Hasanlu Project directed by Robert H. Dyson Jr. for the University of Pennsylvania and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[1] Kramer also worked as a site supervisor (in 1967 and 1969) and as the assistant director (in 1971 and 1973) on an archaeological excavation at Godin Tepe, Iran for the Royal Ontario Museum.[1] The Godin Project, as it was called, was directed by Louis D. Levine and T. Cyler Young Jr.[1]
Kramer was a leading researcher in the field of ethnoarchaeology. She participated in her first ethnoarchaeological fieldwork under Ruben Reina, who worked with an urban potter in Antigua, Guatemala.[1] In 1975, Kramer conducted ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in a Kurdish village in the Hamadān Province in Iran.[1] Her ethnoarchaeology research in Iran was published in Ethnoarchaeology: Implications of Ethnography for Archaeology (1979) as “An Archaeological View of a Contemporary Kurdish Village: Domestic Architecture; Household Size, and Wealth.[1] Kramer expanded on this research in her book, Village Ethnoarchaeology: Rural Iran in Archaeological Perspective (1982).[1] Village Ethnoarchaeology (1982) utilized data from her ethnographic fieldwork in Aliabad in 1975, census and map documents published by the Iranian government, and other published ethnographic data.
Kramer hoped to return to Iran to research pottery communities, but she was forced to switch her fieldwork location to India because of the outbreak of the Iranian Revolution in January 1978.[1] Kramer discussed her plans for research in India in an article, “Ceramic Ethnoarchaeology,” in the Annual Review of Archaeology.[2] This article explored the benefits of archaeological studies of ceramics, given their ubiquitous use, good preservation, and role in economic trades and ritual ceremonies.[2] Kramer researched ceramic distribution in Rajasthan in 1980 and from 1982 to 1984.[1] Her research led to many publications related to ceramics and ceramic ethnoarchaeology published between 1991 and 1995, and later her book, Pottery in Rajasthan: Ethnoarchaeology in Two Indian Cities (1997).[1]
Pottery in Rajasthan (1997) includes detailed records of potters’ shops, vessel drawings, and photographs.[2] Kramer's book also provides data on the separation of labor, labor specialization, and gender roles involved in pottery production, which she later discussed in her final paper delivered at a meeting of the Society of American Archaeologists.[2] Her book was reviewed by Charles Kolb from the National Endowment for the Humanities who noted that “the data and conclusions reported in it were valuable contributions to ethnoarchaeology and economic anthropology and served to fill in a void in our comprehension of the intricacies of ceramic production and, particularly, its distribution.[3]
Kramer returned to fieldwork in 1995 as a site supervisor for excavations in Gordion, Turkey, and returned in 1996 to explore the opportunity of conducting ethnoarchaeology research in Yassihöyük and other villages near the area of Gordion, Turkey.[1]

Ethnoarchaeology research[edit]
Kramer pioneered the technique of using data from living populations to answer archaeological questions called ethnoarchaeology. Kramer defined ethnoarchaeology as “archaeologically oriented ethnographic research designed to improve the understanding of relationships between patterned human behavior and elements of material culture."[2] Kramer's technique involved conducting ethnographic research to approach questions that archaeological data alone could not answer.[2] Kramer conducted fieldwork during the rise of Processual Archaeology, and her research focused on processual questions and testing hypotheses related to spatial studies, socioeconomic classes, and activity patterns.[2] This method was influenced by scientists utilizing cultural geography approaches at the College University of New York, including Gregory Johnson and Stephen Kowalewski.[2]
Kramer co-wrote Ethnoarchaeology in Action (2001) with Nicolas David, the first comprehensive text on ethnoarchaeology.[1] In this text, David and Kramer detail the history, theory and practice surrounding ethnoarchaeology as an approach instead of a discipline, discussing theoretical implications of the archaeological field, providing examples of ethnoarchaeological practice, and discussing the ethics of ethnographic fieldwork.[2] Ethnoarchaeology in Action(2001) was recognized as an important text in R. Alexander Bentley's Handbook of Archaeological Theories[4] and in Ian Hodder's The Present Past: An Introduction to Anthropology for Archaeologists.[5] Alok Shrotriya notes in an article, “Ceramic Ethno-archaeology and its Applications,” that Kramer carried out ethnoarchaeological research specifically for studying ancient artifacts.[6]

Professional career[edit]
Kramer began her teaching career in 1971 at Queens College. From 1974 to 1990, Kramer switched to teaching at Lehman College and then the Graduate Center at the City University of New York.[2] In 1985, Kramer served as a visiting professor at Yale University.[1] From 1986 to 1988, Kramer also taught courses at the University of Arizona supported by a National Science Foundation Visiting Professorship for Women.[1] Kramer was invited by archaeological graduate students at the University of Arizona as part of a National Science Foundation program to fund academic leadership roles for women in departments with few female faculty members.[1]
Kramer became a professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona in 1990, teaching there until her death in 2002.[1] Both Kramer and William Longacre, another faculty member at the University of Arizona, conducted ethnoarchaeology field work in the 1990s.[7] Together, Kramer and Longacre helped to guide Louise Senior's ceramic research published as “The Estimation of Prehistoric Values Cracked Pot Ideas in Archaeology,” in James Skibo, William Walker, and Axel Nielsen's Expanding Archaeology (1995).[8]
Kramer presented her research widely at professional organizations.[1] Kramer gave a 1994 Distinguished Lecture to the Archaeology Section of the American Anthropological Association titled “The Quick and the Dead: Ethnography in and for Archaeology."[1] Nan Rothschild remarked that “her reputation was international; she was a frequent participant in French conferences and lectured in Europe and South Asia."[2] Her last paper, titled “Boys and Girls Together” explored gendered roles involved in pottery creation in Rajasthan, which she presented at the Society of American Archaeology meeting in 2001.[2] Kramer also served as an issue editor for the journal Expedition.[9]

Advocacy for women in anthropology and archaeology[edit]
Kramer advocated for the professional development of women in anthropology and archaeology. In 1980, Kramer and her anthropological colleagues, including Roger Sanjek, Rayna Rapp, Carole Vance, and Glenn Peterson, drafted the “Resolution to Implement the 1972 American Anthropological Association Resolution on Fair Practices in the Employment of Women."[1] The group obtained financial support for the resolution calling for the American Anthropological Association (AAA) to censure university departments that hired or promoted few women faculty members.[1] This resolution was passed in 1981, and in that same year, the AAA censured five university departments.[1]
Along with her graduate student Miriam Stark, Kramer published “The Status of Women in Archaeology,” in the American Anthropological Association's newsletter.[10] Stark and Kramer's commentary discussed the state of gender equality in anthropology by looking at gender disparities in the number of graduate students, Ph.D. recipients, funding receipts, and faculty members.[1] This research related to gender inequality in the field of archaeology was published in a special issue of the Archaeological Papers of the American Anthropological Association, focused on “Equity Issues for Women in Anthropology."[11]
From 1973 to 1975, Kramer served as a member of the Committee on the Status of Women in Anthropology (COSWA) and the host and discussion leader at the COSWA's roundtable discussing professional development.[1] Kramer also served as the female archaeologist for the 1998 meeting for the Society for American Archaeology, and in 1999, was awarded the Squeaky Wheel Award by COSWA for her work towards equality for women anthropologists.[1]

Later life[edit]
Kramer died on December 3, 2002, in Tucson, Arizona[2] at the age of 59.[1] Kramer received the Award for Excellence in Archaeological Analysis by the Society for American Archaeology a year after her death.[1] She was survived by her sister Laura Kramer.[2] A memorial service with Kramer's colleagues and former students was held on March 9, 2003, and another memorial service was held in New York City on February 16, 2003.[12]
Nan Rothschild wrote an obituary for Carol Kramer that was published in the American Anthropologist in March 2004.[2] After Kramer's death, the Department of Anthropology at the University of Arizona created an endowed scholarship honoring the life and contributions of Carol Kramer.[12] This scholarship is awarded to graduate students interested in studying the archaeology of the ancient Near East or ethnoarchaeology.[13]
In April and May 2015, artist Marjolijn de Wit created an exhibition displayed in the Asya Geisberg Gallery in New York City, New York titled “Pots Are Not People."[14] The exhibition title refers to Kramer's article “Pots and People” published in Mountains and Lowlands: Essays in the Archaeology of Greater Mesopotamia in 1977. De Wit builds on Kramer's argument that “archaeological discoveries signify diverse and complex notions of economy and locale, as opposed to assuming a more static idea of culture."[14] The exhibit was also published into an exhibition catalogue by the same title.[15]
The Carol Kramer Papers are currently housed at the National Anthropological Archives. These papers include Kramer's field notes, correspondence, teaching files, photographs, sound recordings, maps, and botanical specimens representing her ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in Shahabad (also known as Aliabad), Iran and Rajasthan, India.[1] Her papers also include photographs and field notes from her research on the Hasanlu Project at Dalma Tepe, Iran.[1]

Ermengard of Italy (died 896/897) was Queen of Provence as the spouse of King Boso. She was the second and only surviving child of Emperor Louis II. In her early life, she was betrothed to Constantine, the junior Byzantine emperor, but whether the marriage actually occurred or not is still debated among historians. In 871, Ermengard and her family were taken hostage by Adelchis of Benevento but were later freed. In 876, Ermengard married Boso, a nobleman with connections to the Carolingian dynasty, and became queen upon his accession to the throne of Provence in 879. After her husband's death in 887, she served as regent of the kingdom during the minority of her son Louis the Blind.


Early life and engagement to Constantine[edit]
Golden coin showing Constantine (right) with Emperor Basil I (left)
Ermengard was the daughter of Emperor Louis II, who ruled over Italy, and his wife, Engelberga,.[1] Ermengard's granduncle was Emperor Charles the Bald.[2] In her youth, she was instructed in the scriptures by Anastasius Bibliothecarius, the chief archivist of the papal Lateran Palace.[3] In 869, the courts of the Carolingian and Byzantine Empires entered into discussions to arrange an alliance against the Saracens in southern Italy. During the negotiations, in addition to a military alliance, a marriage between Ermengard and Constantine, the eldest son of Emperor Basil I,[a] was proposed.[1]
Ermengard and Constantine were betrothed in 870 or 871.[6][7][8] To this end, an ambassador was sent by Louis to the Byzantine Empire.[8] The Carolingian and Frankish annals Annales Bertiniani referred to Ermengard in 879 as "filia imperatoris Italiae et desponsata imperatori Greciae" (lit. 'daughter of the emperor of Italy and engaged to the emperor of Greece'). However, the annals erroneously refer to Ermengard's betrothed as Basil, not Constantine.[1] Whether the marriage actually occurred is still debated among historians. The historians Charles Previté-Orton and Werner Ohnsorge take the position that they married, but Shaun Tougher argues that there is no evidence of this,[9] considering the arrangement more of a child's engagement than a true marriage, given that Constantine would have been either 13 or 14 at the time and many Byzantine men married at age 15.[6] Louis refused to hand over Ermengard to the patriarch sent by the Byzantines to bring her to the Byzantine Empire.[3] The alliance between the empires failed to come into fruition, and in the Prosopographie der mittelbyzantinischen Zeit (lit. 'Prosopography of the Middle Byzantine Period'), its authors, including the Byzantinist Ralph-Johannes Lilie, argue that the marriage of Ermengard and Constantine did not either. Instead, the correspondence between Louis II and Basil I reveal a feud over the right to the imperial Roman title,[1] Basil refusing to yield the status of Roman emperor to Louis.[10]
In August 871, Ermengard, along with the rest of her family, were held hostage by Adelchis of Benevento.[3] They remained in captivity until September; during that time, rumors circulated that the imperial family were dead. The bishop of Benevento managed to have them freed, and Ermengard is not mentioned by chronicles until her marriage in 876.[3]

Queen of Provence[edit]
In 876, sometime between February and June,[11] with the approval of Charles, Ermengard was married to Boso of Provence, who was a nobleman with close relations to the Carolingian dynasty.[2] Based on her betrothal to Constantine, the medievalist René Poupardin placed Ermengard somewhere between 17 and 25 years old at the time of her marriage to Boso.[12] In 879, the West Frankish king Louis the Stammerer died. Boso intended to have himself elected as the new monarch of West Francia, but ended up as ruler of Provence. His rise to the throne of Provence was aided by Ermengard and her mother Engelberga.[13] The historian Constance Bouchard states that "Ermengard was indeed quoted at the time as saying that she, daughter of the Roman emperor, who had once been affianced to the Greek emperor, would not want to live if she could not make her own husband king".[14] The couple had three surviving children: a son, Louis the Blind, and two daughters, Engelberga and an unnamed child.[15][16]
In 878, Ermengard and her husband welcomed Pope John VIII in Arles, who was fleeing Rome. The couple made a good impression on the pontiff, revealed by his correspondence with Ermengard's mother Engelberga.[17] Boso died in 887, leaving his children under the protection of Ermengard.[16] In May of that year, Ermengard travelled with her son to the court of her cousin Emperor Charles the Fat, and according to the East Frankish Annales Fuldenses, she managed to convince her cousin to, as Bouchard puts it, "'quasi-adopt' Boso's young son Louis as his own son".[15][18] In 890, Louis was elected to succeed to his father's kingdom of Provence.[15] During the minority of her son, Queen Ermengard served as regent of Provence.[19]
Ermengard died in 896/897.[20][21] In June 897, Ermengard's son Louis requested prayers for the repose of the souls of both his parents.[11]

^ While nominally the son of Basil I, some historians speculate that Constantine was actually the son of the future Michael III.[4][5]

The anti-rape movement is a sociopolitical movement[1] which is part of the movement seeking to combat violence against and the abuse of women.
The movement seeks to change community attitudes to violence against women, such as attitudes of entitlement to sex and victim blaming, and attitudes of women such as self-blame for violence. It seeks to promote changes to rape laws or laws of evidence which enable rapists to avoid penalties because, for example, victims are discouraged from reporting assaults, or because the rapist is entitled to immunity or because a rapist (as a defendant) is capable in law of denigrating the victim. The movement has been successful in jurisdictions, though many attitudes still persist, and despite changes to laws and significant increases in reporting of assaults, violence against women still persists at high levels.
The movement came about in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when new concepts of rape arose out of second wave feminism and the reevaluation of women's daily lives socially and with regard to the social institutions with which they interact. Prior to this reexamination, rape had been viewed as a "sex crime carried out by pathological men",[2] who were unable to control their own sexual desires.[3] Feminists began to emphasize the role of power dynamics specifically with regard to the perpetration of rape as a crime committed primarily by men against women.[4] This revised definition of rape was reframed from the perspective of the victim. The act of rape was asserted to be a way in which societal gender roles, the way someone acts out either masculinity or femininity, were enforced and the hierarchy of power placing males above females was maintained.[3]  Rape was thus defined as a form of violence used to ensure male power, a form of social control over women and children.[5]  Known as the "anti-rape" or "rape prevention" movement,[6] it was founded with the conceptions that sexual violence and violence against women more generally, is a tool of social control used to keep women in a subordinate position to men and that women need to take action, that aids victims of sexual violence to become "survivors" of violence instead of victims.[3] The anti-rape movement continues, with growing awareness in the United States public about the concept of rape culture, coinciding with the increasing popularity of feminism.


History[edit]
Origins[edit]
Further information: History of rape
Beginning in the late 1960s, violence against women became a salient topic of interest within the second-wave feminist movement.  Through the anti-rape movement, an offshoot of the women's movement, the public was made aware of sexual violence as an important social problem deserving of attention.[7]  Sexual violence refers to both rape and sexual assault. As early as 1970, feminists began engaging in consciousness raising groups, which involved sharing personal experiences women have had with sexual violence with the wider public. In 1971, the New York Radical Feminists sponsored the first events specifically regarding sexual violence as a social problem, the first of which was a speak-out, used to attach personal stories with the cause.[5]  On January 24, 1971, this group held the first Speak-Out, which approximately 300 people attended at St. Clement's Episcopal Church in New York, and this speak-out was followed by a conference about rape on April 12, 1971.[5] Women would come to a "speak-out" specifically to share their own experiences with an audience and to raise their voices, to literally speak out against sexual violence. These events helped increase public awareness of sexual violence as an issue deserving of attention.[8]

During the subsequent two years, feminist theorizing about rape continued. In 1975, Susan Brownmiller wrote one of the most influential pieces of literature about sexual assault of this period: Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape.[7]  In this book, Brownmiller made a direct connection between women's fear and sexual aggression, describing that sexual violence is used by men to intimidate women and keep them fearful.[3]  As the movement was able to connect a pattern of violence to personal experiences, slogans began to form, such as "the personal is political" and "there are no individual solutions".[9]
The psychological trauma from rape was generally ignored by medicinal and psychiatric professionals up until the 1950s and 1960s. In 1970 Sandra Sutherland and Donald J. Scherl published the first substantial study of the psychological effects of rape on its victims in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry.[10]
The year 1972 marks an important milestone in the anti-rape movement due to the formation of two influential organizations: Bay Area Women Against Rape (BAWAR) in Berkeley, California, and the Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center. BAWAR started by first putting together packets of information concerning important safety information, such as suggestions to follow when hitchhiking, samples of the paper materials that they use (i.e.,  memos to hospitals or police departments requesting change, requests for donations), and medical pamphlets for survivors of rape.[5]  This center also made strides to obtain city funding for their efforts to start a 24-hour crisis line, pay a part-time staff member, and fund an office, though it is unknown whether that funding was received by 1973.[5] A good case study illustrating how many Rape crisis centers actually came into being is the case of the still-active Rape Crisis Center (YWCA) of the greater Toledo area. In 1972, one woman in Toledo started helping rape victims out of her home and the local law enforcement recognized her effectiveness and related victims to her care. From this individual, grassroots effort grew the YWCA H.O.P.E. center, a vibrant and still-active rape crisis center.[citation needed]
Also in 1972, the Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center formed and began running the first telephone crisis line for victims of sexual violence to call, which has served as an example for future rape crisis centers.[11]  This center was the first rape crisis center within the United States.[3]  In 1972, the center received approximately 20 calls a day, and aside from the crisis line, the women operating this center offered an array of services, including offering legal and medical advice, emotional support, accompaniment to the hospital or law enforcement agencies, and shelter to those who called their office.[5]  By 1973, the center also had started distributing a newsletter nationally, helping to support and legitimize the anti-rape movement then gaining speed.  The Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center along with BAWAR represented two "national networking hubs" for the anti-rape movement.[12]
The national anti-rape movement was largely decentralized and spread across the United States. It was made-up of several main organizations which constituted "hubs" for the movement, like BAWAR and the Washington, D.C. Rape Crisis Center, which acted as crucial networking sites for the movement, as well as a wide array of less influential centers spread throughout the US.[5] These less influential organizations remained connected to the movement often through the active feminist press of this time.[5] The national movement provided local movement organizations with support. The first national coalition among these centers did not form until 1974, with the creation of the Feminist Alliance Against Rape (FAAR) in Washington, D.C.[5]
In the early stages of the anti-rape movement, the movement's foci included "…law enforcement behavior and legal changes, hospital practices and counseling, self-defense and community education."[13] The National Organization for Women (NOW) started working on legislative reform at the national level during the mid-1970s. This organization was the first to initiate legislative reform, helping to lead all 50 states to change their laws in various ways within the decade. These reformed laws served to encourage those who have been raped to report these crimes and improved methods for prosecuting perpetrators of this violence.[7]  Specifically, by 1980 most states in the US had changed their laws to:
1. Include that it is illegal for a spouse to rape their spouse.
2. Include "rape shield laws," which in part serve to limit using a victim's sexual history in court to potentially be used against them.
3. Make it unnecessary to have a witness of the rape.
4. Change the age constituting statutory rape from 10 to 12.
5. Alter the definition constituting consent to demonstrate "…the difference between consent and submission (when, on account of fear, the victim does not physically resist)" and show that there is a difference between giving someone consent (agreeing to engage in a sexual act) and not giving someone consent to engage in a sexual act (for example, a person cannot give consent when they are passed out).[7]
In 1975, the National Center for the Prevention and Control of Rape at the National Institute of Mental Health was formed.[7]  The creation of this organization led to a wide expansion of research concerning sexual assault and rape; it released millions of dollars to fund research regarding both sexual violence and how to better treat the psychosocial and mental health problems of survivors.[7]
As rape was increasingly demonstrated to be a societal problem by the anti-rape movement, women worked together in feminist grassroots organizations to start the first rape crisis centers. These first centers were largely formed by radical feminists, as "…the goal initially was not reform, but a total transformation of ideologies, power relationships, and the existing social structure," and they relied mostly on volunteers.[7] However, by 1979 there were more than 1,000 rape crisis centers across the US, and these centers had started to shift away from this feminist ideology to a more liberal approach seeking reform and connections with other agencies that could aid survivors.[7] Between 1979 and the mid-1980s, this shift toward a more liberal approach continued as rape crisis centers started to be both institutionalized and professionalized, acquiring state grant funding that enabled many centers to hire staff.[7]

1980s[edit]
Worldwide, legislative reform to protect (potential) victims of rape began to be adopted under pressure from the feminist movement and their sympathisers. Marital rape was increasingly criminalised, while marry-your-rapist laws were repealed one by one after 1980. The first such move came in Italy in 1981, over a decade after the bride kidnapping of Franca Viola. Her late 1960s case created national controversy, resulting in a gradual moral evolution against the custom of so-called "rehabilitating marriages", in which a survivor's "honour" was considered restored if she married her rapist.[14]

2010s[edit]
In 2011 Usha Vishwakarma helped found Red Brigade Trust in Lucknow, India, an organization that holds self-defense classes for women and helps spread awareness.[15]
In 2013, UNC Chapel Hill students Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino filed a complaint against the university with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, based on Title IX.[16] The Department of Education, as a result, launched an investigation into how the university handled sexual assault cases.[17]
In September 2014 Emma Sulkowicz, a senior visual arts student at Columbia University, began protesting what they describe as the university's mishandling of a complaint against a fellow student who allegedly raped them by carrying their dorm room mattress with them every day. The protest was a performance art piece for their senior thesis entitled Carry That Weight. The performance ended with Sulkowicz's graduation. Sulkowicz's protest was reported by major news outlets including New York Magazine, which featured a portrait of Sulkowicz with their mattress on the cover of its Sept. 22 issue.[18] In the cover article, Vanessa Grigoriadis described Sulkowicz as "the poster girl for the anti-rape movement".[19] Sulkowicz inspired the formation of Carrying the Weight Together, "a coalition of college students and activists who are working to support survivors of sexual and domestic violence".[20] The group organized the Carry That Weight Day of Action, which involved 130 anti-sexual violence demonstrations held across the United States.[21]
In October 2017, following allegations of sexual assault against film producer Harvey Weinstein, the Me Too movement began to spread virally on social media after a Tweet by actress Alyssa Milano. The movement is a demonstration of solidarity and awareness among survivors of sexual assault.[22]

Legislation[edit]
See also: Marital rape laws by country
Common law[edit]
Rape, under common law, was initially defined as "the unlawful carnal knowledge of another person, and the elements of force and resistance were determinative."[23]  The common law definition of rape was used for many years and it was interpreted in different ways by each state.  Under common law, it was often the case that in rape trials, the victim felt that they were the one on trial due to the deep interrogation into their background.[24]  It was also part of the law that a husband could not be accused of raping his wife based on marital exemption.[25]  According to common law, it was required that the claimant could prove that they resisted, that the complaint was prompt, and proof that they did not consent.[26]  Also, part of the common law was the doctrine of prompt complaint.  The doctrine of prompt complaint required that the victims report their claim to the community and to police promptly following the attack in order to be considered legitimate.  Lawmakers felt that it made sense for the victim to want to report the case as soon as possible in hopes of finding the assailant. Unfortunately, not much was known about the psychological effects following an attack and rape trauma syndrome which changes one's behaviors.[26] The Doctrine of Prompt Complaint was actually considered one of the top three criteria for convicting a defendant of rape according to jurors.[26]  Prior to the anti-rape movement, the laws in the legal system did not place much legitimization on the claims of the victims, making them hesitant to even consider reporting a rape.[24]

Role of women[edit]
The anti-rape movement began by women breaking the silence on the issues of rape and the damages incurred as a result.[24]  The feminist movement first began to take notice of the low levels of rape convictions, especially in New York, and realized that rape was not taken seriously in the court of law from the victim's side. The movement then began to fight not only for rape law reform, but in many cases it was fighting for the repeal and revision of such laws.[27] In New York in 1971, one of the strictest states on rape claims, their law forced victims to provide evidence for force, penetration, and identity of the perpetrator all before the case could even go to trial.  These harsh guidelines and requirements made women feel unsafe in their own neighborhoods, in their own homes, and out on the streets.  It was groups such as the Women for a Free Future that spoke out for law reforms to protect women and their rights.[27]  Part of the movement was aided by the increasing numbers of women involved in law.  In the late 1960s, women made up for only 3% of the total number of lawyers in the United States.  Gradually, more and more women began entering law school and bringing their feminist ideals with them.[27]  More and more women's groups became involved in the fight not to change laws, but to repeal them. The Feminist Anti-Rape Squad planned a meeting in 1972 to discuss what measures would express to lawmakers that they wanted the laws to be repealed.  In 1973, the Women's Anti-Rape Coalition started a campaign through media and legislation to bring attention to the problems within the law.[27]  Later in 1973, joint committee hearings were held to begin to discuss the possibility of repeal, but the Legal Aid Society kept the existing laws in place.[27]

Beginning of changes[edit]
There were not any major changes in rape law legislation until the American Law Institute (ALI) drafted the Moral Penal Code (MPC) in 1955, but it was not until 1980 when the code was published.  Following its publication, many states became influenced to make some changes to their laws, with the biggest change being the redefinition of "rape".[27]  Although the MPC added "forced anal penetration" to the definition of rape, it still required the prompt complaint provision.[27]  It is notable that the MPC's Criminal Law Advisory Board, which determined these laws, included only one female member (Florence M. Kelly).[27]

Rape shield laws[edit]
One of the more important introductions to rape laws was the addition of rape shield laws. In California, the trial of People v. Plotkin used the complainant's sexual history to place doubt into the jurors' minds on the credibility of her claims.[27] Assault on credibility was a common tactic used in rape trials. Such investigation of the sexual background of complainants made them reluctant to go to trial.  The enactment of rape shield laws helped to provide further protection for rape victims during trial. These laws were created to restrict the past sexual history of the victim from being used against them during the trial.[24] These laws were proposed because it was feared that jurors would judge a complainant based on their history and use that for judgment on their current credibility and moral character. Eventually, President Jimmy Carter signed the legislation that allowed rape shield laws to be put into place to protect the victim. Also, the acknowledgement of rape trauma syndrome (RTS) helped jurors to gain an understanding of the actions of complainants following rape. RTS describes post-rape behavior that may include not reporting the rape promptly and many other psychological and emotional damage that resulted.[26]

Changes in law[edit]
Changes to state laws began when the bill that would remove the requirement of corroboration was repealed in Congress unanimously.  Following a national conference in 1973, changes began to take place more rapidly beginning with the creation of the National Rape Task Force (NOWRTF) which was a subgroup of the National Organization for Women (NOW).  The next step for activists was to create a sample of how they thought rape laws should be written.  One of the most successful repeal attempts took place in Michigan in 1974.  Michigan created the Criminal Sexual Conduct Law bill which removed spousal exception, lowered evidentiary burdens, redefined rape, and other reforms.[27]  On the other hand, Georgia had not repealed its law of spousal exemption until 1996, although most states had repealed theirs earlier in the 1990s. By 1980, all of the states had made, or at least considered making some changes.  The example set by Michigan highly encouraged all other states to take action against rape.  By 1980, there were over 400 rape crisis centers in the United States and laws had been changed to give the victim more leverage and voice during trials.  As rape crisis center reforms increased and picked up supporters, as did the rape law reform groups.[27]
The four main changes made to most state laws were:

The definition of rape changed. Changes to the definition of rape allowed for the possibility of a male being the victim of rape. The revised definition considered rape to include forced sexual contact in terms of vaginal, anal, or oral sex.
The requirement that the victim resists the assailant was eliminated. This protected women with disabilities since many are not physically able to ward off an assailant.[24]
The requirement that a third party corroborates the claim of rape was eliminated.
Rape Shield Laws were implemented.[28]
The new federal definition of rape is defined as, "non-consensual sexual intercourse 'by force, threat, or intimidation.'"[23] Federal law has divided rape into two categories: the common law rape of an adult and statutory rape which is assaulting a minor. According to federal law, the marital exemption does not exist.[23]
In the Middle East, the Campaign Against Lebanese Rape Law - Article 522 was launched in December 2016 in order to abolish the article that permitted Lebanese rapists to escape prosecution if they married the victim.

Concerns[edit]
Lawmakers and the public alike had some initial concerns about changing rape laws.  One of the biggest fears was that by changing the law, more accusations would arise and that wrongful convictions would be made.  Another concern was that by providing women with more control during the trial, they might become overwhelmed in the process and end up dropping the case even though a conviction may have been possible.  As of now, evidence has shown that there has only been a slight increase in the number of accusations, but for the most part, the probability of coming to a conviction has remained relatively stable. One of the biggest changes is that the penalties are harsher now than they have been historically.[24]

Rape crisis centers[edit]
Main article: Rape crisis centers in the United States
The anti-rape movement sets up rape crisis centers which seek to influence in their respective communities. These centers seek to connect with all groups of people and make their services accessible to the public and to particular minority groups who may have an increased risk of experiencing difficulty in accessing medical and other basic needs.

Education[edit]
Rape crisis centres offer education and outreach programs and workshops to the public, largely to prevent sexual assault from occurring. They cater their programs and workshops towards schools, community organizations, churches, and clubs,[29] and increase awareness of the commonality of sexual assault, how to recognize it, which assertive steps to take in order to reduce the risk of experiencing it, and knowing about local resources and options in the event that one experiences sexual assault. Educational outreach programs are designed for specific age groups ranging from children to adults.
Educational programs with the goal of preventing sexual violence through education and awareness can be introduced to children at an early age.  Kindergarten to second grade aged children are taught to identify 'good' and 'bad' forms of touch, and how to respond to unwanted forms of touch.[30]  Older elementary school-aged children are presented with strategies of how to say "no" to inappropriate conduct.[30]  The information is presented to the students in an age-appropriate fashion, such as through hand puppets or videos.[31]
Middle and high school-aged students learn through video and discuss how to distinguish healthy relationships from harmful ones, and what constitutes sexual harassment, even within a relationship.[30]  Students are taught about the three forms of sexual harassment (physical, visual and verbal), and that rape is about power and control rather than sex.[32]  High school students learn the definition of consent while examining different kinds of rape: stranger rape, date/acquaintance rape, and statutory rape.[33]
Adult programs incorporate a wide variety of information into their curricula.  Some common programs inform attendees about the local rape crisis centers, discuss the definition of date rape, explore how a sexual assault survivor is affected in terms of their religious beliefs, and provide steps that parents can take to keep their children safe from sexual violation.[34]  Other programs focus on media violence, the laws concerning sexual violence, and victim empathy and blaming.[35]  Many centers have a program related to substance abuse or date rape drugs.[36]
Sexual violence prevention is not the only focal point of rape crisis center education programs.  Programs and groups are also established for those who have experienced sexual assault.  These support groups are usually divided by sex or gender and are designed to create a safe atmosphere for sharing and listening.  Groups for survivors can explore self-esteem, assertiveness and healing.[37]  These groups may also examine emotional and psychological issues that can arise with the experience of sexual violence.  Emotional and psychological focal points include fear, self-doubt, guilt, anger, shame, self-blame, or denial.[38]  Selective rape crisis centers offer programs for couples who seek to actively end abuse within their relationship.[37]
Many rape crisis centers offer self-defense classes for girls and women.  Rape crisis centers who host these classes offer them at a regular interval for a minimum charge. Awareness, assertiveness, and physical technique are three basic keys to self-protection.[36]  Awareness involves assessing one's surroundings and situations to determine potential levels of safety or threat.  Students of the class are taught to use their body language and voice to assert their awareness and self-protection in ways that would discourage potential attackers.  The physical techniques used for self-defense incorporate martial arts methods of defense.[36]

Outreach and awareness[edit]
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, in which rape crisis centers host community events.  Rape crisis centers host events to promote advocacy, awareness, and empowerment to sexual assault survivors and others who are interested in sexual assault prevention.  These events are often creative in expressions, such as Shout Out Against Violence!, during which survivors of sexual assault and their allies can read performance pieces in an open-mic style evening of stories and thoughts related to sexual violence.[39]  Rape crisis centers sometimes use the month of April to work within the county schools. The Alachua County Victim Services & Rape Crisis Center, for example, holds a "Respect Your Date" contest in the county high schools during the first week of April.[40]
Special events unique to their respective communities are hosted by rape crisis centers nationwide.  Creativity and the arts are used as an effective method of local advocacy and awareness through these diverse events.  The rape crisis center in Santa Barbara, California, hosts a radio show six times a year to openly discuss issues concerning sexual and domestic violence, child abuse, and other forms of oppression.[41]  The Orange County Rape Crisis Center has developed a conference in Spanish called "Speaking the Forbidden: A Conference about Sexual Health, Mental Health, and Human Rights".[39]  The rape crisis center in DeKalb, Georgia, uses the Clothesline Project to increase awareness of sexual violence. In the Clothesline Project, female survivors of sexual assault create T-shirts that express their feelings on sexual violence.  This artistic project is permanently displayed at the DeKalb Rape Crisis Center.[42]  Cleveland County Rape Crisis Center in Ohio hosts "'Girls Kick Butt': An Empowerment Conference Model for Adolescent Girls".  "Girls Kick Butt" teaches empowerment by guiding girls and young women to choose healthy behaviors.[43]  Participants learn how to lessen the chance of sexual assault, and engage in activities that encourage building self-esteem.[43]  The Rape Crisis Center of South Dakota has held performances including The Vagina Monologues and A Long Walk Home, which delves into the area of women of color and rape.[44]
One myth that rape crisis centers work against is that rape and sexual violence is solely a women's issue.  In response to a societal mentality that rape revolved around female victims, organizations such as rape crisis centers established programs that focused on the dynamic that males were the ones overwhelmingly committing the crime of rape.  Such groups seek to change the male mentality into one that acknowledges their power to stop rape.  One subgroup that works through some rape crisis centers is the organization "Men Can Stop Rape", which targets young men in reforming their ideas about masculinity, strength, and violence.  Men are empowered by their dedication to a non-violent lifestyle as an ally to women.[45] The organization has made extensive use of posters and other social marketing tools.[46] "Men Can Stop Rape" is a nonprofit organization from Washington, D.C.  The organization uses their theme "My Strength is Not for Hurting" to promote their Rape Prevention Education program, which emphasizes building healthy relationships.[47]  With the assistance of local rape crisis centers, "Men Can Stop Rape" clubs have been established at several high schools located in California.[47]  Another group that works against rape and sexual violence, focusing more on research-based approaches to prevention, is One in Four.[48]  One in Four has chapters of its organization on college campuses and military bases across the United States and focuses its approach on building survivor empathy and bystander intervention.[49]
Rape crisis centers seek to ensure the best care for their patients by striving to be inclusive in their outreach programs to all groups of people.  Centers acknowledge how sexual assault might be experienced by different people and different groups of people.  Men, members of the LGBT community, sex workers, the homeless, Latinas, low-income people, people who are physically disabled, and non-native English speakers can attend groups specific to their needs through many crisis centers.[50] Although the last few decades have seen a rise in awareness concerning these issues of sexual violence, some anti-rape programs are facing cuts,[51] and anti-rape advocates worry that a movement that had much steam is in danger of losing preeminence in the public eye. [citation needed]

Societal criticism by the anti-rape movement in America[edit]
Because feminists and anti-rape advocates have varying perspectives on rape, they also have different views on the main challenges and opposition facing the anti-rape movement.[citation needed]
While radical feminist views are often attacked (by non-feminists and equity feminists[52] among many others) a more accepted theme in feminist and anti-rape literature is that of the prevalence of "rape culture". This concept is phrased by Marilyn French, who wrote, "The media treat male assaults on women like rape, beating, and murder of wives and female lovers, or male incest with children, as individual aberrations...obscuring the fact that all male violence toward women is part of a concerted campaign."[53] Other feminists and anti-rape advocates take a different approach to what constitutes "rape culture", focusing less on ideas like French's "concerted campaign" in which all males are complicit and more on what they see as institutional problems in American society. They point out sociocultural conditioning from childhood on that rears boys to be susceptible to becoming rapists and girls to accept victimization.[54] These problems include the theological and social beliefs of the Christian Right (and other conservative religious groups),[55] the handling of rape victims by police, by the medical industry, by the courts and judges, and the problem of the acceptance of pornography[56] and attitudes to women in American society.[citation needed]

Criticisms of the police[edit]
Many feminists and anti-rape advocates see a systemic problem with the way rape is handled immediately after it is reported to police. Advocates in Rape Crisis Centers report that very often police are the first hurdle many rape victims have to deal with right after a sexual assault occurs. The Ann Arbor Women's Center, a particularly active advocacy center founded in 1971, sees the societal problems that shape males in American culture as manifesting themselves hideously when rape victims report to often all-male police forces, writing in Freedom from Rape that:


Police officers, by and large, are male. Their views, like those of other men, have been shaped by the society in which they live. It is quite possible that a policeman was raised in a typical American home, he developed a value system that typifies women as gentle, quiet, and sweet. He probably believes that women would do best to stay at home in the evening unless accompanied by a husband or proper escort.[57]


In Freedom from Rape, the Ann Arbor Women's Center goes on to argue that such prejudiced police officers (conscious or such prejudice or not) make value judgments about women who report the rape as occurring under circumstances that could be judged by some as morally dubious or practically imprudent (i.e., leaving a bar alone late at night or walking home alone at night).  If the woman comes across as "outspoken, independent, and/or 'promiscuous'" she may be judged as a "that kind" of girl who was, in reality, "asking" to be raped.[57] Nancy Gager and Cathleen Schurr argue in Sexual Assault: Confronting Rape in America that such responses from law enforcement were indeed commonplace.[57]
Another deep problem many feminists and anti-rape activists see with law enforcement is an inability to understand the true nature of rape. Because of their maleness, Gager and Schurr proclaim that "Few policemen have any understanding of the complexity of emotions felt by rape victims, just as they have little understanding of women in general."[58] Many feminists also feel that policemen (indeed most men) fail to recognize what they see as a basic truth about rape – that it is about power and not sex, "an act of terror", not of lust.[58]
Whether the police even believe the rape victim's story or seek to report the incident are another matter, and one in which many rape victims report difficulties and inconsistencies. Feminists and anti-rape activists often highlight systemic problems with the way police handle interviewing and questioning victims. "Victims report being leered at, humiliated, and harassed by the policemen they called for help. To many women, the police often seem more interested in explicit sexual details than in catching the rapist."[59] In Gager and Schurr's study, they argue that some (though definitely not all) police show "rape victims the same inhumanity shown by the rapists themselves."[59] A rape crisis center worker reported that the police often turn a blind eye to rape if it is committed by a boyfriend or fiancée, often seeing such instances as a "lover's quarrel" and preferring not to get involved.[59] Another problem is that rape can be more difficult to prove when the victim is not physically assaulted, and this problem is compounded by what many Rape Crisis Centers see as the police's disinclination to believe women who were not outwardly harmed. Michigan's Rape Crisis Center observes that "Police go on the assumption that it didn't really happen if a woman is not noticeably physically injured."[59] This can present unique problems for women, especially if the experience was traumatic and she has trouble recalling specific details, which some police misinterpret as dishonesty rather than genuine trauma.[citation needed]
While feminists and rape crisis center workers acknowledge the honorable work some police officers do to combat rapists and be advocates for victims, they also argue that there are some categorical problems with the way law enforcement officers conceive of rape and deal with rape victims. While the Gager and Schurr study was conducted in the 1970s, current anti-rape sentiment (2007) still insists there are deep problems with the way police and courts handle rape victims and rape accusations. "Rape Victims Failed by Police and Courts"

Criticism of the legal system[edit]
There are many problems that feminists and rape crisis center workers have identified regarding the treatment of rape victims once the situation gets past the police and into court. Patricia Yancey Martin, in her book Rape Work: Victims, Gender, and Emotions in Organization and Community Context identifies many of these dilemmas, working to prove the thesis that "Police, prosecutors, and judges collaborate with rapists and their defenders."[60] Martin bases her thesis on a 1993 book by former rape prosecutor Alice Vachss, who explains how her experiences led her to believe that, for a multitude of reasons, "prosecutors and judges 'collaborate' with defense attorneys and rapists to let rapists off the hook."[61] Vachss laments that far too often rape crisis become more of a "chess match" between competing lawyers (or the state) than any attempt to provide justice or healing for the victim.[61]
One of the most pervasive problems identified by anti-rape advocates is the tactless, noncommittal, and ginger way that many prosecutors handle rape cases. An assistant prosecutor of rapists relates that many lawyers who become involved with rape cases have little training, sensitivity, and experience in dealing with the issue, and are disturbed by the issue and the details. Reporting anonymously, the 35-year-old man relates that many of his colleagues are "convinced through the years of prosecution folklore that rape cases can't be won … so they plead 'em and settle cheap."[60] The very nature of rape cases causes attorneys, many of whom are working for profit, to shy away. A 37-year-old Rape Crisis Center founder and executive director, also speaking anonymously, bemoaned the fact that accused rapists are difficult to convict which causes success-driven lawyers to instead seek out and fight hard for burglary or larceny cases, because there are "no emotional issues, no time-consuming efforts and victims."[61] In short, these types of cases are widely regarded in the legal world as "much easier to win".[61]
Catherine MacKinnon argues that a categorical mistake that legal officials make in prosecuting rape is framing the important question to be answered by the jury and debated by the lawyers is "Did the man have reason to believe [or convincingly say he believed] the woman (girl) consented to have sex?"[62] The question which should be asked is "Did the man use force to have sex with the woman (or girl) against her will?"[62] Thus, the defense attorney can simply seek to build a case that the rapist thought the woman or girl consented, rather than focusing on whether or not force or date-rape agents were used. MacKinnon argues this is a profoundly wrong way to frame cases, but one that is prevalent and is sympathetic to rapists, not victims.[citation needed]
By the very nature of the American legal system, good cases with strong evidence have to be built in order for prosecuting attorneys to pursue them. While this may protect many innocent individuals accused of other crimes, very often it can shelter rapists, since courts are apt to err on the side of acquittal in a "his word versus hers" situation.[citation needed] In the opinion of many feminists and rape crisis center workers, courts and legal authorities unfairly portray rape victims as emotionally unstable, morally dubious, unpredictable, and erratic.[63] Instead of assuming the victim is telling the truth and seeking healing and justice, rape victims are often attacked for their background (i.e., being prostitutes, heavy drinkers, or often sexually active) and assumed to be "probable liars".[64] Advocates for rape victims point out that no matter what a woman's sexual history is, no one asks to be raped, and no one's choices, whatever their moral worth, destroy the necessity of their consent to engage in any sexual acts.

Our Mother of Sorrows Monastery and Retreat Center is an historic Passionist monastery at 110 Monastery Avenue in West Springfield, Massachusetts.  The Spanish Colonial Revival building on the campus (construction begun in 1925) is the only structure of its type in the city, was the first monastery established in western Massachusetts.  It was enlarged in 1955, and served as a Roman Catholic monastery, retreat, and outreach center until 1993.  It has since been converted into a senior living facility, and was listed on the  National Register of Historic Places in 2002.[1]


Description and history[edit]
The former Our Mother of Sorrows Monastery and Retreat Center is located in a residential area north of downtown West Springfield, on more than 18 acres (7.3 ha) of landscaped grounds on the north side of Monastery Street.  The main building is a large five-section masonry structure with Spanish Colonial Revival styling.  It has a steel frame, and its exterior is finished in brick and ashlar granite.  First-floor window and door openings generally have rounded arches, while upper-floor windows are sash set in rectangular openings.  It is covered by a red tile hip roof.  Three of the five wings have more elaborate styling; these are the oldest section of the building, while the left wings, which give the building a general C shape, were added in 1955.[2]
The Passionist Order is a Roman Catholic fraternity founded in 1720 in what is now Italy.  By the early 19th century, it had spread to English-speaking countries, and by 1852 it had reached the United States.  The Catholic population of Massachusetts, small in the early 19th century, grew substantially due to immigration from Ireland and Quebec.  The first Passionist monastery was established in Boston, and in 1922 members of the order proposed establishing one in western Massachusetts.  This property was built in 1923 to a design by John T. Comes of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who had designed a retreat for the Passionists there.  The building is the largest example of Spanish colonial architecture in the region.[2]
The monastery performed three principal functions during its period of operation (1923-1993).  It provided a place for the contemplative life of order members, who followed rigidly prescribed patterns of life focused on work and prayer.  It provided a retreat space for priests engaged in outreach throughout the region, and as a training ground for future priests and monks.  In its later years it expanded to offer weekend retreats to lay people as well.  The monastery operated as a nearly self-sufficient entity, raising most of its own food on garden plots on the grounds, and also housed a small infirmary where sick members not requiring hospitalization could be treated.[2]
The popularity of its retreat offerings declined in the second half of the 20th century, and the monastery population also began to shrink and age.  In 1990, the facility opened its doors as an elder housing facility operated by the order, but was then shut down in 1993, its religious functions dispersed to other locations.  The building subsequently underwent a certified historic rehabilitation, and now functions as an assisted living facility.[2]

For the U.S. Army General and nurse, see Hazel Johnson-Brown.
Hazel Angela Brown (31 January 1942 – 22 September 2022) was a Trinbagonian women's and consumer rights activist. She was a co-founder and coordinator of the Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women. She was secretary general of the Commonwealth Women's Network.


Early life[edit]
Hazel Browne was born on 31 January 1942 in East Dry River, Belmont, Port of Spain, to Una Browne and Carlis Browne. She attended Gloster Lodge Moravian Primary School and received a scholarship to study at Bishop Anstey High School. She also attended St. Joseph's Convent in San Fernando.[1][2]
Brown graduated from Cipriani Labour College in 1969;[3] she was one of the first students to graduate from the school.[1]

Career[edit]
Brown was involved with community organisation projects, research, and social development as early as 1969. She focussed on gender equality, consumers' rights, and the elimination of poverty.[4]
Brown was a crucial figure in the development of the Housewives Association of Trinidad and Tobago (HATT), an organisation promoting consumer rights awareness which was founded in 1971. The work of HATT led to the establishment of the Trinidad and Tobago Bureau of Standards in 1974.[2][1] She was also a co-founder of the Telephone Users Group in 1971. Through the group, utility customers participated in hearings over utility rates that resulted in changes to the rate structures of electricity and water.[2]
In 1976, Brown made an unsuccessful bid as an independent candidate for the Port of Spain East seat in the House of Representatives.[2]
Brown and 13 others founded the Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women in 1985, an umbrella organisation for non-governmental organisations that focus on women's issues.[5] It was formed to present the position of women in Trinidad and Tobago at the 1985 World Conference on Women in Nairobi.[3]
In 1987 Brown said that the outlook for women under the National Alliance for Reconstruction and then-Prime Minister A. N. R. Robinson was "bleak and dangerous", stating that "there is a lot of lip service being paid to the idea of the upliftment of women in the society but that is all. Mr. Robinson is the problem because there is a gap between his stated position on issues, including women, and his actions. But the whole change process will not work unless there is proper participation by women."[6] Along with Grace Talma, she challenged the government's Policy Statement on Women which was approved by the cabinet in 1987. In response to the policy statement, she and other women's NGOs drafted a National Paper on the Status of Women in 1990.[7]
Brown coordinated the participation of Trinidadian and Tobagonian NGOs in United Nations conferences. She was the coordinator for the Caribbean Region Preparatory Process Project of the 1995 World Summit for Social Development conference. She was responsible for the participation of NGOs at the 1995 Beijing UN Women's Conference[3] and was part of the negotiation sessions for the Beijing Platform for Action.[8] She worked organising women for political office with EMILY's List.[9] Brown led the Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women's 'Put a Woman' project during the 2000 and 2001 elections, which encouraged people to vote for women candidates.[1]
In 2006, she became coordinator for the Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women.[1]
Brown endorsed Kamla Persad-Bissessar for the 2010 campaign for Prime Minister.[10]
Brown served as Secretary General of the Commonwealth Women's Network and was a special envoy for women and girls with the Ministry of Gender, Youth and Child Development.[4] In 2011 she was appointed to Commonwealth Caribbean as a special envoy on women and children's issues.[4] She also advocated on behalf of adopting a National Gender Policy and served as a member of the Draft Gender Policy committee.[4][2] She took part in panel discussions and training seminars with the Women's Arm of the United National Congress.[8]
Brown served on the boards of the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, the Trinidad and Tobago Agribusiness Association, and the Diego Martin Consumer Cooperative Society.[4]
Brown advocated on behalf of economic opportunities for HIV-positive women.[2] Since 1992, she promoted the use of solar box cookers as an affordable and environmentally friendly way to prepare food.[3][2]

Awards and honours[edit]
In 2011, Brown received the Medal for the Development of Women (Gold) for advancing women's rights in Trinidad and Tobago.[2]
In March 2015, a conference was held honouring her achievements titled Fearless Politics: The Life and Times of Hazel Brown. The Network of NGOs for the Advancement of Women donated a collection of Brown's documents to the Alma Jordan Library of the University of the West Indies, establishing the Hazel Brown Special Collection.[4][11]
In 2017 she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) by the University of the West Indies at St. Augustine for "her untiring work in women's development, consumer rights and poverty eradication".[2] St. Joseph's Convent inducted her into its Past Pupils' Hall of Excellence in November 2019.[4]

Personal life[edit]
Hazel married Herman Brown at the age of 20. They had three children—Leah, Carla and Garvin. Brown's husband died when the children were young.[2][12] 
Her youngest child Natasha, with father Philip C. Nunez, was born in 1974. 
Brown was diagnosed with cancer in the 1990s.[4][3] She became an advocate for cancer survivors and was honoured by the Guyana Cancer Society.[1] Towards the end of her life, she also had Parkinson's disease and diabetes.[8]
Brown died at the age of 80 on 22 September 2022 at her home in Diamond Vale, Diego Martin. She was interred at Lapeyrouse Cemetery.[5][12]

Punk's Dead (also known as Punk's Dead: SLC Punk 2) is a 2016 American comedy-drama film written and directed by James Merendino. It is a sequel to the 1998 film SLC Punk! and was released on February 11, 2016.
Set 19 years after the events of the first film, the plot deals with unresolved conflict and family strain, and also has elements of a coming-of-age story. Michael Goorjian reprises his role of Heroin Bob; acting as a narrator for the film, both in voice-over as well as sporadically intercut scenes of him in the afterlife.


Plot[edit]
Ross is the child of Trish and Heroin Bob, having been conceived shortly before Bob's drug overdose. He has been raised alone by Trish, above her steam punk curio and clothing boutique. As a result of his mother's adoration of the macabre, as well as his immersion in the concept of death from a young age (his father's), he develops into a Victorian Goth. Despite his obvious affiliation, Ross insists that he is part of no social cliques, which is stressed even further when he states that despite a lifelong abstinence from drugs, alcohol, and sex he is not Straight Edge either.
Upon having his heart broken by his first girlfriend, Ross attempts to drown his sorrows, as well as his lifelong espousal that romantic love is trivial, with the aide of beer and liquor. In an attempt to further help him take his mind off of things, he also begrudgingly goes on a road trip to a punk rock concert with his only friend, Crash, as well as Crash's friend Penny. Ross has a low opinion of punks, despite his association with them, as Crash and Penny are punk rockers like his father.
As Ross is on the road with Crash and Penny, the situation is made known to Trish by Crash's mother. After being told that her only son was being extremely emotional and went to get drunk with Crash and go to a punk show, Trish becomes consumed with genuine concern for her son. She also has overwhelming anxiety, being that the last time she saw Bob alive, he was crying and drunk. Bob also notes distress from the afterlife by pointing out that alcoholism runs in the men in his family, and it's never turned out well for any of them.
Trish calls around to see if anyone has seen Ross and ultimately enlists the help of John and Sean, former friends of his Bob's, to help find him. In the 19 years that have transpired, both men have changed drastically from the first film. John has become the frontman of a black metal band as well as owning a black metal record store. He also no longer goes by the nickname of "John the Mod", instead going by his stage name of Johnny Jackyll. Sean voluntarily checked himself into a psychiatric rehabilitation center after the events of the first film left him homeless and psychologically fractured as a result of his drug use and has amazingly come into the employment of a Utah state senator since his release, though still retaining his punk mentality and love of punk music.
After some debate as to where Ross may have gone, Sean leads them in the direction of the concert that he believes they may be going to, and they are picked up by Eddy, another of Bob's old friends. Tensions flare between Sean and Eddy en route concerning the latter's profession. Eddy has become the proprietor of a very successful strip club as well as owning and operating a "tease" website, that is modeled after Suicide Girls. Sean accuses Eddy of being a parasite who exploits women for profit and says he is no different than a common pimp.
Along the way to the show, Ross is made aware of his outwardly callous and pompous attitude towards others by Penny, which unsettles him, and he decides to change. He spots a man by the side of the road and has Penny pull over to offer him a ride, showing a consideration for others. They approach the man, a Rastafarian named William, who accepts their offer and proceeds to tell them that he is standing there as a result of a "pick up.” As Ross is preoccupied, William opens his backpack and reveals to Crash and Penny several pounds of hallucinogenic mushrooms within. Ross approaches, and a combination of hunger, drunkenness, and complete ignorance of drugs leads him to grab a large handful and consume them before anyone can stop him. William assures an immediately alarmed Crash and Penny that "Him won't die, but him will fly!”They proceed to head down the road as the mushrooms kick into gear for Ross, Crash, and William. Penny begrudgingly abstained so she could drive.
Later in the day, Ross is roused from his drug-induced sleep by Crash as they are parked at a gas station. William has departed before Ross comes to, and he regrets not saying goodbye to him. As the three are talking, a voice shouts to them, and Penny snaps her head around to see her father who has stopped for gas. After a violent encounter ensues between the two, Penny destroys her father's truck and exposes his sexual abuse of her. The three then speed off without further incident.
Finally reaching the concert, Ross, who is still under the influence of mushrooms and alcohol, lets his inhibitions go; he joins Crash in the slam pit and interacts socially with the other punks in attendance. He continues to ride his feelings of excitation and decides to act on them by approaching Penny, who he has been growing feelings for, to ask her out. With her previous revelation of abuse, which has led to her own failures in otherwise healthy relationships, she rejects the possibility of anything happening between them. She sees Ross' true worth and affirms that if she were to let herself, she would fall in love with him, which scares her. As Ross is crushed but understanding, Penny rethinks her choice and kisses him passionately as Crash approaches excitedly to see his two friends both happy.
In his euphoria, Ross climbs onto the stage during Extreme Corporal Punishment's set, and after grabbing the microphone, tries to convey to the annoyed crowd that he loves all of them despite their differences. However, his attempt at unity comes out as an unintentional insult regarding his perceived redundancy and materialism of punk rock and punks in general, and he is pulled off the stage and attacked by the crowd. As Crash and Penny do their best to help Ross, John and Sean arrive and run to their aide, and they are successful in getting Ross outside where Trish and the others are waiting.
Ross and his mother have a confrontation wherein she demands to know why he is making such irregular and reckless decisions. Ross assures her that everything is alright and that he finally knows who he is. She rejects this and pushes further, comparing his actions to his father's, which spurs Ross to angrily disparage his father, causing Trish to slap him. Ross walks away with Penny and Crash after telling his mother that he is moving out.  Sean intercedes and quells the situation by telling Trish that she has been overbearing on Ross his whole life, out of a fear of losing him like she lost Bob and has never let him be a kid. She has unknowingly forced Ross to fill his father's shoes in a sense, and he has never really been free to develop on his own. He alludes to the fact that it is her own post traumatic stress disorder that has led to a great deal of the conflict in that she has never been able to let Bob go and move on with her life. She resists but breaks down and admits that she wants to let Bob go, but she can't because he left her alone with Ross and broke her heart. Ross approaches, embraces his mother, and their relationship is repaired.
Bob ends the film by stating that even though everyone is letting go, moving on and living life, in the end, he's still dead, "So, fuck you!"

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
In April 2013, director James Merendino announced that a sequel to SLC Punk! titled Punk's Dead would begin filming later in the year and would be released in 2014 with most of the original cast reprising their roles.  One scene of the film was successfully funded by an Indiegogo campaign for publicity launched on October 27, 2013, and completed on January 15, 2014.[5] Merendino said of the sequel, "I made SLC Punk! when I was a kid, and accordingly, the story is naive, and, as just a coming of age story, not finished. The characters are facing big questions, 18 years later, as outsiders, punk rockers… What relevance do they have in a world where all statements have already been made? In the years since I made SLC Punk!, it has found a rather large and supportive following who have been very kind to me. So in making a sequel, I feel I owe it to those people to really do it right."[6] Also in April, Jenny Jaffe confirmed she was cast in the film as Shelly.[2]

Casting[edit]
In May 2014, the film was announced to be shooting in June, with its cast officially announced to include Devon Sawa, Michael A. Goorjian, Adam Pascal and James Duval returning as Sean, Heroin Bob, Eddie and John the Mod, respectively, with Ben Schnetzer appearing as Heroin Bob's son, Ross, Colson Baker as Crash, and Hannah Marks and Sarah Clarke will portray the female leads.[1] Also in May, Matthew Lillard, who starred in the original film announced that he would not be reprising his role from the first film  through social media.[7][8]

Filming[edit]
Filming commenced in June 2014 in Salt Lake City, Utah and concluded on June 21, 2014.[8][9][10] A trailer for the film was released in July 2014.[11] In May 2015, the film distribution rights were sold at the Cannes Film Market.[12][13]
The punk show that is portrayed in the film was an actual full length concert that was arranged specifically for filming, and took place on June 20, 2014, at The Complex, in downtown Salt Lake City. The bands that were featured on the bill, and appearing on screen are; Screeching Weasel, Ulteriors, Dog Party, Eight Bucks Experiment (as Extreme Corporal Punishment), as well as the Dwarves, whose song "Let's Fuck!" is featured prominently in the film during the concert, as well as their song "Salt Lake City" being used in most promotional trailers. The Complex was also the location that was used for the Goth club where Ross meets Lillith.
Trish's fictional steam punk boutique, Dearly Departed, as well as John's record shop, Warrior Music, was filmed within Crone's Hollow, a store which sells religious goods and other items. The store is located at 3834 Main Street in South Salt Lake, although it's portrayed as being within Ogden, which is 40 miles north of Salt Lake City.
Bob's apartment scenes were filmed on location at the Utah Arts Alliance, an art collective building, located at 663 100 S., in Salt Lake City, down the street from the Clark Planetarium. The location of Bob's grave was filmed within Rotary Glen Park, located at 2903 Kennedy Drive in Salt Lake City.

Release[edit]
The film was released in one theater on February 11, 2016, at The Gateway in Salt Lake City. The film is available for digital download on February 16, 2016, and was released on home media on March 8, 2016.[14] The film had commenced streaming on Netflix on August 5, 2016.

Epistemicism is a position about vagueness in the philosophy of language or metaphysics, according to which there are facts about the boundaries of a vague predicate which we cannot possibly discover.  Given a vague predicate, such as 'is thin' or 'is bald', epistemicists hold that there is some sharp cutoff, dividing cases where a person, for example, is thin from those in which they are not.  As a result, a statement such as "Saul is thin" is either true or false. The statement does not, as other theories of vagueness might claim, lack a truth-value – even if the determinate truth-value is beyond our epistemological grasp.  Epistemicism gets its name because it holds that there is no semantic indeterminacy present in vague terms, only epistemic uncertainty.
Epistemicism was historically considered an untenable position, since it requires vague terms to possess extremely specific conditions of application.  Since the publication of Timothy Williamson's 1994 book, Vagueness, which defended the view, it has been taken seriously by many philosophers working in the area.

Lolita Ritmanis (born November 1, 1962) is a Latvian-American composer, known for her film and television scores, including her work on the animated series Batman Beyond.[1][2]


Early life[edit]
Born on November 1, 1962, in Portland, Oregon, Ritmanis is the daughter of Dr. Andris Ritmanis and Asja Ritmanis, who fled Latvia during World War II and immigrated to the US in 1949.[3] Ritmanis has a sister, Brigita Ritmanis-Jameson, and a brother, Alberts Ritmanis.
Throughout her childhood Ritmanis studied piano, flute, guitar, and voice, performing in both jazz and classical music ensembles. Ritmanis composed her first song at age 11. By age 16 she had toured the US, Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, composing for and performing with the Latvian popular music group "Dzintars" ("Amber"). Latvian song festivals throughout the world provided Ritmanis with the opportunity to conduct and perform her works before larger audiences.
Ritmanis graduated from Cleveland High School in Portland, Oregon in 1980. She moved to Los Angeles to study at the Dick Grove School Of Music, where she graduated from both the Composition Program and the Film Music Composition Program, studying with composers Dick Grove, Mundell Lowe, Lalo Schifrin, Henry Mancini, Allyn Ferguson, and Jack Feierman, among others. Ritmanis also studied privately with teachers Mauro Bruno, Gibner King, and Matt Dennis.

Career[edit]
Film and television composition[edit]
Upon completing her studies, Ritmanis began working at Warner Bros. and Walt Disney Studios,  which led to work in the field of orchestration for film and television. She was able to secure a steady supply of work from composers such as Michael Kamen, Basil Poledouris, Shirley Walker, Mark Snow, Paul Chihara, Bennett Salvay, Elliot Goldenthal, Louis Febre, Burt Bacharach, Snuffy Walden, and Carter Burwell. In 1991, with the help of composer Shirley Walker, Ritmanis began her career as a film and television composer. Her collaboration with Ms. Walker provided an opportunity for her to write music for Batman: The Animated Series at Warner Bros. Studios.  She continued at Warner Bros. with work on Superman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond. During this period of time, Ritmanis met and began a professional collaboration with composers Michael McCuistion and Kristopher Carter. The trio went on to compose music for The Zeta Project, Teen Titans, Justice League,  Justice League Unlimited, Legion of Super Heroes, and several long-form projects.
She has orchestrated over 100 films, mini-series, and television programs, including Lethal Weapon 4, The X-Files, Swimfan, Jeepers Creepers 2, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Final Destination, The West Wing, and Demolition Man. She also orchestrated the score, with McCuistion composing and conducting, for the Spider-Man 2 video game, which is based on the 2004 film of the same name. Ritmanis also orchestrated a portion of the closing ceremonies of the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta.

Concert works[edit]
Ritmanis's concert works have been and continue to be performed throughout the US, Canada, Europe, Taiwan, Latvia, and Australia. The symphonic poem Farewell To Riga was performed at Portland Civic Auditorium in 1982.  Her cantata A New Day was performed at Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center in 1986. In 1989 Tas vakars piektdienā (Same Time Next Friday), a musical, was performed at the Terrace Theatre in Long Beach, California and throughout Latvia in the summer of 1990. Turp un atpakaļ (There and back), a musical revue, was performed throughout the United States and Canada in 1999 and 2000. The musical Skudra un sienāzis (The Ant And The Grasshopper) was performed at the Latvian Song Festival in Thousand Oaks, California in 1999. In August 2003, the musical Gudrais padomiņš (Wise advice) was performed at Cathedral Hill in San Francisco. Rudentiņš pie durvīm klauvē (Autumn is Knocking on the Door), a work for choir and chamber orchestra, was performed at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco on August 8, 2003. In 2004, Eslingena, a musical, was performed at the Isabel Bader Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and in 2005 it was performed at the National Theatre in Riga, Latvia. In 2007 Ritmanis began work on a new musical, set to premiere in fall 2008 in Ventura, California.

Dynamic Music Partners[edit]
As of 2007, Ritmanis and her colleagues Michael McCuistion and Kristopher Carter formed the Dynamic Music Partners (DMP).[4] DMP has worked on the Warner Bros. series Legion of Super Heroes. In addition to their work in animation, DMP completed the score for the Thomas Callaway feature film Broke Sky, which premiered at the 2007 SXSW Film Festival.

Alliance for Women Film Composers[edit]
In 2014, Ritmanis co-founded the Alliance for Women Film Composers with Laura Karpman and Miriam Cutler.[5] The organization provides visibility and advocacy for women composers.[6]

Personal life[edit]
Ritmanis is married to music producer Mark Mattson. They live in Studio City, California, with their three children – Andris, Ilze and Aija. They maintain two recording studios.

Awards[edit]
Ritmanis was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 2007 in Music Direction and Composition category for her work on Legion Of Super Heroes.[7]  In 2002, she was nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Main Title Theme Music category for Justice League.[8] In 2021, Ritmanis received the Hollywood Music in Media Award in the category "Original Score — Independent Film (Foreign Language)"[9] and Society of Composers & Lyricists Award in the category "Outstanding Original Score for Independent Film" for her work in the 2019 Latvian film Blizzard of Souls.[10]

Licorice Pizza is a 2021 American romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. It stars Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman in their film debuts, alongside an ensemble supporting cast including Sean Penn, Tom Waits, Bradley Cooper, and Benny Safdie. Set in 1973, the film follows the relationship between a teen actor (Hoffman) and a directionless young woman (Haim).
The film was released in the United States in select theaters on November 26, 2021, followed by a wide release on December 25.[6] It was a box-office bomb, grossing $33 million worldwide against a $40 million production budget, but was acclaimed by critics and received three nominations at the 94th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, making it Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's first fully produced, marketed, and distributed film to be nominated for Best Picture since Rain Man in 1988.[7] Among its many other nominations and awards, it received three awards from the National Board of Review (including Best Film), was named one of the best films of 2021 by the American Film Institute, received four nominations at the 79th Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy), and won the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay.


Plot[edit]
In 1973 San Fernando Valley, 15-year-old actor Gary Valentine meets Alana Kane, a 25-year-old photographer's assistant, at his school picture day. She is put off by his invitation to dinner that evening, but shows up anyway.
When Gary's mother Anita cannot chaperone him on a press tour performance in New York City, he invites Alana to do it. Alana begins dating his co-star Lance, making Gary jealous, but they break up after Lance says he is an atheist during a Shabbat dinner with her Jewish family.
Gary begins selling waterbeds after coming across one at a wig shop and reconnects with Alana at a teenage trade expo. While at the expo, Gary is mistaken for a murder suspect and arrested on the spot, and Alana runs after him to the police station. He is soon released when the mix-up is sorted out. She joins his waterbed business, acting seductively on the phone to land a potential customer.
After introducing Alana to his talent agent, Gary is upset that she is open to nudity but refuses to show him her breasts. She impulsively does so, but slaps him when he asks to touch them. They open a "Fat Bernie's" storefront for their waterbeds and Alana is hurt when Gary flirts with his classmate Sue and later makes out with Sue in the back room. A jealous Alana peeks in on them before kissing a man on the street, then storming off.
Gary's agent secures Alana an audition for a film starring veteran actor Jack Holden, who brings her to the Tail o' the Cock restaurant, where Gary and his friends are also dining. An inebriated Alana makes Gary jealous, and Holden's friend, film director Rex Blau, convinces him to recreate one of his motorcycle stunts on a nearby golf course, bringing the entire restaurant along. Alana topples off the bike as Holden accelerates away to jump over a flaming sand trap, and Gary runs to her side. Reconciled, they walk to the waterbed store, where Gary stops himself from touching a sleeping Alana's breast.
The 1973 oil crisis sweeps the country, forcing the waterbed manufacturer to close. Alana, Gary, and his friends make one final delivery to the home of Jon Peters. As he leaves to meet his girlfriend, Barbra Streisand, Peters humiliates Gary, threatening to strangle his brother if Gary damages the house.
While setting up the waterbed in the master bedroom, Gary intentionally leaves the hose running while filling it, with Alana's approval. They drive away but are waved down by an agitated Peters, whose car has run out of gas. After driving him home to retrieve a gas canister, they take him to a crowded gas station, but leave him behind when he violently commandeers a gas pump. Gary stops to smash Peters's car, but then they run out of gas as well. Alana maneuvers the truck backwards down a long hill to a gas station, impressing Gary, but causing her to question her recent decisions.
Inspired by a campaign poster, Alana reaches out to her old classmate Brian, who brings her on as volunteer staffer for Joel Wachs, a city councilman running for mayor. Gary briefly joins her but overhears that pinball will soon be legalized in the Valley and decides to open an arcade, leading to an argument with Alana. They lash out at each other about their difference in age and their fraught relationship. Alana emasculates Gary in a verbally abusive volley in an attempt to make herself appear better than Gary, but, when Gary decides to leave, she offers to drive him in an attempt to make peace. Gary drives off alone.
Later, Gary prepares for the opening night of his arcade, remodeling his storefront into "Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace". That same night, Alana nearly shares a kiss with Brian, but is interrupted by an invitation to join Wachs at a restaurant. Thinking it is a date, when Alana arrives, she is dejected to discover that Wachs just wants her to pose as the girlfriend of his secret boyfriend, Matthew, to save him from political embarrassment.
Alana walks a deeply hurt Matthew home, and they commiserate over the men in their lives. She goes to the arcade to find Gary, who has left to look for her at Wachs's office, with her sisters' encouragement. Alana and Gary eventually cross paths and run to each other's arms. They return to the arcade, where Gary announces her as "Mrs. Alana Valentine". Sharing a kiss, they run into the night, and Alana tells Gary that she loves him.

Production[edit]
Development[edit]
Writer, director, and producer Paul Thomas Anderson
Around 2001, Anderson was walking by a middle school in Los Angeles on picture day. He observed one of the students nagging the female photographer and had an idea of the student having a romantic relationship with the photographer. The screenplay of Licorice Pizza evolved from this experience and additional stories told to Anderson by his friend Gary Goetzman, who was a child actor who had starred in the film Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, and eventually started a waterbed company and pinball arcade. Goetzman at one time delivered a waterbed to Jon Peters's home.[13][14] Anderson considered Fast Times at Ridgemont High and American Graffiti as major influences in the making of Licorice Pizza.[8]
Anderson received permission from Jon Peters to develop a character based on him, on the sole condition that Peters's favorite pick-up line was used, and Anderson went on to create a "monster version" of Peters based on 1970s Hollywood producers who had "a reputation for a lot of bravado and aggro energy."[8]
In September 2021, the film was officially titled Licorice Pizza,[15] named after a former chain of record shops in southern California.[16] Anderson explained: "If there's two words that make me kind of have a Pavlovian response and memory of being a child and running around, it's 'licorice' and 'pizza' [...] It instantly takes me back to that time." He added that the words "seemed like a catch-all for the feeling of the film [...] that go well together and maybe capture a mood."[8][14]

Casting[edit]
Haim plays the lead role of Alana Kane, in her film debut.
Anderson wrote the screenplay with Alana Haim in mind and offered her the lead role in summer 2019.[17] He has a close connection to her band Haim, having directed several of their music videos, and is a close friend of the Haim family.[18] Haim's sisters Este and Danielle and parents Mordechai and Donna were also cast to play her character's family.[19] Cooper Hoffman, the son of Philip Seymour Hoffman, was cast late in the process after Anderson found the auditioning young actors too "precocious" and "trained" to match the naturalistic style of Haim's acting.[18] Licorice Pizza marks the feature film debut of both Haim and Hoffman.[19][20] Described as a "family-and-friends project" by the Los Angeles Times, the film also features Anderson's longtime partner Maya Rudolph, their four children, and many of their neighborhood friends in various roles.[14]

Filming[edit]
Principal photography began in Encino, California, in August 2020,[21] under the working title Soggy Bottom[22] which, in the film, is the initial name of Gary's waterbed business. In November 2020, it was reported that principal photography had wrapped and post-production had begun.[23] A Tudor Revival manor previously owned by actor Lyle Waggoner was used for scenes at Jon Peters's house.[24] Tail o' the Cock, a local restaurant that was demolished in 1987, was recreated for the film at the Van Nuys Golf Course.[14][25] Haim spent a week learning to drive large trucks, and personally performed the stunt where her character backs the truck down a long hill.[17]
Anderson and Michael Bauman (sharing a director of photography credit) shot Licorice Pizza on 35 mm film, using older lenses in order to create the film's 1970s texture.[26]

Music[edit]
Main article: Licorice Pizza (soundtrack)
Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood composed the film's score cues. The first trailer for the film, which was released online on September 27, 2021, was set to David Bowie's "Life on Mars?",[27] which also is featured in the film.
The film's official soundtrack was released by Republic Records. Included are many of the period songs featured in the film, as well as one of the original tracks composed by Greenwood.[28]

Release[edit]
In December 2019, Focus Features, which had financed and released Anderson's previous film Phantom Thread, came on to produce and distribute the film.[29] However, in July 2020, it was reported that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had acquired the film's distribution rights from Focus, presumably due to budgetary issues, and that MGM would set a new start date due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[30]
The film was released in select theaters in the United States by United Artists Releasing on November 26, 2021, followed by a nationwide release on December 25. It was released in the United Kingdom on January 14, 2022, by Universal Pictures.[6][31]

Home media[edit]
Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released the film digitally on March 1, 2022, and on both Blu-ray and DVD on May 17.[32]

Reception[edit]
Box office[edit]
Licorice Pizza grossed $17.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $15.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide box office total of $33.2 million.[4][5] Deadline Hollywood reported the film lost money for the studio, though did note it "brought a pulse to arthouses during a downbeat time".[33]
The film opened in four theaters on November 26, 2021, including the Regency Village Theatre in Los Angeles. It made $335,000 its opening weekend, for an average of $83,800 per screen. Audiences were reported to be: 72% between the ages of 18 and 34; 66% male; and 70% Caucasian, 19% Latino and Hispanic, 8% Asian, and 3% Black. Close to 70% of the viewers were college graduates.[34][35]
Its fifth weekend, the film expanded to 786 theaters and entered the box office top ten for the first time with $1.9 million, finishing eighth. During the weekend, 66% of audience members were between the ages of 18 and 34.[36][37] The film made $1.3 million its sixth weekend,[38] $981,886 its seventh,[39] $879,511 its eighth,[40] $659,953 its ninth,[41] $630,117 its tenth,[42] and $644,699 its eleventh.[43]
After earning its three Academy Award nominations, the film was expanded to 1,977 total theaters and made $959,788 over its twelfth weekend, finishing ninth at the box office.[44] It dropped out of the top ten its thirteenth weekend of release, grossing $647,973.[45]

Critical response[edit]

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 91% of 317 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads: "Licorice Pizza finds Paul Thomas Anderson shifting into a surprisingly comfortable gear – and getting potentially star-making performances out of his fresh-faced leads."[46] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".[47] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 87% positive score, with 73% saying they would definitely recommend it.[48]
The film generated some controversy over the romance between the main characters, one of whom is 25 (or 28) and the other 15.[49] It also came under fire for scenes in which the character Jerry uses a demeaning mock Asian accent when speaking to his Japanese wives.[50] Regarding the latter, director Anderson defended the scenes as being contemporaneous and accurate portrayals of the movie's time period.[51] The group Media Action Network for Asian Americans, however, called for an awards boycott of the movie due to the decision to include these two scenes without any pushback from the characters.[50]
Licorice Pizza was nominated in three categories at the 94th Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay), and in four at the 79th Golden Globe Awards (Best Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Musical or Comedy, and Best Screenplay). It was ranked second on Cahiers du Cinéma's list of the top 10 films of 2022.[52]

FatherPatrick de Chaworth, Lord of KidwellyMotherIsabella de Beauchamp
Maud de Chaworth (2 February 1282 – 3 December 1322) was an English noblewoman and wealthy heiress. She was the only child of Patrick de Chaworth. Sometime before 2 March 1297, she married Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, by whom she had seven children.


Early life[edit]
Maud was the daughter of Sir Patrick de Chaworth, Baron of Kidwelly, in Carmarthenshire, South Wales, and Isabella de Beauchamp. Her maternal grandfather was William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. Her father died on 7 July 1283; he was thought to be 30 years old. His paternal line was from the Castle of Chaources, now Sourches, in the Commune of St. Symphorien, near Le Mans in the County of Maine at the time of the Angevin Empire.[1] Three years later, in 1286, Isabella de Beauchamp married Hugh Despenser the Elder and had two sons and four daughters by him. This made Maud the half-sister of Hugh the younger Despenser. Her mother died in 1306.
Maud was only a year old when her father died, and his death left her a wealthy heiress. However, because she was an infant, she became a ward of Eleanor of Castile, wife of Edward I.
After Queen Eleanor's death in 1290, the King granted the right to arrange Maud's marriage to his brother Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster on 30 December 1292. Edmund arranged the marriage between Maud and one of his sons, Henry,[2] by Blanche of Artois, niece of Louis IX of France and Dowager Queen of Navarre by her first marriage

Marriage and issue[edit]
Henry and Maud were married sometime before 2 March 1297. Henry was a little older, having probably been born in 1280 or 1281. Maud brought her father's property to the marriage, including land in Hampshire, Glamorgan, Wiltshire, and Carmarthenshire. Maud is often described as the "Countess of Leicester" or "Countess of Lancaster", but she never bore the titles as she died in 1322, before her husband received them. 
Maud and Henry had seven children:

Blanche (c. 1302/1305 – c. 1380), Baroness Wake of Liddell
Henry of Grosmont (c. 1310–1361), Duke of Lancaster, one of the great English magnates of the 14th century
Maud (c. 1310 – 5 May 1377), Countess of Ulster
Joan (c. 1312–1345), married John de Mowbray, 3rd Baron Mowbray
Isabel of Lancaster, Prioress of Amesbury (c. 1317 – post-1347), prioress of Amesbury Priory
Eleanor (1318–1372), married John de Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont (died 1342), secondly Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel
Mary (c. 1320–1362), married Henry de Percy, 3rd Baron Percy

GatorSpeciesAlligatorGenderMale
Gabby Gator is an animated cartoon character, an anthropomorphic alligator who appeared in several cartoons produced by Walter Lantz and distributed by Universal Pictures.
Gabby lives in old lair in the Okiedokie Swamp, which is a play on Lake Okeechobee and is near Cape Canaveral. This place however does not have many food options, and so always hungry Gabby is forced to attract the food (usually Woody Woodpecker) to his home and attempt to capture him with anything he might have at hand, including highly advanced technology. Though Gabby Gator is intelligent and crafty, Woody always escapes, usually leaving Gabby hungry and with his home destroyed. The strangest thing about Gabby Gator is that he seems to have a vast supply of carrots, which are useless for a carnivorous reptile.


Appearance[edit]
Gabby is an always hungry green alligator who has a yellowish-green stomach and snout, Depending on the episode, wears a reddish-purple hat, a yellow vest, and has two fangs poking out of his muzzle. He speaks with a southern accent, similar to that of Hanna-Barbera's Huckleberry Hound.

History[edit]
Gabby Gator first appeared as "All. I. Gator" in the 1958 short Everglade Raid. In that short, Gabby—or "All"—tries to cook Woody for lunch. "All" appeared again in 1959's Romp in a Swamp. Gabby's first official appearance under his definitive name was in Southern Fried Hospitality, when he hardly never ate and caught Woody to stave off his starvation.
Gabby did not become as famous as Woody's more renowned enemies such as Wally Walrus and Buzz Buzzard. His final theatrical appearance was in Greedy Gabby Gator in 1963. Ms. Meany more or less replaced him as the recurring villain at that moment.

Later appearance[edit]
Gabby Gator later appeared in The New Woody Woodpecker Show in the episode "Corn Fed Up".

Alternative cover

Beyond Sanctorum is the second studio album by Swedish symphonic metal band Therion, released in January 1992. It was re-released on 27 November 2000 under the Nuclear Blast label as a part of The Early Chapters of Revelation boxset. It contains remastered songs, as well as four bonus tracks.


Recording and production[edit]
The band signed a contract with Active Records after the deal with previous label Deaf Records was signed only for one album and relations between band and label [Deaf] weren't positive. Therion began to record a second full-length album in The Montezuma Studio in 1991. Before the recordings started bass guitar player Erik Gustafsson decided to leave the band in order to return home to the U.S., but Therion continued as a trio with Peter Hansson, Oskar Forss and Christofer Johnsson filling in on bass guitar.[1]

Music, legacy, and lyrics[edit]
According to Christofer Johnsson, Beyond Sanctorum saw the band exploring "different elements", like Persian traditional music, and the inclusion of clean singing—female as well as male—to accompany increased keyboard experimentations.[2]
Deathmetal.org notes allusions to Celtic Frost and Obituary and a technique similar to that of Godflesh in layering of melodies, an approach that would be material to future black metal and death metal bands. With Beyond Sanctorum, Therion also added vibrant yet unsentimental solos and creative bass harmony to the metal music lexicon.[3]
The lyrics of the album diverge into the occult[1] and introduce a Lovecraftian influence with the track "Cthulhu".[4]

Tour[edit]
After recording album, Therion started to play their first live shows in central Europe, mainly in the Netherlands and Belgium, although simultaneously band ran into a few personnel problems. Forss decided to leave the band, Hansson quit the band after health problems. The shows were played using a new lineup. Piotr Wawrzeniuk, from the band Carbonized in which Johnsson also played, took up drumming duties. The guitar was taken up by Magnus Barthelsson, an old school friend of Johnsson's, while Andreas Wahl took up the bass.[1]

Reception[edit]
Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[5]Deathmetal.org considers Beyond Sanctorum a classic of early 1990s Swedish death metal, dubbing it an "endlessly inventive" album that "stimulate[s] fantasy and thought".[3]

Created in 1956, Samuel Ayer High School was the first high school in the City of Milpitas, California.  It was located at 1395 E. Calaveras Blvd.  Previous to its opening, Milpitas high school students attended James Lick High School in San Jose.  With the opening of Milpitas High School in 1969, the two schools coexisted until 1980 when declining enrollment caused Samuel Ayer to be closed.  The first graduating class of Milpitas High School did so in June 1971.
The campus has now been put to use as the Milpitas Sports Center, Teen Center and Adult Education Center.

Completion could take ten years.[3] In June 2023, Beliris asked for help from the Belgian Government, following a series of delays and cost overruns.[4] As of December 2022[update], construction of the new line was expected to be complete in 2032.

Jean Surhon, also known as Jean de Surhon, Jean Surhonio, Jean Surchon, Johann Surhonio or Ioannes Suthon, (born first half of the 16th century in Mons; died after 1594) was a Franco-Flemish engraver and cartographer.



Two other engravers and cartographers who shared the same name came from his family: Jacques Surhon (d. 1557), his father, and Jacques Surhon (d. 1610), probably his brother. Both worked in Mons. The father was also a silversmith.
From his cartographic work, three maps of areas in what is today north-eastern France and southern Belgium have survived: Namur (1553), Vermandois (1557) and Picardy (1557). The first edition of the atlas Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Abraham Ortelius — published in Antwerp in 1570 — contained the map of Vermandois. In another edition from 1579, the maps of Namur and Picardy by Ortelius were published.
In some editions - such as a print published by Pieter van den Keere in Amsterdam in 1622 - Jean Surhon is incorrectly named as the author of a map of the Artois region, actually created by father Jacques Surhon in 1554.[1]
The maps of Vermandois and Picardy were later used in the atlas Le Theater Francoys, published in Tours by Maurice Bouguereau in 1594

Balthazar P. Melick (also known as Baltus) (October 26, 1770 – November 20, 1835), an American merchant and banker, was the founder of Chemical Bank in 1823.  Melick served as the first president of Chemical from 1823 to 1831.[1]

Biography[edit]
Melick who was born in Lebanon Township, New Jersey in 1770, started as an apprentice at a mercantile house at the age of thirteen.[2]  In 1792, at the age of twenty-one he was admitted to a partnership and for many years he was a prosperous merchant in Greenwich Village in New York City.  In 1795, he was listed as a "grocer" doing business at 183 Washington Street.[3][4]   Melick founded the commercial house of Melick & Burger, which owned trade vessels sailing in the Caribbean, doing much of its business with the island of St. Croix.[2][3]  The firm, which had its offices at 76 Washington Street, owned a ship known as "Chase"[5] which afterwards was prominent in the sugar trade.[2]
He became a Director in the Equitable Fire Insurance Company, the Greenwich Fire Insurance[6] and the Union Marine and Life Insurance Company.[4]
Melick was also a noted member and secretary of the Black Friars Society, also known as the Friary, a music and social club.[3][4]

Founder of Chemical Bank[edit]
Melick founded the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company, the predecessor of Chemical Bank in 1823 together with John C. Morrison, Mark Spenser, Gerardus Post, James Jenkins, William A. Seely and William Stebbins.[1]  Melick and his partners used the manufacturing company, which produced chemicals such as blue vitriol, alum, nitric acid, camphor and saltpeter, as well as medicines, paints, and dyes as a means to securing a bank charter from the New York State legislature.[7]  During the 1820s, prospective bankers found that they were more likely to be able to successfully secure a charter if the bank were part of a larger business.  The following year, in April 1824, the company successfully amended its charter to allow Chemical to begin its banking practice.
Melick retired as president of the bank in 1831 in favor of John Mason, one of the richest merchants of his day in New York, and an early shareholder in the bank.[1]  Melick, who never married, died shortly thereafter in 1835.

Carrollton Courthouse Square Historic District is a historic district encompassing the courthouse square and surrounding commercial district in Carrollton, Greene County, Illinois. The district is centered on the Greene County Courthouse, a limestone Romanesque Revival building built in 1891–92. The courthouse occupies an entire city block at the center of the district. The twelve quarter blocks surrounding the courthouse comprise Carrollton's only business district. Development in the area began in 1821, when the first courthouse was built; at the time, the square was surrounded by new houses. The only house remaining from this period is the Hodges House, which was built in 1829 and is now a historical museum. The square assumed its commercial character between 1830 and 1855, when several brick stores were constructed. After 1855, the square gained several two- and three-story commercial buildings, which form the predominant type in the district. In addition to the commercial buildings, Carrollton's public library and post office are also located on the square.[2]
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 1, 1985.[1]

Machagai (Spanish pronunciation: [matʃaˈɣaj]) is a city in Chaco Province, Argentina. It is the head town of the Veinticinco de Mayo Department.


Toponimy[edit]
In the Qom language "Machagai" means "lowland", referring to its geographical features as a slope near rivers like the Bermejo and Paraná.

History[edit]
Native Argentines like the Qom people used to wander through the area, giving the place its name. After the end of the Argentine Civil War, the government turned its attention to scarcely populated regions of the country like Patagonia and Chaco and started to promote the arrival of immigrants to populate and strengthen them. The province of Chaco was one of the most transformed by this wave of immigration.[1] In 1909 the first Serbian immigrants from the Austro-Hungarian Empire came to Machagai and founded their agricultural colonies, in 1921 by State decree it was promoted to the category of town. Until the mid-20th century, Machagai continued to receive immigrants from Yugoslavia and Spain.[citation needed]

Gustaf Wilhelm PalmBorn14 March 1810near KristianstadDied20 September 1890 (1890-09-21) (aged 80)StockholmNationalitySwedishEducationThe Royal Swedish Academy of ArtsKnown forPaintingSignature
Gustaf Wilhelm Palm (14 March 1810, Herrelöv's Farm, near Kristianstad - 20 September 1890, Stockholm) was a Swedish landscape painter and art professor.[1]


Biography[edit]
After completing his basic education, a friend of the family provided the assistance he needed to study with Anders Arvid Arvidsson [sv] in Lund, who taught him drawing. On his recommendation, Palm was able to make some illustrations for a book on European algae by the botanist, Carl Adolph Agardh. He then attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and supported himself by doing more illustrations; notably for the zoologist, Sven Nilsson.
His early paintings were landscapes in the Romantic style that showed the influence of Carl Johan Fahlcrantz. After a trip to Norway in 1833, with Count Michael Gustaf Anckarsvärd [sv], who dabbled in lithography, he came under the influence of Johan Christian Dahl and began to depict nature more realistically. This change came to fruition in his book of lithographs from 1837.[2]
That same year, he went to Berlin for treatment of an unspecified eye disease. Rather than returning home, he travelled throughout Germany and spent two years in Vienna; finally arriving in Rome in 1840. That winter, he went to Venice, filling sketchbooks that he took back to Rome. Altogether, he spent eleven years in Italy, becoming part of a local community of Swedish artists that dominated the Swedish art scene until the ascension of the Düsseldorf School.[2]
In 1851, he toured through Spain and Paris on his way back to Sweden. The following year, he was named a member of the Royal Academy. In 1856, he married Eva Sandberg, the daughter of Professor Johan Gustaf Sandberg. Their daughter, Anna Palm de Rosa, also became a painter. He began teaching at the academy in 1859. His students gave him the nickname "Palma Vecchio" (Old Palm, in Italian), and he began signing his paintings with a picture of a palm tree. Upon his retirement in 1880, he was named professor emeritus.[3] He remained uninfluenced by the new styles of art that developed during his last years.
His works may be seen at the Nationalmuseum,[2] Göteborgs konstmuseum[4] and the Uppsala University Library.[5]

John Jewsbury Bradley (April 20, 1869 – May 21, 1948) was a United States Army officer and a brigadier general who commanded the Eighth Infantry Division during World War I.[1]


Early life[edit]
Bradley was born in Lake View, Illinois.[2] He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1891 and was commissioned in the Fourteenth Infantry. On September 14, 1893, Bradley married Caroline Sladen, daughter of Medal of Honor recipient Joseph A. Sladen and sister of Fred Winchester Sladen. They had three children: Frances Bradley, John J. Bradley Jr., and Joseph S. Bradley.[1]

Military career[edit]
Bradley served overseas in the Philippine insurrection, for which he received the Purple Heart Medal and a Silver Star Medal,[1] as well as in China.[3]
In 1912, he graduated from the Army School of Line and in the following year he graduated from the Army Staff College.[3] Bradley served on the War Department General Staff in 1917 and 1918 which earned him a Distinguished Service Medal.[1]
On June 26, 1918, he was promoted to brigadier general. He was sent to France along with the American Expeditionary Forces and commanded a brigade of the 82nd Infantry Division. In November 1918, Bradley commanded the Eighth Infantry Division.[1]
After the war, Bradley was reduced back to his permanent rank of lieutenant colonel in October 1919 and then promoted to colonel in January 1920. He commanded the Hoboken Port of Embarkation from June 1920 to July 1921 and the 18th Infantry Regiment from July 1923 to July 1927.[4]

Awards[edit]
Along with his medals from the United States, Bradley would also receive the Officer of the Legion of Honor from France, the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George from England, and the  Commander of the Order of the Crown from Italy.[3]

Death and legacy[edit]
Bradley retired as a colonel in 1927 due to disabilities, but went on to practice law in the state of New York.[1] He was advanced to brigadier general on the retired list in 1930.[5] Bradley became a trustee of the Disabled American Veterans Service Foundation. He also belonged to the Military Order of the World Wars, Guards' Club in London, and Army and Navy Club (Washington, D.C.). Bradley died on May 21, 1948, in Detroit, Michigan, at the age of seventy-nine.[1] Bradley and his wife Caroline were buried at the West Point Cemetery.[6]

History[edit]
The castle is not recorded in medieval sources, although the historian Johann Weikhard von Valvasor mentions that a manor stood on the site in the 14th century, built by the Grätzer family from nearby Gradac, whence its name derives. After passing through numerous hands, it was purchased by Anton Rudež in 1821. The author Janez Trdina was often Rudež's guest at Gracar Turn; several of Trdina's works were written at the castle, including his best-known, Tales and Stories of the Gorjanci Hills. During World War II part of the castle was burned down by the Partisans. It has since been renovated.
The core of the castle consists of a multistory residential palacium, surrounded by a rectangular complex anchored by two imposing square towers.

Notable people[edit]
Notable people that were born or lived at Gracar Turn include:

Janž Tulščak (?–1594), Protestant preacher and writer[2][3]

Notes[1][2][4]

MS Azura is a cruise ship operated by P&O Cruises and owned by Carnival plc. The ship was built by Fincantieri at their shipyard in Monfalcone, Italy. She officially entered service with the company in April 2010 and was named by Darcey Bussell.[4]


Delivery[edit]
Azura is a Grand-class ship, with a modified design which distinguishes her from early ships of the same class. Construction of Azura began in 2008 when her keel was officially laid on 27 October 2008.[5] A ceremonial float out took place on Friday 26 June 2009, with Amanda Dowds, wife of the ship's captain, acting as her godmother.[6] The formal handover took place on 26 March 2010.

Maiden voyage[edit]
Azura's maiden voyage began on 31 March 2010, when she departed from the Fincantieri shipyard en route to Southampton. She arrived in the UK on 7 April 2010. Azura's first cruise with passengers began on 12 April 2010.[7][8]

Naming[edit]
Azura at the Ocean Terminal ahead of her christening
Azura was formally named on 10 April 2010, by godmother Darcey Bussell.  As well as performing the traditional bottle breaking ceremony, as a former principal dancer of the Royal Ballet, Bussell presented a dance performance by Royal Ballet School as part of the celebrations. Azura was originally registered in her homeport of Southampton, UK, but in November 2011 she was re-registered to Hamilton, Bermuda to enable wedding ceremonies to be conducted on board.[9]

Facilities[edit]
The ship's facilities include a dance floor in the atrium, a show lounge and an interpretation of a London pub.[10]
An open-air cinema screen is situated in front of the funnel.[11]
In total, the ship has eleven restaurants and eating areas, twelve bars and places to drink, four pools, a gym, two spas, outdoor cinema, a theatre and two show lounges.[12]

Design, refits and COVID-19[edit]
Azura is the only Grand-class ship to feature a "Duck Tail" stern.
She completed a minor refit in April 2015 at Blohm and Voss's shipyard in Hamburg.[13] This included painting P&O's large Union flag design on to the bow, repainting the funnel in blue with P&O's "sunburst" logo plus minor interior updates.
Azura was berthed out of use at Port of Tyne International Passenger Terminal, North Shields, Tyne and Wear from 21 January 2021 to June due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She left for Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 29 June 2021 at 06:45 BST where she remained until returned to service.[citation needed]

Joan A. Ballweg (née Gottinger; born March 16, 1952) is an American business owner and Republican politician from Green Lake County, Wisconsin.  She is a member of the Wisconsin Senate, representing the 14th Senate district since 2021.  She previously served eight terms in the Wisconsin State Assembly, from 2005 to 2021, and was mayor of Markesan, Wisconsin, from 1991 to 1997.[1]


Early life and education[edit]
Joan Ballweg was born Joan Gottinger in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in the Milwaukee suburb West Allis.  She graduated from Nathan Hale High School in West Allis in 1970 and went on to attend the University of Wisconsin–Waukesha before earning her bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point in 1974.[2] She is married to Tom Ballweg, with whom she has four children.[3]

Early career[edit]
Ballweg worked as a first grade teacher from 1974 to 1976 in Memphis, Tennessee, before returning to Wisconsin with her family.  They settled in Sauk City, Wisconsin, before later relocating to Markesan, Wisconsin.  They started the Ballweg Implement Company in December 1976.[4]  In 1986, she was elected to the Markesan city council, and served in that role until she was elected mayor of Markesan in 1991.[2]  She won re-election in 1993 and 1995, and chose not to run for a fourth term in 1997.[5]  Her most noteworthy achievement as mayor was a merger of the city fire department with that of neighboring township.
In 1998, the Ballweg company bought out another farm implement store in Waupun, Wisconsin, and made that their primary business, closing their store in Markesan.[6]  After leaving office, she also served on the board of directors of Waupun Memorial Hospital, and became chairman of the board in 2001.[7]

State legislature[edit]
In 2004, the incumbent state representative in her district, Luther Olsen, chose to run for state senate, creating an open seat in the 41st Assembly district.  Ballweg entered the Republican primary in March 2004, citing her experience in education, local government, small business, and the health care industry.[7]  The race ultimately attracted a huge number of ambitious area Republicans, including the former Green Lake County sheriff, Lance Buchholtz, and Ballweg's successor as Markesan mayor, Rich Slate.  Ballweg ultimately prevailed over eight Republican primary opponents, taking 28% of the primary vote.[8]  Ballweg faced only a Constitution Party opponent in the general election, and prevailed with 84% of the vote.[9]  She would win re-election seven times in the 41st Assembly district.  In the Assembly, she was elected to caucus leadership in the 2011 and 2013 terms, serving as majority caucus chair.[1]  During the Trump administration, she also served as a member of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region V advisory council.[1]
In February 2020, state senator Luther Olsen announced he would not run for re-election later that year, creating an open seat in the 14th Senate district.  Later that day, Ballweg announced that she would run to succeed him in the Wisconsin Senate.[10]  Her only opponent in the 2020 primary was newcomer Ken Van Dyke, who she defeated with 69% of the vote.[11]  She faced retired union machinist Joni Anderson in the general election, and prevailed with 65% of the vote.[12]  In the state Senate, Ballweg was again elected to leadership, serving as caucus vice chair in the 2023 term.[1]
In the 2024 redistricting act, Ballweg was drawn out of the 14th Senate district.  She has since declared that she will run for re-election in the 14th Senate district, implying that she will relocate to maintain residency in the redrawn district.[13]

Personal life[edit]
Joan Gottinger took the last name Ballweg when she married Tom Ballweg in 1974.  They now have three adult children.[1]

Richard Alston (born November 20, 1980) is a former professional gridiron football wide receiver and return specialist who played for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He also played for the Edmonton Eskimos and Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL).
Alston played college football for the East Carolina Pirates as a quarterback, running back, and wide receiver. While at East Carolina University, Alston studied economics.[1] After failing to make the Browns' regular season roster in 2003, he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe, where he became a World Bowl champion. Alston played as a kick returner for the Browns in 2004 before playing in the CFL from 2006 to 2007.

College career[edit]
Alston played high school football at Warren County High School in Warrenton, North Carolina as a quarterback.[2][3] He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, Alston was used by the Pirates coaching staff in tandem with sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback.[4] As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, the Pirates coaching staff tried out Alston at several different positions. After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the position in which he would play out the rest of his college and professional careers.[5][6] In his final year with the Pirates, Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.[7]

Professional career[edit]
Alston went undrafted in the 2003 NFL Draft. He was signed by the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League in May 2003.[7] Alston did not make the Browns' regular season roster,[8] but he was allocated to the Berlin Thunder of NFL Europe. While with the Thunder in 2004, Alston threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Chas Gessner in World Bowl XII. The trick play, which had Alston line up as a receiver before throwing the ball, helped the Thunder defeat the Frankfurt Galaxy 30–24 to become World Bowl champions.[3]
In 2004, Alston returned to the Browns.[9] While he was not valuable to the Browns at wide receiver, the team used him as a return specialist. In a November game against the Baltimore Ravens, Alston scored his first NFL touchdown after returning the opening kickoff 93 yards.[10] He played in nine regular season games in 2004 returning kickoffs.[11] Alston returned to the Browns' training camp in 2005, where he competed with André Davis and Josh Cribbs to remain a kick returner.[12] The Browns released Alston in their final round of cuts.[13]
The Edmonton Eskimos of the CFL signed Alston in 2006. In training camp, he competed with several other import receivers for a roster spot, including former Denver Broncos player Chris Cole.[14] The coaching staff also evaluated him along with Tony Tompkins and Toby Zeigler to return kicks.[15] Alston solidified his spot on the roster by leading the team in preseason catches.[16] Alston remained on the roster into the regular season. After Eskimos wide receiver Trevor Gaylor dropped a pass near the Eskimos sideline during Week 1, the Eskimos coaching staff removed Gaylor from the starting lineup.[17] Alston started his first game in the CFL the following week against the Calgary Stampeders.[17] He suffered an ankle injury during his first start, but he quickly recovered to catch three passes for 76 yards two weeks later against the BC Lions.[18][19] In August, Gaylor reclaimed his starting position from Alston after Alston dropped a long pass in a game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.[1][20] Alston finished the regular season with seven games played, recording 23 catches for 261 yards and a single two-point conversion. Although the Eskimos had considered him as a potential kick returner in training camp, he returned only one kickoff along with three punts.[2]
In February 2007, the Eskimos traded Alston to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The deal also sent Nicolas Bisaillon, Timmy Chang, and a draft pick to the Tiger-Cats in exchange for defensive back Jason Goss.[21] The Tiger-Cats receiver corps were considered a weakness going into the 2007 season, and the team tried out at least fourteen receivers in training camp.[22] In mid-June, The Hamilton Spectator reported that Alston was showing potential in training camp and had a "leg up" to make the team.[23] Alston made the active roster for the regular season and played in one game for the Tiger-Cats, but he was released in early July.[2][24] He briefly signed with the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League in November 2007, but the Gladiators released Alston in February 2008 before the start of the regular season.[25][26]

The Lobor concentration camp or Loborgrad camp (Croatian: Koncentracijski logor Lobor) was a concentration camp established in Lobor, Independent State of Croatia (modern-day Croatia) in the deserted palace of Keglevich family. It was established on 9 August 1941, mostly for Serb and Jewish children and women. The camp was established and operated by Ustaše, with 16 of its guards being members of the local Volksdeutsche community. Its inmates were subjected to systematic torture, robbery and murder of "undisciplined" individuals. All younger female inmates of the Lobor camp were subjected to rapes. More than 2,000 people were inmates of this camp, at least 200 died in it. All surviving children and women were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in August 1942 where they all were killed.


Establishment[edit]
The Lobor concentration camp was established on 9 August 1942, mostly for Serb and Jewish children and women.[2][3][4] The camp was established in the deserted palace of Keglevich family.[5] It was established, operated and controlled by Ustasha Surveillance Service subordinated to Main Ustaša Headquarters, the guards were members of the German ethnic community (Volksdeutsche), totally 16 of them.[6] The maximum capacity of this camp was 800 inmates.[7]

The inmates[edit]
Because of the significant proportion of children among its inmates, this camp was categorized among children's concentration camp, besides Jablanac, Mlaka, Bročica brickyard, Uštica, Sisak, Jastrebarsko and Gornja Rijeka.[8] According to some sources, the total number of children inmates in concentration camps in Croatia in 1942 was at least 24,000.[9] The first contingent of inmates numbering 1,300 people was transported to Lobor camp from Kruščica concentration camp.[10] The number of women and children inmates in Lobor camp reached 1,500.[11] All younger female inmates of the Lobor camp were subjected to rapes by the commanding officers and guards,[12] which resulted with pregnancies, in some cases even of 14 years old girls.[13] Besides systematic rapes, the inmates were subjected to torture, robbery and murder of "undisciplined" individuals.[14] At least 200 women and children died in Lobor camp.[15] There was no mass killing of inmates in Lobor, 150 inmates died because of typhoid epidemy.[16]
Around 2,000 Jewish women and children were inmates of this concentration camp during its existence.[17] In period between 13 and 28 August 1942 all survived children and women were transported to Auschwitz concentration camp where they all were killed.[18][19][20]

Aftermath[edit]
In 2002 the Home for Mentally lll Adults Lobor-Grad was established in the object which housed the camp. According to its website, during the World War II its building was the almshouse of The Society for the Suppression of begging and supporting sick.[21]

Mickey Mouse (also known as Mickey Mouse Shorts) is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation. Featuring Disney cartoon characters Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy and Pluto in contemporary settings such as Paris, Venice, Tokyo and New York, the series has the slapstick feel of the earliest Mickey Mouse shorts while providing a modern update, and "presents Mickey in a broad range of humorous situations that showcase his pluck and rascality, along with his long-beloved charm and good heartedness".[3] The animation is provided by Mercury Filmworks.[4]
The series was developed by artist Paul Rudish, who was the co-creator of the Cartoon Network television series Sym-Bionic Titan and is also the series' executive producer and supervising director,[5] while Joseph Holt is the series' art director.[5] Chris Diamantopoulos was cast instead of Bret Iwan, because the producers wanted a voice that sounded similar to the one used by Walt Disney for Walt's portrayal of Mickey.[6] Paul Rudish, Jenny Gase-Baker and Joseph Holt won three Emmy Awards for their work on the series in September 2013.
The pilot episode, "Croissant de Triomphe", was first released as a special preview on March 12, 2013, on Disney.com.[3] The series officially premiered on June 28 of that year on Disney Channel & YouTube, followed by the releases on Disney.com and Watch Disney Channel.[3] A total of 18 episodes aired in the first season while the second season, premiering on April 11, 2014, consisting of 19 episodes.[5] The third season premiered on July 17, 2015, with 20 episodes aired.[7] The fourth season premiered on June 9, 2017, with 19 episodes aired. The fifth (later final) season of the original series premiered on October 6, 2018, with 18 episodes aired.[8]
The series was succeeded with The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse, which premiered on Disney+, on November 18, 2020, to coincide with Mickey's 92nd birthday.[9]

A Mickey Mouse-themed attractions, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway and Vacation Fun – An Original Animated Short with Mickey & Minnie, replaced The Great Movie Ride and Star Wars: Path of the Jedi at Disney's Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. This attraction was also located at the Mickey's Toontown section of Disneyland at the Disneyland Resort, which opened on January 27, 2023 in Anaheim, California.[41] The attraction is the third Mickey Mouse-themed attraction at any Disney property worldwide, only behind Mickey's PhilharMagic,[a] directly based on the series and involves guests watching the premiere of a new Mickey Mouse cartoon and then entering the cartoon itself. The show's creative team, including Paul Rudish, Joseph Holt and composer Christopher Willis, collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering to create the attractions, which opened on March 4, 2020, at Disney's Hollywood Studios.[42]

Music[edit]
On July 21, 2023, Walt Disney Records released a soundtrack album of several songs from the series.[43]

New Hampshire has 6 America East regular season titles (2009, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023), and eight NCAA tournament appearances (1994, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023).[2]
The Wildcats saw a surge to the top under the guidance of head coach Marc Hubbard which has gained them both regional and national recognition. He  helped UNH secure 4 regular-season conference titles, 4 conference tournament titles, and 6 NCAA tournaments during his 8-year tenure. Following the 2023 season, Hubbard announced he would be leaving the program. On January 4th, 2024, it was announced that Rich Weinrebe would become UNH's 12th men's soccer head coach.[3]

Postseason[edit]
NCAA Tournament[edit]
New Hampshire has appeared in eight NCAA Tournaments. They first appeared in the tournament in 1994. They didn't return to the national stage until 2017, achieving automatic qualification following their America East Conference tournament win. Their deepest runs into the tournament were in 2017, 2021, and 2023 when they reached the Third Round before losing to Indiana, Oregon State, and Clemson respectively.[6]

America East Conference Tournament[7][edit]
New Hampshire secured their first-ever America East conference tournament title in 2018 as they routed No. 5 UMBC 5–0 in the championship. This win kicked off a string of three consecutive America East tournament championships in the 2019 and 2020 seasons. In 2019, the Wildcats came in as the No. 1 seed and got by No. 3 Hartford 1–0 to clinch the title. In the 2020 season (partially played in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), UNH again came into the tournament as the No. 1 seed and held off No. 2 seeded Vermont 2–0 to complete the three-peat. After a loss to Vermont in 2021, the Wildcats captured their fourth America East championship in five years after defeating Albany 2–0 in the 2022 championship game.

Nick Arcade (also stylized Nickelodeon Arcade) is an American children's game show created by James Bethea and Karim Miteff and hosted by Phil Moore, with Andrea Lively announcing, that aired on Nickelodeon in 1992. It aired originally during weekend afternoons, with reruns airing until September 28, 1997. In the first season, the shows were taped in December 1991 and aired in early 1992.[4] It was taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando. In Nick Arcade, two teams of contestants played two initial trivia rounds, with the winning team advancing to the "Video Zone" to play against the virtual "Video Game Wizard" of the day.
The show's format combined video game trivia with contestant-interactive virtual reality. The virtual reality games were designed by Bethea and Miteff for Bethea/Miteff Productions and programmed by Curt Toumainian for Saddleback/Live Studios and Dean Friedman (for InVideo Systems). The show was the first in America to regularly intermix live action with animation using a bluescreen.[citation needed]


Gameplay[edit]
Phil Moore, host of Nick Arcade
Two teams of contestants played two initial rounds, with the winning team advancing to play against the "Video Game Wizard" of the day.

Face-off[edit]
Each round would start with one player from each team playing a video game for thirty seconds. The games here were designed specifically for the show and are listed below.



Game

Synopsis


Meteoroids

Space shooter where players moved crosshairs trying to zap the most flying targets, which included asteroids and ships. The player with the higher score won.


Laser Surgeon

Same shooter-type game as Meteoroids, but with an inside-the-body theme.


Brainstorm

Players tried to defend a brain's neurons from an electrical impulse that ricocheted side-to-side; comparable to a sped-up Pong. The team whose side took the fewest hits won.


Battle of the Bands

Same dodge-game as Brainstorm, but with an on-stage concert theme using speakers and a sound wave bouncing from side to side.


Star Defenders

Same dodge-game as Brainstorm, but with players protecting their spaceships from a comet.


Post-Haste

A side-scroller race-type game where players controlled a mailman trying to dodge obstacles; inspired by Paperboy. The winner was the player whose mailman moved the farthest. Appeared in Season 2 only.


Jet Jocks

Same side-scrolling game as Post-Haste, but with players controlling jet skiers avoiding obstacles along a river. Appeared in Season 2 only.


Crater Rangers

Same side-scrolling game as Post-Haste, but players controlled ATVs, avoiding obstacles on the moon. Appeared in Season 2 only.

These custom Face-Off games were developed by Bethea/Miteff Productions in conjunction with Saddleback/Live Studios and Psygnosis.
The winner of the face-off won 25 (first round) or 50 points (second round) for their team. If the face-off ended in a tie, a toss-up question was asked. The team also earned control of the game's cartoon mascot, "Mikey, the Video Adventurer".

Main rounds[edit]
In the main rounds, Mikey would be navigated over a thematic game-board by the teams. One team was Red, with the other Yellow (the latter, which was traditionally Blue in most Nickelodeon team-vs.-team game shows, was likely changed due to the Video Zone's blue chroma key setup). The game-board was divided into 18 squares, and Mikey was moved around the board in one of four basic directions (up, down, left, or right) toward a "Goal" space on the board. When new squares were landed on, various events would be uncovered, including trivia quizzes, video-based puzzles, bonus instant-win prizes, automatic point-adding squares, enemies and "Video Challenges." The latter involved one player of the team playing one of five video games in an attempt to beat a certain score or accomplish a certain objective within 30 seconds. Regardless of the outcome, both teams kept any prizes won during the first two rounds of the game.
More often than not, the round would end before Mikey reached the goal space due to time constraints. In such cases, Mikey was moved directly to the goal, and a question was asked; the first team to buzz in with the correct answer received the "Goal" points. After the round ends, the contents of the remaining squares were revealed. Round 2 was played the same way, but with point values doubled.

Mikey's World[edit]
Mikey's World had 11 different areas of exploration. These areas included:



Location

Synopsis


Pirate's Cove

An old-fashioned port area including a skull-shaped island.


Cape Cosmos

A space center that transported Mikey into outer space, where his adventures began for the players.


Camelittle

A medieval-themed area where knights, princesses and dragons roamed and fantasy came alive.


Specific Ocean

An underwater exploration area where the denizens of the deep abound.


Forgotten Desert

An Egyptian-style area that harbored mystery and intrigue.


Slurpy Gulch

A traditional lawless Wild West town with a southwestern feel.


Volcano Jungle

A rainforest jungle with a live volcano and a village nearby.


Creepyville

A haunted mansion near a spooky swamp.


Mikey's Neighborhood

A normal suburban neighborhood, home to Mikey as well as a bully nicknamed "Game Over."


WeGot'Em Mall

A shopping center near Mikey's neighborhood.


Time Portal

A vortex that Mikey traveled through, visiting his neighborhood both in the past and the future.

Moving Mikey[edit]
There were eight different types of spaces Mikey could land on:

The Four Ps ("Points, Puzzles, Pop Quizzes, and Prizes"):
Points - The team that moved Mikey was automatically awarded 25 points (50 in round 2) and kept control.
Video Puzzle - Different puzzles were played. The team that solved the puzzle received 25 points (50 in Round 2) and control of Mikey. Examples of video puzzles included identifying the artist in a music video with a scrambled picture and recalling a series of images flashed rapidly on the screen.
Pop Quiz - A question was asked that related to the area Mikey was traveling. The teams could buzz-in during the middle of the question. If a team answered correctly, they earned 25 points (50 in Round 2) and control of Mikey. (In early episodes, the team in control of Mikey would choose one of four categories.)
Prize - The team that moved Mikey won a prize and kept control. Any prize the team received was theirs to keep, regardless of the game's outcome.
Video Challenge - One of the contestants from a team chose one of five video games on stage to play (each of which could be played only once during an episode). The goal was to beat the "Wizard's Challenge" (renamed "Expert's Challenge" in Season 2), which was usually to achieve a certain score within 30 seconds for the game chosen. The other team member had three seconds (although it usually was not enforced) to write, using a Magna-Doodle, how much of their score they would gamble that the partner could complete the challenge. If the player met or beat the challenge, the wager was added to their score, and the team kept control of Mikey. If not, they lost the wager and the other team gained control. Teams could wager any amount from zero to their current score or the value of one question in that round, whichever was greater. In the event the other team member wagered more points than their current score, the wager was rounded down to their current score, only if the challenge was won. Each game could be played only once during an episode, and when it was chosen, the marquee light was turned off (though the game continued to run in attract mode). Only games with constantly visible on-screen score displays were used. Consoles used for this part of the show were the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, TurboGrafx-16 and Neo Geo.
Enemy - An animated enemy, which changed with the setting of the game board and "attacked" Mikey. Landing on an enemy square forfeited control to the opposing team.  Examples include the town bully in "Mikey's Neighborhood" and a genie in a Middle-Eastern themed level.
Time Bomb - In the rare occurrence that Mikey moved to a space that had already been landed on, a "Time Bomb" would occur. The team controlling Mikey had 10 seconds to spell a word, alternating letters back and forth between team members. If a team correctly "pong-spelled" a word, they kept control; otherwise, the other team would gain control. Regardless of the outcome, no points were awarded.
Goal - The Goal worked in two ways. If the team that moved Mikey moved him to the Goal, they alone were asked a question based on a category their opponents chose from a list of four categories (three in season 2). A correct answer earned 50 points in Round 1 (100 in Round 2) and the Goal for that round. If they answered incorrectly, the opponents got half the points available and the Goal by default. If time ran out before Mikey reached the goal, a sudden-death Pop Quiz question was asked for 50 points (100 in Round 2).
The team with the most points at the end of two rounds won the game. If the game ended in a tie, a 100-point tiebreaker question was asked. The winning team advanced to the Video Zone. The losing team received consolation prizes as well as any other prizes acquired during the game.

The Video Zone[edit]
The Video Zone was a live-action video game with three levels. Using a video monitor to see themselves, the contestants would be backstage, climbing ladders, throwing "snowballs", and using a boat in front of a bluescreen attempting to achieve previously explained goals (which was always to obtain three objects) for each level of the game.
As in a traditional video game, players could be "damaged" by hazards and enemy characters. If they lost all of their power (five units, as shown by an on-screen gauge), the screen would fade to grey, and they would have to start the stage over and repeat its objectives until successful (a couple of season 1 episodes had a message that read "Try again. Press START to continue.").  In addition, each level contained a 'power-up' that appeared periodically that, when touched, gave the player an added advantage in that level—destroying all onscreen enemies, freezing enemies for 5 seconds (rendering them harmless), restoring the team's power meter to maximum, etc.
The team had 60 seconds to clear all three levels. Each item touched won the team $50 to split, and each level cleared won a prize of increasing value. Successfully beating the Game Wizard in the final level won the grand prize, which was usually a vacation. If time ran out before the team completed the game, the losing horns (in the style of an evil laugh) sounded, the screen faded to red, and the words "Game over" appeared on the screen.

Level 1[edit]
Jungle Fever: A jungle setting where the player climbed palm trees to obtain three bunches of bananas at the top while avoiding coconut-throwing monkeys, as well as toucans, piranhas (seen once the player was above the waterfall) and snakes. The player could go behind the waterfall, or touch a golden idol to cause a rope to appear to help cross the waterfall safely.
Alien Moonbase: An intergalactic mechanical building where the player had to turn off three anti-matter reactors, while trying to avoid steam vents and attacking robots. Touching the main computer would immobilize all enemies and hazards, rendering them harmless for five seconds, and would also activate a "light bridge", which made the reactors easier to reach.
Ancient Tomb: A Mayan temple where the player had to grab three coins on both levels while trying to avoid bats, a statue's hammer, arrows shot from the ground, fireballs, and a mummy. Touching a beam of sunlight eradicated all enemies and unlocked all doors, revealing the hidden coins. (This level appeared in season 1 only.)
Season 2 only[edit]
Monsters on the Loose: A city besieged by alien UFOs, where now the giant player had to rescue three humans from being abducted by the UFOs, while avoiding monsters such as a giant laser-firing eyeball, a slimy earth-burrowing creature, and a monstrous cockroach. Touching a power rod released cosmic radiation, clearing the screen of all enemies and thus leaving the player unhindered for a few seconds.
Haunted Museum: A haunted mansion scene, where the player was required to pick up three statue busts hidden inside moving bookcases, while avoiding monsters such as a gargoyle, grasping tentacles, a vampire, and the "Hand of Doom". Pulling back a curtain bathed the room in sunlight, destroying all enemies and thus leaving the player unhindered for a few seconds.
Level 2[edit]
Runaway Rail Car: The player traveled on a railway car through a Wild West town and abandoned mines; he or she had to obtain three coins while avoiding vultures, hanging timbers, cactuses, tumbleweeds and rats. If the player touched a green "luck stone," he or she regained full power. (This level appeared in season 1 only.)
Nile River Raft: The player, floating on a fast-moving Egyptian river with a wooden raft, had to grab three gems while avoiding flies, alligators, rats, vultures and a mummy. Touching the legendary "Eye of the Pharaoh" diamond restored full power.
Mine Maze: A Mayan room gauntlet where the player had to collect three coins while dodging fireballs, spears, and electrified floor tiles. If the player touched a "Power" tile, he or she was granted immunity to all damage for a few seconds.
Cliffhanger: Taking place on a cliff with a network of caves, the player had to clear the cave openings to find three coins while avoiding rock slides, snakes, vultures and giant lizards. Touching a TNT device blasted open the cave openings, thus revealing all the coins.
Food Fight: A school lunch room setting where a food fight was taking place. The player had to grab three textbooks scattered on the floor, while avoiding flying food and the gym coach. Opening a locker with stinky gym shoes stopped the chaos for five seconds.
Season 2 only[edit]
Sub Search: An ocean scene with the player in a waverunner; the player had to collect three treasure chests while avoiding dangers such as sharks, eels, giant lobsters, explosive mines and squids. Touching a nuclear power cell, however, restored all power.
Enchanted Flight: A magic carpet scene, where the player had to grab three rings while avoiding swordsmen, gate traps, cobras, a royal guard, a baby dragon, guard dogs, and a genie that shot lightning bolts (the same Djinni from the Forgotten Desert in Mikey's World). Touching a magic lamp restored the player's health.
Snow Slingers: An arctic scene where the player had to hit three elves with snowballs while dodging those of the elves. The player also had to avoid skiing foxes, and hitting an ice-skating polar bear by mistake. Hitting a snowman made it play a song that forced the elves to stop attacking and dance in place for five seconds, making them much easier to hit.
Level 3 aka The Wizard Level[edit]
Both players, sharing one energy gauge, teamed up for the last level, which was a face-off against one of three villains, the evil wizard Merlock who conjured lightning bolts, a fireball-throwing sorceress named Scorchia, and the armor-clad monster Mongo who tossed balls of energy. To defeat them, the players had to touch three orbs before time expired, while trying to avoid the Game Wizard, the enemy projectiles, the ghostly creatures flying around the room, and the beams of lightning, fire, or energy (depending on who the Wizard was) that erupted from the ground. If either player touched a spinning hourglass that randomly appeared, all enemies and hazards would be immobilized and rendered harmless for five seconds.
Upon the Wizard's defeat, depending on who the players faced, Merlock would disintegrate into a pile of dust, Scorchia's body would burn to ashes and blow away, and Mongo would vanish in a flash of light, leaving only his armor behind. The message "You did it! You beat the game." would appear across the screen.
In Season 1, the Wizards had nearly identical rooms (with only different color schemes depending on the Wizard with Merlock in a purple room, Scorchia in a red-orange room, and Mongo in a green room). In Season 2, the mechanics were the same as before, but each Wizard was given a more customized room:

Merlock's lair has bubble-like objects
Scorchia's lair has crystals
Mongo's lair is a frosty snow cave
Pilot[edit]
The show taped four pilots, with a videotape of one of the episodes available. The format was basically the same, but there were some differences. Niells Schurman and Fran Gauchi were the host and announcer. The episode was taped on the same set as Get the Picture. The team colors were red and blue. The face-off games were much slower. The theme music was the same theme from a previous Nickelodeon show, Outta Here. The sound effects were from Double Dare and Get the Picture. Mikey was animated differently and had no music when he moved to a square. One of the Enemy squares was revealed to the teams before the round started. The Video Challenge was called "Arcade." The team that landed on the square sent one player on stage to choose from seven available games while the other player stayed at the podium to write down the wager instead of both players coming down, and wager is written on a piece of paper instead of a magnetic board. The games were set up in customized TV cabinets instead of arcade style cabinets. Also, games could be played more than once, instead of only being available once a day. The Time Bomb challenge was considered a Video Puzzle and instead of spelling words, required teams to come up with multiple answers to a specific question. The Video Zone was four levels instead of three, with no Wizard in the final level. When a contestant completed a level, the clock would stop, with the host revealing statistics, before the next level began.

Notable celebrities[edit]
Joey Fatone, later a member of *NSYNC, appeared on season 1, episode 14 of the show as a contestant (using his full given name, Joseph). His team did not make it to the Video Zone.
The casts of Clarissa Explains it All, Salute Your Shorts, and Welcome Freshmen appeared on three special celebrity episodes to compete for charity during Season 2. In the Salute Your Shorts episode, the game was played as per the normal rules; however in the other two episodes both teams advanced to the Video Zone while Salute Your Shorts had just the winning team moving on.
Attempted revival[edit]
In 2015, James Bethea and Karim Miteff proposed a spiritual successor to Nick Arcade on Kickstarter, called Enthlevel. The proposed show would again be hosted by Phil Moore, and update the chroma key technology of the original to incorporate modern advancements in motion capture and virtual reality.[5] The Kickstarter was not able to meet its proposed US$350,000 goal.

Mali Mokri Lug (Serbian Cyrillic: Мали Мокри Луг) is an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, Serbia. It is located in the south-eastern section of Belgrade's municipality of Zvezdara. It marks the border with the municipality of Grocka. It mostly stretches between Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and the Highway Belgrade–Niš, but also north of the boulevard (Zeleno Brdo). It extends into the neighborhoods of Mirijevo on the north, Konjarnik on the west, Medaković III on the south-west, Veliki Mokri Lug on the south and Kaluđerica (in Grocka municipality) on the east.


Geography[edit]
Mali Mokri Lug occupies the northern section of the Mokroluški potok valley, which is today used as a route for the Belgrade-Niš highway and divides Mali Mokri Lug and Veliki Mokri Lug. The neighborhood occupies the southern slopes of several hills (Bajdina, Zeleno Brdo, Stojčino Brdo with an altitude of 270 m or 886 ft), descending into the Mokroluški potok's valley, so the entire neighborhood is built downhill.

History and administration[edit]
Antiquity[edit]
Belgrade's predecessor was a Celtic and Roman town of Singidunum. While the town's castrum occupied part of today's Belgrade Fortress, Singidunum's civilian zone spread from the modern Kralja Petra Street, over the both Sava and Danube slopes, till the neighborhood of Kosančićev Venac, extending in a series of necropolises from Republic Square, along the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra all the way to Mali Mokri Lug.[1] One of the forts built by the Romans to protect the Via Militaris road, was Mutatio ad Sextum, on the location of modern neighborhood.[2]
The Romans built an aqueduct to conduct water from the hill of Stojčino Brdo, sometime in the first half of the 1st century. It extended down the route Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra-Cvetkova Pijaca-Vojislava Ilića Street-Mileševska Street-Pioneers Park, into the castrum. Some parts of this waterworks system remained in use up to the 1870s. The water spring at Stojčino Brdo is still operational, and one of the reservoirs of the city's modern water supply system is located there.[3][4]

Modern history[edit]
From 1929 to 1944, Mali Mokri Lug hosted a Buddhist temple built by the Kalmyk, refugees who had fought the Red Army in Russia and settled in Serbia, like many other White (Russian) refugees. This was the oldest permanent Buddhist temple in Europe outside of the Russian and British empires. Since most Kalmyks fled in fear of the advancing Red Army, Josip Broz Tito's partisans requisitioned the building, damaged in the fighting for Liberation of Belgrade, turned it into a community centre, but a few years later sold it to a machinery plant which pulled it down and built a concrete workshop in its stead.
Mali Mokri Lug used to be a separate village, outside Belgrade's urban zone. As Belgrade developed, with the construction of the large neighborhood of Konjarnik in the 1960s and 1970s and Mali Mokri Lug's rapid development as a suburb, it became part of the city's urban tissue and lost separate status after 1971, becoming a local community (mesna zajednica, sub-municipal administrative unit) within Belgrade city proper (uža teritorija grada). Mali Mokri Lug continued to grow and now makes the easternmost section of Belgrade's urban proper, developing further east along Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and Smederevski put, its continuation. With this growth, it now also makes continuous built-up area with formerly separate Veliki Mokri Lug (on the highway, at "Lasta" garage, at a tripoint with Kaluđerica's sub-neighborhood of Klenak at the bridge over the highway and with Kaluđerica directly along Smederevski put ).
Mali Mokri Lug had its own municipality in the 1950s. It was abolished on 1 January 1957 and merged into Zvezdara. It also comprised Kaluđerica, Leštane and Vinča which were later detached and annexed to the municipality of Grocka. Population of the municipality by the 1953 census was
In June 2017, a new community health center was opened.[5]

Population[edit]
According to the 2002 census of population, Mali Mokri Lug had 22,024 inhabitants. It had a population of 1,600 in 1921 and 10,378 in 1971, before it was attached to Belgrade. Its name can be translated into English as "little wet grove". Likewise, the neighboring Veliki Mokri Lug means "large wet grove". The name originates from the presence of numerous water sources, now mostly in the eastern section of Veliki Mokri Lug. Near the highway, a cemetery for both neighborhoods is located (Mokroluško groblje). The area is primarily residential, but a major commercial zone developed along Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, with many repair shops, stores, etc.

Symposiachrus is a genus of birds in the family Monarchidae. Most species are endemic to islands in Melanesia but the spectacled monarch is widely distributed and occurs in parts of Indonesia and western Australia. The genus was previously lumped together in the genus Monarcha.

Taxonomy and systematics[edit]
Based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2005, the genus Monarcha was split and 19 species moved to the resurrected genus Symposiachrus that had been introduced by the French naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854 with the spectacled monarch (Symposiachrus trivirgatus) as the type species.[2][3] The genus name Symposiachrus combines the Ancient Greek συν/sun meaning "together", ποσις/posis meaning "husband" and αχρως/akhrōs meaning "pallid".[4]
The genus Symposiachrus contains the following twenty–one species:[5]

Francis bin Fathallah bin Nasrallah Marrash (Arabic: فرنسيس بن فتح الله بن نصر الله مرّاش, ALA-LC: Fransīs bin Fatḥ Allāh bin Naṣr Allāh Marrāsh; 1835,[1] 1836,[2][a] or 1837[3][b] – 1873[5] or 1874[1]), also known as Francis al-Marrash or Francis Marrash al-Halabi, was a Syrian scholar,[6] publicist,[6] writer and poet of the Nahda or the Arab Renaissance, and a physician. Most of his works revolve around science, history and religion, analysed under an epistemological light. He traveled throughout West Asia and France in his youth, and after some medical training and a year of practice in his native Aleppo, during which he wrote several works, he enrolled in a medical school in Paris; yet, declining health and growing blindness forced him to return to Aleppo, where he produced more literary works until his early death.
Historian Matti Moosa considered Marrash to be the first truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to the principles of the French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in West Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.


Life[edit]
Background and education[edit]
Francis Marrash was born in Aleppo, a city of Ottoman Syria (present-day Syria), to an old Melkite family of merchants known for their literary interests.[7] Having earned wealth and standing in the 18th century, the family was well established in Aleppo,[8] although they had gone through troubles: a relative of Francis, Butrus Marrash, was killed by the wali's troops in the midst of a Catholic–Orthodox clash in April 1818.[9] Other Melkite Catholics were exiled from Aleppo during the persecutions, among them the priest Jibrail Marrash.[10][c] Francis' father, Fathallah, tried to defuse the sectarian conflict by writing a treatise in 1849, in which he rejected the Filioque.[12] He had built up a large private library[13] to give his three children Francis, Abdallah and Maryana a thorough education, particularly in the field of Arabic language and literature.[14]
Aleppo was then a major intellectual center of the Ottoman Empire, featuring many thinkers and writers concerned with the future of the Arabs.[6] It was in the French missionary schools that the Marrash family learnt Arabic with French and other foreign languages (Italian and English).[6] But Francis at first studied the Arabic language and its literature privately.[15] At the age of four years, Marrash had contracted measles, and had ever since suffered from eye problems that had kept worsening over time.[16] Hoping to find a treatment, his father had therefore taken him to Paris in 1850; Francis stayed there for about a year, after which he was sent back to Aleppo while his father remained in Paris.[17][d] In 1853, Francis accompanied his father once again, on a business trip of several months to Beirut, where there was a noticeable presence and cultural influence of Europeans.[19] Francis experienced similar cultural contact later on, when he received private tutoring in medicine for four years under a British physician, in Aleppo—he had by then developed a keen interest in science, and in medicine in particular.[20] At the same time, he wrote and published several works.[21] Marrash practiced medicine for about a year;[15] however, deeming it safer for his trade to become a state-licensed physician, he went to Paris in 1866 so as to continue his medical education at a school.[20] But his fragile health and his growing blindness forced him to interrupt his studies within a year after his arrival.[15] He returned to Aleppo completely blind, but still managed to dictate his works.[6]

Literary career[edit]
Ghabat al-haqq[edit]
Title page of an 1881 reprint of Ghabat al-haqq
Around 1865, Marrash published Ghabat al-haqq ("The Forest of Truth" or "The Forest of Justice"), an allegory about the conditions required to establish and maintain civilization and freedom.[22][e] This allegory relates the apocalyptic vision of a war between a Kingdom of Liberty and a Kingdom of Slavery, resolved by the capture of the latter's king and a subsequent trial before the King of Liberty, the Queen of Wisdom, the Vizier of Peace and Fraternal Love, the Commander of the Army of Civilization, with the Philosopher from the City of Light—who represents the author—as counsel.[26] In this work, Marrash expressed ideas of political and social reforms,[f] highlighting the need of the Arabs for two things above all: modern schools and patriotism "free from religious considerations".[28] In 1870, when distinguishing the notion of fatherland from that of nation and applying the latter to Greater Syria, Marrash would point to the role played by language, among other factors, in counterbalancing religious and sectarian differences, and thus, in defining national identity.[29]
Although Marrash's poetical expression lacked the legal meticulousness found in works from Enlightened Europe,[30] orientalist Shmuel Moreh has stated that Marrash became, with Ghabat al-haqq, "the first Arab writer to reflect the optimism and humanistic view of 18th-century Europe. This view stemmed from the hope that education, science and technology would resolve such problems of humanity as slavery, religious discrimination, illiteracy, disease, poverty, war, and other scourges of mankind, and it gave utterance to his hope for brotherhood and equality among peoples."[31] Yet, his views on freedom differed from those of the French revolutionists and of his Middle Eastern contemporaries; indeed, he considered pleading for freedom on the basis of natural analogy to be superficial, for even nature responds to its own set of rules, according to Marrash.[32] As a consequence, nothing in the universe may yearn for liberty without satisfying essential rules and needs that guarantee its existence.[32] Being one of these, the need for progress may therefore justify the abolition of any restriction that does not serve as a regulator for a good system.[32] In light of this reasoning, and in reference to the ongoing American Civil War, he thus in Ghabat al-haqq supported the abolition of slavery.[33]



It is by Love that the whole world is maintained, [by Love all things move,] by Love each creature perpetuates itself separately, and by Love the whole preserves its parts [and so forth]. [...] He who calls Love the goddess of human society is not wrong, because of the strange effects and miraculous impressions produced by her among men. If a statue of her were to [be created] and set upon the altar of the mind, it would take the form of a woman who is all fair, without one blemish.


—Excerpt from Ghabat al-haqq, translated by Khalil Hawi[34]

But the significance of this work also lay in Marrash's attempt to blend European thought with his own reading of the Christian belief in universal love.[35] Indeed, he had tried to reconcile his philosophical understanding of the concept of liberty with his belief in the benevolence of the Catholic Church's authority.[36] As stated by Nazik Saba Yared: He argued that only the spiritual kingdom [i.e. the kingdom centered on religion] could curb evil [...] and consequently guarantee the freedom of man. Love is one of the pillars of Christianity, and Marrash, like some Sufis and Romantics, considered it to be the basis of civilization, indeed of the entire universe [...]. Since love, for Marrash, was the general law, and freedom meant participation in that law, it followed that freedom would be inseparable from love and religion.[30]
Later writings[edit]
Title page of an 1883 reprint of Mashhad al-ahwal
In 1867, Marrash published Rihlat Baris, an account of his second journey to Paris.[21] The book begins with a description of his progress from Aleppo to İskenderun, Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Jaffa, Alexandria, Cairo, and then back to Alexandria from which he had boarded a ship to Marseille, where he arrived in October 1866.[37] The Arab cities had inspired in him revulsion and indifference, except Alexandria and Cairo, where Ismail Pasha had already begun modernization projects.[38] He had then travelled through France, with a stopover in Lyon before ending up in Paris.[38] Marrash was fascinated by France, and by Paris the most; everything he described in his account, from the Paris Exhibition of 1867 to gas lighting in the streets, served to praise the accomplishments of Western civilization.[39] In Mashhad al-ahwal ("The Witnessing of the Stages of Human Life"), published in 1870, Marrash would again compare the East and the West, writing that "while the East sank deeper into darkness, the West embraced light".[40] The optimism he had formerly expressed about the first reform currents under the reign of Sultan Abdülaziz in the Ottoman Empire[g] gave way to pessimism in Mashhad al-ahwal, as he realized these reforms were superficial and that those he had hoped for would not soon come into being.[42] Yet, in Durr al-sadaf fi ghara'ib al-sudaf (Pearl Shells in Relating Strange Coincidences), which he published two years later, he depicted the Lebanese social life of his day and criticised the blind imitation of Western customs and the use of the French language in everyday life.[43]
Throughout his life, Marrash composed many essays about science (especially mathematics), and about education,[44] a subject which mattered a lot to him; indeed, he wrote in Ghabat al-haqq that "without the education of the mind, man is a mindless beast".[45] He also wrote many articles in the popular press;[46] in those published in Butrus al-Bustani's journal Al-Jinan, he showed himself favourable to women's education, which he restricted however to reading, writing, and a little bit of arithmetic, geography and grammar.[21] In an 1872 issue of Al-Jinan, he wrote that it is not necessary for a woman "to act like a man, neglect her domestic and family duties, or that she should consider herself superior to the man"; he nonetheless closely followed his sister's studies.[6] Marrash also condemned Arab men's severe treatment of their wives and daughters.[47] In his later works, he tried to demonstrate the existence of God and of the divine law; the Sharia, as he conceived it, was not restricted to the sphere of the Islamic law alone.[6]

Style[edit]


Mention no longer the driver on his night journey and the wide striding camels, and give up talk of morning dew and ruins. [...]I no longer have any taste for love songs on dwellings which already went down in seas of [too many] odes. [...]So, too, the ghada, whose fire, fanned by the sighs of those enamored of it, cries out to the poets: "Alas for my burning!"[i] [...]If a steamer leaves with my friends on sea or land, why should I direct my complaints to the camels?


—Excerpt from Mashhad al-ahwal, translated by Shmuel Moreh[31]

Marrash often included poems in his works, written in muwashshah and zajal forms according to the occasion.[53] Shmuel Moreh has stated that Marrash tried to introduce "a revolution in diction, themes, metaphor and imagery in modern Arabic poetry",[54][j] sometimes even mocking conventional poetic themes.[56] In the introduction to his poetry book Mir'at al-hasna' (The Mirror of the Beautiful One), which was first published in 1872, Marrash rejected even the traditional genres of Arabic poetry, particularly panegyrics and lampoons.[57] His use of conventional diction for new ideas marked the rise of a new stage in Arabic poetry which was carried on by the Mahjaris.[53] Shmuel Moreh has also considered some passages from Ghabat al-haqq and Rihlat Baris to be prose poetry, while Salma Khadra Jayyusi has described his prosaic writing as "often Romantic in tone, rising sometimes to poetic heights, declamatory, vivid, colourful and musical", calling it the first example of poetic prose in modern Arabic literature.[58]

Legacy[edit]
Portrait of Francis Marrash by Kahlil Gibran, c. 1910
Kahlil Gibran was a great admirer of Marrash,[59] whose works he had read at al-Hikma School in Beirut.[60] According to Shmuel Moreh, Gibran's own works echo Marrash's style and "many of [his] ideas on enslavement, education, women's liberation, truth, the natural goodness of man, and the corrupted morals of society".[61] Khalil Hawi has referred to Marrash's aforementioned philosophy of universal love as having left a deep impression on Gibran.[62] Moreover, Khalil Hawi has stated that many of Marrash's recurring expressions became stock images for Arab writers of the 20th century: he has mentioned, for example, "the valleys of mental contemplation", "the wings of thoughts", "solicitudes and dreams", "the veils of history", "the Kingdom of the Spirit", "the nymphs of the forest, the spring and the dawn", "golden diadems", "the jewels of light", "the storms of days and nights", and "the smoke of revenge and the mist of anger".[62]

Notes[edit]


^ Jurji Zaydan provided the date of "June 29".[2]

^ Sharon Halevi and Fruma Zachs referred to an obituary of Marrash published in an 1897 issue of Al-Hilal.[4]

^ Little is known about the lives of Butrus Marrash and Jibrail Marrash. Butrus was married by the time he was killed, and the name of his father was Nasrallah Marrash; Niqula al-Turk wrote a funeral ode for him.[11]

^ Marrash's father seems to have been chosen by the Greek Orthodox Church "to collect aid from the governments and churches" of "various countries" on behalf of Aleppine Christians after the massacre of Aleppo of 1850.[18]

^ The first edition of Ghabat al-haqq was printed by the Maronites of Aleppo.[23] After Marrash's death, it was reprinted in Cairo in 1880 or 1881, and in Beirut in 1881.[24] A revised and prefaced edition by Abd al-Masih al-Antaki was printed in Cairo in 1922; the editor removed some grammatical errors and colloquial expressions found in the work.[25]

^ For example, he called for the introduction of representative democracy with equal suffrage, equality before the law, the development of infrastructure, support for trade and commerce, state funds for inventors, and the regular maintenance of buildings and public space.[27]

^ In 1861, shortly before Abdülaziz's ascension to the throne, Marrash had already published a poetic eulogy to Mehmed Fuad Pasha (an influential Ottoman statesman in the Tanzimat era) in the February 7 issue of Hadiqat al-Akhbar (the first bi-weekly newspaper in Beirut).[41]

^ This work was serialized in one of the Ottoman official journals.[49]

^ The charcoal of the ghada tree (Haloxylon persicum) was frequently mentioned in classical Arabic poetry as retaining its fire a great length of time.[52]

^ For example, Marrash tried to derive new poetic images from modern inventions and scientific discoveries.[55] In a poem from his collection Mir'at al-hasna', he thus wrote that "the passing of the day in a life span is speedy like the wheels of a train in the desert"; in another poem, he spoke of the "electricity of the languor in the eyelids" (translations by Shmuel Moreh).[55]

Cameron Ellis-Yolmen (born 28 January 1993) is a former professional Australian rules footballer, most recently playing for the Brisbane Lions in the Australian Football League (AFL), having played for the Adelaide Football Club from 2014 until 2019. He was drafted at pick 64 in the 2011 National Draft. Cam currently plays for the Wodonga Raiders in the Ovens & Murray Football League[1]


Early life[edit]
Ellis-Yolmen was born in Adelaide, New South Wales to mother Kylie an Indigenous Australian from Koonibba on the west coast of South Australia.[2] and father Ellis-Yolmen's father of Papua New Guinea.[3] He moved to Adelaide in South Australia when he was very young.
Ellis-Yolmen played his junior football with 80 games at the Lockleys Football Club before playing senior football with Flinders Park Football Club in the SAAFL and Woodville West Torrens Football Club in the SANFL where he was noticed by recruiters from AFL club Adelaide.[4]

AFL career[edit]
Ellis-Yolmen did not play an AFL match in his first two seasons, establishing himself in the senior side of Woodville-West Torrens in the SANFL.[5] Despite having not yet played an AFL game, he was chosen in the Australian squad in the 2013 Indigenous International Rules series against Ireland.[6] Whilst in Ireland, Ellis-Yolmen was the subject of controversy when he posted a photo of himself holding a rifle.[7]
Ellis-Yolmen finally made his AFL debut in Round 12, 2014 against Fremantle, playing as the substitute and gathering only five disposals.[8] He was dropped to the SANFL the following week and dislocated his finger against Central District, hindering his prospects of a recall.[9] He did not play another AFL game in 2014, but impressed playing in the midfield in Adelaide's new reserves team, finishing fourth in the best and fairest and having the most disposals, clearances and tackles for the team.[10]
Ellis-Yolmen started 2015 in Adelaide's best lineup, showing excellent form in averaging 20 disposals in the first five rounds. Afterwards his form tapered off and he was dropped after round 15.[5]
He was delisted by Adelaide at the conclusion of the 2017 season[11] but regained a place on their list for the 2018 season.
In the 2019 Trade period the Brisbane Lions signed Ellis-Yolmen as an unrestricted free agent with the Adelaide Crows receiving a third-round compensation pick.
In January 2022 Brisbane Lions moved Ellis-Yolmen to the Inactive List following his decision not to comply with the AFL's Covid vaccination requirements.[12]

Personal life[edit]
Ellis-Yolmen's father is from Papua New Guinea, and his mother is an Indigenous Australian from Koonibba on the west coast of South Australia. Cam currently resides in Wodonga, working in the renewable energy sector for Next Generation Energy[2]

Megacerops ("large-horned face", from méga- "large" + kéras "horn" + ōps "face") is an extinct genus of the prehistoric odd-toed ungulate (hoofed mammal) family Brontotheriidae, an extinct group of rhinoceros-like browsers related to horses. It was endemic to North America during the Late Eocene epoch (38–33.9 mya), existing for approximately 4.1 million years.[1]


Taxonomy[edit]
Megacerops was named by Leidy (1870). Its type species is Megacerops coloradensis. It was synonymized subjectively with Menodus by Clark and Beerbower (1967). It was assigned to Brontotheriidae by Leidy (1870), Carroll (1988), Mader (1989), and Mader (1998).[2][3]
According to Mihlbachler and others,[4][5] Megacerops includes the species of the genera Menodus, Brontotherium, Brontops, Menops, Ateleodon, and Oreinotherium.

Description[edit]
Restoration of M. coloradensis Megacerops head reconstruction at the American Museum of Natural History
All of the species had a pair of blunt horns on their snout (the size varying between species), with the horns of males being much larger than those of the females. This could indicate that they were social animals which butted heads for breeding privileges.
Despite resembling the rhinoceros, it was larger than any living rhinoceros: the living animal easily approached the size of the African forest elephant, the third-largest land animal today. It stood about 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) tall at the shoulders with an overall length(including tail) of 4.63 m (15.2 ft).[6]: 666  Its skull reached 89.5 cm (35.2 in) in greatest length, with some specimens possessing substantial canines, up to 70 mm long.[6]: 494, 523  Megacerops resembled a large rhinoceros, possessing blunt Y-shaped horn-like protrusions on its nose up to 43 cm in length.[6]: 553  Its mass is estimated to be in the range of 3.3–3.8 t (3.6–4.2 short tons) [7][8]
The dorsal vertebrae above the shoulders had extra long spines to support the huge neck muscles needed to carry the heavy skull. The shape of its teeth suggests that it preferred food such as soft stems and leaves, rather than tough vegetation. It may have had fleshy lips and a long tongue for carefully selecting food.

Paleobiology[edit]
Skull in Zurich
The skeleton of an adult male was found with partially healed rib fractures, which supports the theory that males used their 'horns' to fight each other. No creature living in Megacerops' time and area except another Megacerops could have inflicted such an injury.[9] The breathing movements prevented the fractures from completely healing. The adults may have also used their horns to defend themselves and their calves from predators, such as hyaenodonts, entelodonts, Bathornis or nimravids.

Distribution[edit]
Fossils were uncovered in the northern plains states. Life-sized models of Megacerops families (a male, female, and juvenile) are displayed at the James E. Martin Paleontological Research Laboratory, South Dakota School of Mines & Technology, and a different set at the Canadian Museum of Nature.
Many remains have been found in South Dakota and Nebraska. In the past, specimens exposed by severe rainstorms were found by Native Americans of the Sioux tribes. The Sioux called them "thunder beasts", a name preserved in the ancient Greek translation (bronto-, thunder; therion, beast).[10] Many of the skeletons found by the Sioux belonged to herds which were killed by volcanic eruptions of the Rocky Mountains, which were volcanically active at the time.

A series circuit with a voltage source (such as a battery, or in this case a cell) and three resistance units
Two-terminal components and electrical networks can be connected in series or parallel. The resulting electrical network will have two terminals, and itself can participate in a series or parallel topology. Whether a two-terminal "object" is an electrical component (e.g. a resistor) or an electrical network (e.g. resistors in series) is a matter of perspective. This article will use "component" to refer to a two-terminal "object" that participates in the series/parallel networks.
Components connected in series are connected along a single "electrical path", and each component has the same electric current through it, equal to the current through the network. The voltage across the network is equal to the sum of the voltages across each component.[1][2]
Components connected in parallel are connected along multiple paths, and each component has the same voltage across it, equal to the voltage across the network. The current through the network is equal to the sum of the currents through each component.
The two preceding statements are equivalent, except for exchanging the role of voltage and current.
A circuit composed solely of components connected in series is known as a series circuit; likewise, one connected completely in parallel is known as a parallel circuit. Many circuits can be analyzed as a combination of series and parallel circuits, along with other configurations.
In a series circuit, the current that flows through each of the components is the same, and the voltage across the circuit is the sum of the individual voltage drops across each component.[1] In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each of the components is the same, and the total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each component.[1]
Consider a very simple circuit consisting of four light bulbs and a 12-volt automotive battery. If a wire joins the battery to one bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, to the next bulb, then back to the battery in one continuous loop, the bulbs are said to be in series. If each bulb is wired to the battery in a separate loop, the bulbs are said to be in parallel. If the four light bulbs are connected in series, the same current flows through all of them and the voltage drop is 3 volts across each bulb, which may not be sufficient to make them glow.  If the light bulbs are connected in parallel, the currents through the light bulbs combine to form the current in the battery, while the voltage drop is 12 volts across each bulb and they all glow.
In a series circuit, every device must function for the circuit to be complete. If one bulb burns out in a series circuit, the entire circuit is broken. In parallel circuits, each light bulb has its own circuit, so all but one light could be burned out, and the last one will still function.

Series circuits are sometimes referred to as current-coupled or daisy chain-coupled. The current in a series circuit goes through every component in the circuit. Therefore, all of the components in a series connection carry the same current.
A series circuit has only one path through which its current can flow. Opening or breaking a series circuit at any point causes the entire circuit to "open" or stop operating. For example, if even one of the light bulbs in an older-style string of Christmas tree lights burns out or is removed, the entire string becomes inoperable until the faulty bulb is replaced.

In a series circuit, the current is the same for all of the elements.

Voltage[edit]
In a series circuit, the voltage is the sum of the voltage drops of the individual components (resistance units).

{\displaystyle V=V_{1}+V_{2}+\dots +V_{n}=I\left(R_{1}+R_{2}+\dots +R_{n}\right)}



Resistance units[edit]
The total resistance of two or more resistors connected in series is equal to the sum of their individual resistances:






R

total


=

R

s


=

R

1


+

R

2


+
⋯
+

R

n


.


{\displaystyle R_{\text{total}}=R_{\text{s}}=R_{1}+R_{2}+\cdots +R_{n}.}



Here, the subscript s in Rs denotes "series", and Rs denotes resistance in a series.

Conductance[edit]
Electrical conductance presents a reciprocal quantity to resistance. Total conductance of a series circuits of pure resistances, therefore, can be calculated from the following expression:






1

G

total




=


1

G

1




+


1

G

⋯
+


1

G

n




.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{G_{\text{total}}}}={\frac {1}{G_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{G_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{G_{n}}}.}


For a special case of two conductances in series, the total conductance is equal to:





G

total


=




G

1



G

2





G

1


+

G

2





.


{\displaystyle G_{\text{total}}={\frac {G_{1}G_{2}}{G_{1}+G_{2}}}.}



Inductors[edit]
Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in series is equal to the sum of their individual inductances:






L


t
o
t
a
l



=

L

1


+

L

2


+
⋯
+

L

n




{\displaystyle L_{\mathrm {total} }=L_{1}+L_{2}+\cdots +L_{n}}


However, in some situations, it is difficult to prevent adjacent inductors from influencing each other as the magnetic field of one device couples with the windings of its neighbors. This influence is defined by the mutual inductance M. For example, if two inductors are in series, there are two possible equivalent inductances depending on how the magnetic fields of both inductors influence each other.
When there are more than two inductors, the mutual inductance between each of them and the way the coils influence each other complicates the calculation. For a larger number of coils the total combined inductance is given by the sum of all mutual inductances between the various coils including the mutual inductance of each given coil with itself, which is termed self-inductance or simply inductance. For three coils, there are six mutual inductances 




M

{\displaystyle M_{12}}

, 




M

 and 




M

21




{\displaystyle M_{21}}

, 




M

31




{\displaystyle M_{31}}

 and 




M

32




{\displaystyle M_{32}}

. There are also the three self-inductances of the three coils: 




M

11




{\displaystyle M_{11}}

, 




M

22




{\displaystyle M_{22}}

 and 




M

33

{\displaystyle L_{\text{total}}=\left(M_{11}+M_{22}+M_{33}\right)+\left(M_{12}+M_{13}+M_{23}\right)+\left(M_{21}+M_{31}+M_{32}\right)}


By reciprocity, 




M

i
j




{\displaystyle M_{ij}}

 = 




M

j
i




{\displaystyle M_{ji}}

 so that the last two groups can be combined. The first three terms represent the sum of the self-inductances of the various coils. The formula is easily extended to any number of series coils with mutual coupling. The method can be used to find the self-inductance of large coils of wire of any cross-sectional shape by computing the sum of the mutual inductance of each turn of wire in the coil with every other turn since in such a coil all turns are in series.

Capacitors[edit]
See also: Capacitor § Networks
Capacitors follow the same law using the reciprocals. The total capacitance of capacitors in series is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual capacitances:







1

C

total




=


1

C

1

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{C_{\text{total}}}}={\frac {1}{C_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{C_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{C_{n}}}.}


Equivalently using elastance (the reciprocal of capacitance), the total series elastance equals the sum of each capacitor's elastance.

Switches[edit]
Two or more switches in series form a logical AND; the circuit only carries current if all switches are closed. See AND gate.

Cells and batteries[edit]
A battery is a collection of electrochemical cells. If the cells are connected in series, the voltage of the battery will be the sum of the cell voltages. For example, a 12 volt car battery contains six 2-volt cells connected in series. Some vehicles, such as trucks, have two 12 volt batteries in series to feed the 24-volt system.

Parallel circuits[edit]
Comparison of effective resistance, inductance and capacitance of two resistors, inductors and capacitors in series and parallel
If two or more components are connected in parallel, they have the same difference of potential (voltage) across their ends.  The potential differences across the components are the same in magnitude, and they also have identical polarities. The same voltage is applied to all circuit components connected in parallel. The total current is the sum of the currents through the individual components, in accordance with Kirchhoff's current law.

Voltage[edit]
In a parallel circuit, the voltage is the same for all elements.




V

⋯

{\displaystyle V=V_{1}=V_{2}=\dots =V_{n}}



Current[edit]
The current in each individual resistor is found by Ohm's law. Factoring out the voltage gives

⋯

.


{\displaystyle I_{\text{total}}=I_{1}+I_{2}+\cdots +I_{n}=V\left({\frac {1}{R_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{R_{n}}}\right).}



Resistance units[edit]
To find the total resistance of all components, add the reciprocals of the resistances 




R

i




{\displaystyle R_{i}}

 of each component and take the reciprocal of the sum. Total resistance will always be less than the value of the smallest resistance:







1

R

total




=


1

R

1




+


1

R

2

⋯
+


1

R

n




.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{\text{total}}}}={\frac {1}{R_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{R_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{R_{n}}}.}


For only two resistances, the unreciprocated expression is reasonably simple:





R

total


=




R

1



R

2





R

1


+

R

2





.


{\displaystyle R_{\text{total}}={\frac {R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}}.}


This sometimes goes by the mnemonic product over sum.
For N equal resistances in parallel, the reciprocal sum expression simplifies to:






1

R

total




=
N


1
R


.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R_{\text{total}}}}=N{\frac {1}{R}}.}


and therefore to:





R

total


=


R
N


.


{\displaystyle R_{\text{total}}={\frac {R}{N}}.}


To find the current in a component with resistance 




R

i




{\displaystyle R_{i}}

, use Ohm's law again:





I

i


=


V

R

i





.


{\displaystyle I_{i}={\frac {V}{R_{i}}}\,.}


The components divide the current according to their reciprocal resistances, so, in the case of two resistors,







I

1



I

2




=



R

2



R

1




.


{\displaystyle {\frac {I_{1}}{I_{2}}}={\frac {R_{2}}{R_{1}}}.}


An old term for devices connected in parallel is multiple, such as multiple connections for arc lamps.

Conductance[edit]
Since electrical conductance 



G


{\displaystyle G}

 is reciprocal to resistance, the expression for total conductance of a parallel circuit of resistors is simply:





G

total


=

G

1


+

G

2


+
⋯
+

G

n


.


{\displaystyle G_{\text{total}}=G_{1}+G_{2}+\cdots +G_{n}.}


The relations for total conductance and resistance stand in a complementary relationship: the expression for a series connection of resistances is the same as for parallel connection of conductances, and vice versa.

Inductors[edit]
Inductors follow the same law, in that the total inductance of non-coupled inductors in parallel is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual inductances:







1

L

total




=


1

L

1




+


1

L

2




+
⋯
+


1

L

n




.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{L_{\text{total}}}}={\frac {1}{L_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{L_{2}}}+\cdots +{\frac {1}{L_{n}}}.}


If the inductors are situated in each other's magnetic fields, this approach is invalid due to mutual inductance. If the mutual inductance between two coils in parallel is M, the equivalent inductor is:






1

L

total




=




L

1


+

L

2


−
2
M



L

1



L

2


−

M

2







{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{L_{\text{total}}}}={\frac {L_{1}+L_{2}-2M}{L_{1}L_{2}-M^{2}}}}


If 




L

1


=

L

2




{\displaystyle L_{1}=L_{2}}







L

total


=



L
+
M

2




{\displaystyle L_{\text{total}}={\frac {L+M}{2}}}


The sign of 



M


{\displaystyle M}

 depends on how the magnetic fields influence each other. For two equal tightly coupled coils the total inductance is close to that of every single coil. If the polarity of one coil is reversed so that M is negative, then the parallel inductance is nearly zero or the combination is almost non-inductive. It is assumed in the "tightly coupled" case M is very nearly equal to L. However, if the inductances are not equal and the coils are tightly coupled there can be near short circuit conditions and high circulating currents for both positive and negative values of M, which can cause problems.
More than three inductors become more complex and the mutual inductance of each inductor on each other inductor and their influence on each other must be considered. For three coils, there are three mutual inductances 




M

12




{\displaystyle M_{12}}

, 




M

13




{\displaystyle M_{13}}

 and 




M

23




{\displaystyle M_{23}}

. This is best handled by matrix methods and summing the terms of the inverse of the 



L


{\displaystyle L}

 matrix (3×3 in this case).
The pertinent equations are of the form:





v

=

∑

j



L

i
,
j





d

i

j

{\displaystyle v_{i}=\sum _{j}L_{i,j}{\frac {di_{j}}{dt}}}



Capacitors[edit]
The total capacitance of capacitors in parallel is equal to the sum of their individual capacitances:






C

total


=

C

1


+

C

2


+
⋯
+

C

n


.


{\displaystyle C_{\text{total}}=C_{1}+C_{2}+\cdots +C_{n}.}


The working voltage of a parallel combination of capacitors is always limited by the smallest working voltage of an individual capacitor.

Switches[edit]
Two or more switches in parallel form a logical OR; the circuit carries current if at least one switch is closed. See OR gate.

Cells and batteries[edit]
If the cells of a battery are connected in parallel, the battery voltage will be the same as the cell voltage, but the current supplied by each cell will be a fraction of the total current. For example, if a battery comprises four identical cells connected in parallel and delivers a current of 1 ampere, the current supplied by each cell will be 0.25 ampere. If the cells are not identical in voltage, cells with higher voltages will attempt to charge those with lower ones, potentially damaging them.
Parallel-connected batteries were widely used to power the valve filaments in portable radios. Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries (particularly laptop batteries) are often connected in parallel to increase the ampere-hour rating. Some solar electric systems have batteries in parallel to increase the storage capacity; a close approximation of total amp-hours is the sum of all amp-hours of in-parallel batteries.

Combining conductances[edit]
From Kirchhoff's circuit laws the rules for combining conductance can be deducted. For two conductances 




G

1




{\displaystyle G_{1}}

 and 




G

2




{\displaystyle G_{2}}

 in parallel, the voltage across them is the same and from Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) the total current is





I

eq


=

I

1


+

I

.


{\displaystyle I_{\text{eq}}=I_{1}+I_{2}.}


Substituting Ohm's law for conductances gives

{\displaystyle G_{\text{eq}}V=G_{1}V+G_{2}V}


and the equivalent conductance will be,

G

.


{\displaystyle G_{\text{eq}}=G_{1}+G_{2}.}


For two conductances 




G

{\displaystyle G_{1}}

 and 




G

2




{\displaystyle G_{2}}

 in series the current through them will be the same and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law says that the voltage across them is the sum of the voltages across each conductance, that is,





V

eq


=

V

+

V

.


{\displaystyle V_{\text{eq}}=V_{1}+V_{2}.}


Substituting Ohm's law for conductance then gives,

=

G

I

G

{\displaystyle {\frac {I}{G_{\text{eq}}}}={\frac {I}{G_{1}}}+{\frac {I}{G_{2}}}}


which in turn gives the formula for the equivalent conductance,

eq




=


1

G

+

G

2




.


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{G_{\text{eq}}}}={\frac {1}{G_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{G_{2}}}.}

{\displaystyle G_{\text{eq}}={\frac {G_{1}G_{2}}{G_{1}+G_{2}}}.}

Applications[edit]
A common application of series circuit in consumer electronics is in batteries, where several cells connected in series are used to obtain a convenient operating voltage. Two disposable zinc cells in series might power a flashlight or remote control at 3 volts; the battery pack for a hand-held power tool might contain a dozen lithium-ion cells wired in series to provide 48 volts.
Series circuits were formerly used for lighting in electric multiple units trains.  For example, if the supply voltage was 600 volts there might be eight 70-volt bulbs in series (total 560 volts) plus a resistor to drop the remaining 40 volts.  Series circuits for train lighting were superseded, first by motor-generators, then by solid state devices.
Series resistance can also be applied to the arrangement of blood vessels within a given organ.  Each organ is supplied by a large artery, smaller arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins arranged in series. The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, as expressed by the following equation: Rtotal = Rartery + Rarterioles + Rcapillaries. The largest proportion of resistance in this series is contributed by the arterioles.[3]
Parallel resistance is illustrated by the circulatory system. Each organ is supplied by an artery that branches off the aorta. The total resistance of this parallel arrangement is expressed by the following equation: 1/Rtotal = 1/Ra + 1/Rb + ... + 1/Rn. Ra, Rb, and Rn are the resistances of the renal, hepatic, and other arteries respectively. The total resistance is less than the resistance of any of the individual arteries.[3]

John Clifford Christopherson (1 June 1909 – 8 January 1999) was an English cricketer and cricket administrator. Christopherson played first-class cricket for Cambridge University and for Kent County Cricket Club.[1]
Christopherson was born in 1909 in Blackheath in metropolitan Kent.[2] He attended Uppingham School where he played in the Cricket XI from 1925 to 1928.[3] He went up to Cambridge University and played in the 1929 Freshmen's match and in trial matches as well as for Kent's Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship in 1930 before making his first-class cricket debut for Kent against Derbyshire in May 1931.[3]
Later the same month Christopherson made his first-class debut for Cambridge, playing eight matches during the season and winning a cricket Blue in the University Match.[3][4] He went on to make a total of 16 first-class appearances. As well as a total of three for Kent, he also appeared four times for HDG Leveson-Gower's XI and once for Free Foresters.[3][4]
In club cricket Christopherson played for Reigate Priory, setting a club-record highest score of 261 in 1931.[2] He was on the General Committee at Surrey County Cricket Club for more than 20 years before he died at Walton-on-the-Hill in Surrey in 1999 aged 89.[2]

The Ayden Aces were a minor league baseball team based in Ayden, North Carolina. In 1937 and 1938, the Aces played as exclusively as members of the Class D level Coastal Plain League, hosting home games at the Ayden High School Park.


History[edit]
The Ayden "Aces" moniker was first used by a semi–pro team that played in a league named the Coastal Plain League prior to minor league play.[1][2]
Minor league baseball began in Ayden, North Carolina in 1937. The 1937 Ayden Aces became charter members of the eight–team Class D level Coastal Plain League. Ayden joined the Goldsboro Goldbugs, Greenville Greenies, Kinston Eagles, New Bern Bears, Snow Hill Billies, Tarboro Combs and Williamston Martins in playing the first season of Class D level baseball for the league.[3][4]
Beginning Coastal Plain League play on May 6, 1937, the Ayden Aces finished the regular season in 5th place. The Aces ended the season with a record of 47–46, finishing in fifth place in the eight–team Coastal Plain League. The Ayden managers in 1937 were Nick Harrison and Alfred "Monk" Joyner, as the Aces finished 12.5 games behind the first place Snow Hill Billies in the final standings. The Aces did not qualify for the playoffs, won by Snow Hill.[5][6][7][8] Player/manager Monk Joyner won the league Triple Crown, leading the Coastal Plain League with a .380 batting average, 24 home runs and 97 RBI.[8]
In their final season of play, the Ayden Aces finished last in the 1938 eight–team Coastal Plain League standings. Playing under managers Frank Sidle, Bill Herring, Jim Tatum and Frank Rodgers, the Aces finished the 1938 season with a record of 38–76, placing eighth in the Coastal Plain League. The Aces finished 26.0 games behind the first place New Bern Bears in the final standings and did not qualify for the playoffs. The Ayden minor league franchise permanently folded following the 1938 season.[9][10][11][8] Aces player Doyt Morris won the Coastal Plain league batting championship, leading the league in batting average, hitting .377. [8]
The Aces were replaced by the Wilson Tobs franchise in the 1939 Coastal Plain League. Ayden, North Carolina has not hosted another minor league team.[8][12]

The ballpark[edit]
The Ayden Aces teams were noted to have played home minor league games at the Ayden High School Park. The ballpark is still in use by the Ayden-Grifton High School teams.[13][14]

Saint George Killing the Dragon, also known as Saint George and the Dragon is a tempera painting by the Catalan artist Bernat Martorell, painted c. 1434 – c. 1435. It depicts the famous legend of St. George and the Dragon in which the Christian knight, St. George, rescues a princess from a dragon.[1][2]


History[edit]
The painting was likely commissioned by the Catalonian government as an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. George, in the Government Palace of Catalonia in Barcelona. The four side-panels that would likely have also been fixed to the altar, depict the martyrdom of St. George, and are currently on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The painting was most probably painted some time between 1434 and 1435.[1][2]
Starting in 1867, the painting changed hands numerous times until it was eventually sold to Charles Deering in 1917. In 1921, the painting was loaned to the Art Institute of Chicago by Deering. Then, in 1924, the painting went to Deering's daughters, Marion Deering-McCormick and Barbara Deering-Danielson, who donated the work to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1933.[2]

Description[edit]
The work, painted in International Gothic style, depicts Saint George's legend in the setting of Catalonia, Spain, during the first half of the 15th century. The painting was initially made as the centerpiece of an altar, and was surrounded by four, smaller, narrative panels.
The scene in the foreground shows St. George on a stark white horse, about to defeat the dragon by stabbing it with his lance. St. George is depicted in black armor with a halo above his head. The saint's expression appears calm and stoic in contrast to the dragon's, which seems angry and excited. The dragon has dark-green scales, is winged, and has red eyes. The dragon's scales, and the armor and halo on St. George are decorated with raised stucco. The ground is shown to be littered with lizards, skulls, and other bones.
In the immediate background, the princess stands praying behind them; she is dressed in a pink robe lined with ermine fur, with a large golden crown above her red-golden hair. In the distance, on the other side of a valley, the princess' parents and common people can be seen to be watching apprehensively from atop a castle. The castle is surrounded by a serene and intricate countryside.[2][3]
In the style typical of International Gothic works, the ground rises steeply behind the scene but, unusually, it does not stretch behind the entire painting. Rather, there is a clear separation between the foreground and the background. While the background maintains the decorative nature and continuity of color typical of International Gothic backgrounds, the foreground is more expressive, and contains gradations of color and lighting.[3]
The main axis of the composition can be placed by the shaft of St. George's lance and an imaginary vertical line drawn through the eyes of the dragon, the horse, and the princess. The two lines create a "V" shape that outlines the castle in the background.[3]

Frank Alexander Wetmore (June 18, 1886 – December 7, 1978) was an American ornithologist and avian paleontologist.[1][2][3]  He was the sixth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was also an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the United States National Academy of Sciences.[4][5]

Early life and education[edit]
The son of a physician, Frank Alexander Wetmore was born in North Freedom, Wisconsin. Developing an interest in birds at an early age, he made his first field journal entry (a pelican seen while on vacation in 1894) at the age of eight. By 1900, Wetmore published his first paper "My Experience with a Red-headed Woodpecker," in the magazine Bird-Lore. To further his education Wetmore enrolled at the University of Kansas in 1905. During his studies there he did a stint as an assistant in the University Museum, under the direction of Charles D. Bunker. Alexander Wetmore later received his BA from the University of Kansas in 1912; finally receiving his MS in 1916 and his  PhD in 1920 from George Washington University.[6] Wetmore began federal service in 1910, working for the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture. In 1915, he researched the use of lead shot in causing death in waterfowl. His paleontological research led to his work on  the fossil birds Palaeochenoides mioceanus and  Nesotrochis debooyi.
From April 1923 to July 1924, Wetmore was the lead scientist of the Tanager Expedition, a series of five biological surveys to study the flora, fauna and geology of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Johnston Atoll and Wake Island. In 1924, Wetmore joined the Smithsonian Institution as the superintendent of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.[7]  In 1925, Wetmore was appointed assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, becoming secretary between 1945 and 1952. In 1929 he participated in the Pinchot South Sea Expedition. In 1939 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union
He wrote A Systematic Classification for the Birds of the World (1930, revised in 1951[8] and 1960).  This Wetmore Order received widespread acceptance, remaining popular until the end of the twentieth century. From 1944 to 1946 Wetmore served as the 15th president of The Explorers Club. Between 1946 and 1966 Wetmore made annual trips to Panama to study and collect specimens of the birds of the Isthmus.  His 4-volume magnum opus, Birds of the Republic of Panama, was published by the Smithsonian between 1965 and 1984, the last volume appearing posthumously.[9] He also served on the boards of trustees of Science Service, now known as Society for Science & the Public, from 1946 to 1953, and of the National Geographic Society, where he served successively as vice chairman, acting chairman, and chairman emeritus of the Committee for Research and Exploration, from 1933 until his death, in his final years as a trustee emeritus.
Several taxa of birds have been named in his honor, including the Cretaceous genus Alexornis and the tanagers Wetmorethraupis sterrhopteron and Buthraupis wetmorei. Insects, mammals, amphibians, mollusks, and one plant (an Argentinian cactus), as well as a bridge in Panama and the Wetmore Glacier in the Antarctic, have also been named after him.[10] Wetmore is commemorated in the scientific names of one species and two subspecies of reptiles: Pholidoscelis wetmorei, Uromacer frenatus wetmorei, and Anolis brevirostris wetmorei.[11]
In 1953 he married Annie Beatrice van der Biest Thielan, who became guarantor of the American Ornithologists' Union after his death in 1978.[12] His papers and an oral history interview are held at the Smithsonian Institution.[13]

Vampire Dog is a 2012 Canadian family film directed by Geoff Anderson and starring Collin MacKechnie, Julia Sarah Stone, Amy Matysio, Ron Pederson and Jodi Sadowsky. The vampire dog (Fang) is voiced by Norm Macdonald.


Plot[edit]
In Transylvania, a woman in her kitchen cooks a jelly pudding. A dog suddenly appears from nowhere and eats the pudding when she leaves the kitchen. The woman witnesses the dog suddenly disappear. Back at home, the dog's owner questions who should look after the pet after his death.
In Lugosi County, somewhere in North America, twelve-year-old Ace and his mother Susan arrive at their new home. Ace plays drums well but suffers from stage fright. Susan gets work as an additional music teacher at the local high school which will be closing after the current year.
Though the current music teacher, who is also the school's principal, Barry Hickman, discourages students and doubts their skills, Susan thinks the right approach will help the kids. She involves the school in a talent show, which, if they win, will save the school from closure. Hickman assigns Ace to play drums, but Ace panics and falls off his stool. The other students record this; since Ace is also the son of the new teacher, he is teased and ostracized. Skylar befriends Ace, though she tries to hide it from the other students.
Susan gets a letter from a notary: her late husband's father has died, and Ace has inherited his old dog, Fang. Later, a trunk is delivered; inside is apparently a regular dog.
A television program shows an interview regarding a woman from Transylvania and the incident with the dog. Doctor Warhol sees the show, and is now sure: the legend of the vampire dog is true. Warhol is sure the DNA of the vampire dog will lead to a solution to create a cream that will stop the aging of human skin. She orders her assistant Frank to search for the vampire dog.
The next day, Fang is outside, tied onto a long string. When Ace arrives from school, Fang hides in the shade under the deck. Once inside, Fang starts talking and blames Ace for putting him in the sun: he cannot go out in the sunlight. Ace faints, and Fang drags him to the couch.
After Ace awakens, Fang explains that he is a 600-year-old vampire dog living on jelly pudding. Besides talking, Fang can hypnotize and run at almost the speed of light. Ace forbids Fang to tell his mother - she might faint and hurt herself. He decides not to tell his mother the dog needs jelly pudding to survive, so he smuggles Fang to school each day so the dog can seek pudding in the schools' kitchen and cafeteria.
Meanwhile, Skylar knows the truth about Fang. Fang tells the kids how he turned into a vampire dog 600 years ago when the legendary count Vlad tried to attack the great-great-great-...-great-parents of Ace. Fang attacked the vampire, but was bitten, turning him into a vampire. After he became immortal, the dog stayed with the family. After becoming a vampire, Fang ate mostly horse hoofs until discovering jelly pudding. Skylar, a genius in chemistry, knows the reason: jelly pudding contains gelatin, which contains collagen, which for Fang, is a substitute for haemoglobin. Skylar wonders if she can find a way for Fang to walk in the sunlight.
Doctor Warhol and Frank have attempted to kidnap the dog and failed. They then scheme to buy up all the gelatin in town to lure the dog but fail again. Not much later, Fang is found by the school caretaker and brought to a pet shelter. His mother grounds Ace for taking the dog to school and refuses to get his dog back because she sees her son as an embarrassment and tries to save her career. Despite being grounded, Ace and Skylar visit the pet shelter to save Fang from another kidnap attempt by Warhol and Frank. The talent show takes place that evening. Susan's class performance is stopped by Hickman, exposing that the drummer is using a drum computer to cheat. Warhol bribed Hickman and the drummer (his nephew Murray Arbuckle) to doom the school so that she could build her chemical company on the land. The contest jury rules that the group can continue if another drummer can be found. Ace appears and plays drums without his stage fright. His school wins and is saved. Susan is proud of her son. The corrupt Hickman is fired, while Arbuckle is assigned to the instrument triangle instead of drums. Ace becomes a very popular boy. Skylar finds out Fang only needs to take some drug against sun allergy. Warhol and Frank are arrested by police and declared lunatics after claiming Fang is a vampire dog.

Production[edit]
The film was shot on locations in Regina and Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan,[2] Canada, and is Geoff Anderson's debut as feature film director.[3]  It was one of the last films to take advantage of the Saskatchewan Film Employment Tax Credit; the production company announced it was moving to Alberta due to the end of the credit.[4]

Releases[edit]
Vampire Dog was released on DVD,[5] for streaming, and download on-demand in 2012.[6][7][8]

Reception[edit]
The Common Sense Media review in 2012 stated that the film had "anti-bullying messages weighed down by predictable plot", further calling it "logic impaired", and giving it two (of five) stars. In its advice to parents, it cited "silly slapstick action with nothing scary and no serious consequences", and rated the film as suitable for seven-year-olds.[1]
Couch Critics reviewer Sarah Jehnzen approved the film for all families, but gave the film two (of five) stars, stating that the film lacked "laughs" until the blooper scenes, and that the two plot lines "didn't mesh well."[9]

AwardsAir Medal
Charles Donald Albury (October 12, 1920 – May 23, 2009) was an American military aviator who participated in both atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was the co-pilot of the United States Army Air Forces B-29 bomber known as the Bockscar during the mission that dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.[1] The bombing of Nagasaki killed an estimated 40,000 people instantly, and led to Japan's unconditional surrender on August 14, 1945, ending World War II.[1]


Early life[edit]
Albury was born in 1920 at his parents' home in Miami, Florida.[1] The Miami Police Department building currently stands on the site of Albury's birthplace, as of 2009.[1]

World War II[edit]
Albury enrolled at the University of Miami's engineering school, but dropped out before he completed his bachelor's degree in order to enlist in the United States Army during World War II.[1] He was one of three pilots assigned under the command of Captain Charles Sweeney to test the XB-29 and YB-29 delivered to Eglin Air Force Base in September 1943. Albury joined (now Major) Sweeney at Wendover Air Force Base in Utah where he and Sweeney were invited by Colonel Paul Tibbets to join what would become the nucleus of the 509th Composite Group in September 1944. (The 509th Composite Group was activated December 17, 1944.) Tibbets initially organized two air crews: one headed by himself with Robert A. Lewis as co-pilot (cockpit crew of the Enola Gay during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), the other headed by Sweeney with Albury as the co-pilot. Lewis and Albury acted as pilots and crew commanders for their respective planes when Tibbets and/or Sweeney were not flying.[1][2]Cpt. C.D. Albury besides of Bockscar and aircrew C-15.
Atomic bombing of Hiroshima[edit]
On August 6, 1945, Albury witnessed the first atomic bombing of Hiroshima as pilot of the instrument observation plane, The Great Artiste, which accompanied the Enola Gay commanded by Tibbets.[1][3] Albury measured the levels of radioactivity and magnitude of the atomic bomb from his plane.[1] He would later state in an interview with Time magazine, "When Tibbets dropped the bomb, we dropped our instruments and made our left turn. Then this bright light hit us and the top of that mushroom cloud was the most terrifying, but also the most beautiful, thing you've ever seen in your life. Every color in the rainbow seemed to be coming out of it."[1]

Atomic bombing of Nagasaki[edit]
On August 9, 1945, just three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, Sweeney's crew, with Albury as co-pilot, took off in the B-29 Superfortress, nicknamed the Bockscar, which would drop the atomic bomb known as the "Fat Man" on the city of Nagasaki.[1][4] The attack was delayed by cloud cover until the crew located a hole in the clouds.[1] The Bockscar dropped the 10,200-pound "Fat Man" on the city of Nagasaki, instantly killing 40,000 people. The bomb exploded in the Urakami Valley where two major munition factories were located.[1] An additional 35,000 Japanese citizens would succumb from radiation sickness and other injuries in the aftermath of the bombing.[1]
Immediately after the formal surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, Albury flew with Tibbetts, Sweeney and close to twenty other members of their aircrews to Japan. The group eventually reached Nagasaki and witnessed on the ground the destruction caused by the atomic bomb.[5]
Albury stated repeatedly during his life that he did not have any remorse for the attack or his role in the attack on Nagasaki, noting that many more lives would have been lost if the United States had launched a full invasion of mainland Japan.[1]

Post-war life[edit]
At the end of World War II, Albury moved to Coral Gables, Florida with his wife, Roberta.[1] He chose a career as a commercial airline pilot for the now defunct Eastern Airlines[1] and flew during their 1989 strike.[citation needed] He later became the co-manager of Eastern's Airbus A300 training program. He later moved to a house in Hunter's Creek (south Orlando) where he lived until his death.
Charles Donald Albury died on May 23, 2009, at a hospital in Orlando, Florida, at the age of 88. He had suffered from congestive heart failure for several years before his death.[1] He appeared in the Smithsonian Networks program Smithsonian Channel's War Stories, "The Men Who Brought the Dawn", in 1995, giving his recollections and reflections on the two atomic bomb missions.

"Late at Night" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song by American rapper Roddy Ricch. It was released on June 4, 2021, through Atlantic Records and Bird Vision, as the lead single from his second studio album, Live Life Fast. The song serves as his first solo single in more than a year. Ricch wrote the song alongside its producer Mustard and co-producer Gylttryp.[1] The song debuted at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 40 on the UK Singles Chart in June 2021.


Background[edit]
Prior to the release of the song, Roddy Ricch had worked with producer Mustard three times as two credited artists: Mustard's 2019 single "Ballin'", Ricch's 2020 single "High Fashion", and American singer Ty Dolla Sign's 2020 song "Real Life". On all the songs, Mustard is the producer and Gylttryp is the co-producer even though the latter has never been credited as an artist.[2]

Release and promotion[edit]
On May 10, 2021, Roddy Ricch previewed the song through his Twitter account.[3] He announced the release date in a now-deleted post on Instagram on May 24, 2021, also revealing that Mustard would be producing the song. The cover art for the song was revealed on June 2, 2021.[4]

Music video[edit]
The official music video of the song premiered alongside the song on June 4, 2021.[5] The accompanying visuals see him "ride Ferris wheels, teleport to gallery parties, and turn into a werewolf". It stars American actress and model Karrueche Tran as Ricch's love interest.[6] There is also a reference to American singer Michael Jackson's 1983 song "Thriller".[7]

Mad Men season 4List of episodes
"Public Relations" is the season premiere of the fourth season of the American television drama series Mad Men, and the 40th overall episode of the series. It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner, and directed by Phil Abraham. It originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 25, 2010. The episode takes place in November 1964, as the advertisement agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has just started up, and Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is struggling with his divorce. The agency partners are concerned about the narrow breadth of their client base, which is not helped by Don coming across as less than sympathetic in an interview with a trade magazine. Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) attempts a viral marketing stunt to bring back a disgruntled client, with unexpected repercussions. Meanwhile, Don's ex-wife Betty (January Jones) is struggling to fit in with her new family, and Don encounters problems in his romantic life.
"Public Relations" was heavily promoted in the weeks leading up to its airing, with an endorsement by President Obama and product tie-in by Mattel toys helping with publicity. Weiner expressed displeasure with what he considered a media revelation of plot details, though other journalists called his objections unwarranted. "Public Relations" was critically acclaimed by television critics, who expressed that the series returned to form. Upon airing, the episode was viewed by 2.92 million viewers and attained a 0.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings.


Plot[edit]
In November 1964, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) is being interviewed by a reporter from Advertising Age and declines to speak about his personal life. As a result, he comes across as arrogant and inscrutable in the published story - a fact that senior partners Roger Sterling (John Slattery) and Bert Cooper (Robert Morse) lament, as they had hoped the interview would act as advertising for the company. One effect of the bad publicity is brought home just after Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) has sold a Jai Alai special to ABC. It must be pulled because the client, Pete Campbell's (Vincent Kartheiser) college friend, Horace Cook Jr. (nicknamed "Ho Ho"), fires the agency because Don did not mention the client in his interview. Because of the agency's narrow client base, the loss is financially detrimental. Bert suggests Don do an interview with The Wall Street Journal to make amends, but Don demurs. Meanwhile, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) comes up with an idea to regain the Sugarberry Ham account. She hires two actresses to fight over a ham in a grocery store. The plan goes awry when the fight turns real and one of the women presses charges against the other for assault, and Peggy has to ask Don for bail and hush money. Don disapproves of the stunt (which was carried out behind his back), but Peggy points out that they did retain the account. Peggy is shown to have a friendly working relationship with Joey, a new employee.
Don settles in as a bachelor after his divorce from Betty (January Jones). Roger sets him up on a date with Bethany, a friend of his wife Jane, who is a petite blonde, like Betty. After the date, Bethany (Anna Camp) expresses interest in seeing Don again, but rejects his sexual advances. On Thanksgiving Day, Don spends time with a prostitute, and Betty has problems fitting in with the family of her new husband Henry Francis (Christopher Stanley). At Thanksgiving dinner with his family, Betty's daughter Sally (Kiernan Shipka) complains about the food. The childish action blows up into a scene when Betty yells at Sally, treats her brusquely, and causes problems by forcing food into Sally's mouth. Henry's mother later privately expresses displeasure with her son's new wife, observing that her children are clearly scared of her. However, in bed, Henry and Betty get along. The next day, Don picks up his two oldest children for an overnight visit, and Don is disappointed he can't see baby Gene, whom Betty sent to Carla's. Betty curtly tells Don to have the kids back by 9. When he returns the next evening, the house is empty and he has to wait for Betty and Henry to come back. When they return, well past 9 pm, an argument ensues about the house; Don, at his accountant's instigation, angrily reminds them they were supposed to be out a month ago, and he demands they either buy him out, pay him rent, or leave. A minor argument later sparks between Henry and Betty when Henry agrees with Don's point. Betty stubbornly reiterates that they will leave on her timetable, not Don's.
A different client, Jantzen swimwear, asks for help to maintain a family-friendly image in a field where bikinis are becoming more common and more revealing. They insist they do not sell "bikinis" (which they liken to underwear) but rather two-piece bathing suits. Don tries to sell a pitch wherein the model's breasts are obscured by the slogan, "So well built, we can't show you the second floor". The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risqué, and Don - exasperated by the clients' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room. As they leave, he finally agrees to do the interview with The Wall Street Journal. As the episode ends, Don is seen telling the journalist the swashbuckling story of how he instigated the formation of SCDP by having Lane Pryce (Jared Harris) fire them.

Production[edit]
"Public Relations" was heavily advertised in the weeks prior to its broadcasting.[1][2] Producers of the series' entered into a cross-promotional deal with Banana Republic, and Janie Bryant, the show's costume designer, collaborated with QVC to design a clothing line inspired by mod subculture.[3][4] President Barack Obama, a fan of Mad Men, had sent series creator Matthew Weiner a letter to express his admiration.[5] Attention was further boosted by the release of a series of Barbie dolls based on characters from the show by toy manufacturer Mattel.[6] A week prior to the premiere of the episode, recurring cast member Crista Flanagan (who plays Lois Sadler) posed nude for Playboy.[7]

"Public Relations" was screened at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was televised.
Screenings for the episode were shown in Los Angeles, California on July 21, 2010,[8] and again five days later at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was televised nationwide.[9] The designs of costumes were altered, according to Bryant, to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s. In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, she teased: "My characters are in an office environment in New York; it's very different from what was going on in London at the time. But there will be some progression in their costumes, just like in real life.[10]
The press were given advanced copies of the episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information.[11][12]  He continued: "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and it was nice to get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.[11]
"Public Relations" features several references to media, music, film, and other pop culture phenomena. Peggy and a coworker engage in a humorous conversation, in which they subsequently refer to "A Dear John and Marsha Letter" by Stan Freberg.[13] The episode depicts the growing acceptance of the bikini in mainstream popular culture in the United States during the 1960s.[14]

Reception[edit]
"Public Relations" first aired in the United States on July 25, 2010, on AMC. It was watched by 2.92 million viewers, and attained a 0.9 rating in the 18-49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings.[15] Total viewership increased 5% from the previous season premiere, "Out of Town", which was viewed by 2.76 million viewers.[16] In contrast, ratings for "Public Relations" were constant to that of "Out of Town".[17] Likewise, total viewership was significantly up from the previous episode, "Shut the Door. Have a Seat", which attained 2.32 million viewers.[18]

Critics appreciated the character development of Don Draper (Jon Hamm) and Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss)
The episode was critically acclaimed by television critics. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times opined, "Those cues also hold out the promise that the coming season will once again pivot the story on the workplace. It’s where Mad Men started and where it was best. A fresh start at the rat race is just what the series needs."[13] Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an "amazing" rating. Goldman felt that it started the season on a strong note, writing, "It's a clever beat to start out with, leading into a strong premiere that quickly drops us into what can be described as Mad Men 2.0."[19] Praise was also directed to the musical selection of the episode, which Goldman described as excellent.[19] In concurrence, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave the episode an 'A' grade, praising the character development of Don Draper and Peggy Olson.[20] Expressing that she had more confidence, Phipps said of Peggy: "[She's] the person who's changed most notably over the last year. She drinks at work like the boys and [...] goes into a Don-like trance as she searches for inspiration. She bosses Joey around and tells him when he’s gone too far. And she’s not afraid to get creative to sell ham and wants credit for her idea, even if it encounters a minor disaster along the way. Most significantly, she’s standing up to Don at every turn now. He bullies her in front of her fiancé but hears about it later. And she provides a devastating mixture of admiration and chiding when she reminds Don that everyone at SCDP is there because of him and out of a desire to make him happy."[20] Similarly, James Poniewozik of Time praised the performance of Elisabeth Moss, exclaiming that "she has come a long way."[21]
TV Fanatic's Dan Forcella felt that "Public Relations" was a fantastic episode, and asserted: "All in all it was a great start to the fourth season of Mad Men."[22] In conclusion, Forcella gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars.[22] The Wall Street Journal journalist Cheryl Berman opined that the episode had a "little bit of everything we love about Mad Men."[23] William Bradley wrote in The Huffington Post that the series got off to "a cracking start" with "Public Relations".[24] Similarly, Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News found it to be "a very good episode and a very promising restart", after what he considered a disappointing third season.[25]

Mount Hood Village is the name of a census-designated place (CDP) within the Mount Hood Corridor in Clackamas County, Oregon, United States. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 4,864.[3] The Villages at Mount Hood is the name of the combined government of several of the communities encompassed by the CDP and is a separate entity.[citation needed]

The Villages at Mount Hood is the common quasi-government of the unincorporated communities of the Mount Hood Corridor, and includes Brightwood, Welches, Wemme, Zigzag, and Rhododendron. Residents approved its formation in May 2006.
The Villages at Mount Hood was the first established village under Clackamas County's "Complete Communities" ordinance, which allows unincorporated communities to form quasi-governments that allow them to have more direct control regarding the issues and activities that affect them.
According to the village's official website, the communities united to form the village because the Oregon Department of Transportation required that the towns create a "governmental agency" in order to continue getting grants for the growing Mount Hood Express bus system. The "Complete Communities" ordinance makes villages and hamlets official agencies of the county.

Geography[edit]
The CDP includes most of Brightwood, Wemme, Welches, Zigzag, and Rhododendron. Most of the area is immediately north or south of U.S. Route 26, though a spur south into parts of Welches and a spur north along East Lolo Pass Road is also included.[citation needed]

Peter von Zahn (29 January 1913 – 26 July 2001) was a German author, film maker, and journalist.
Born in Chemnitz as a son of an officer, he grew up in Dresden and studied law, history, and philosophy. He was drafted at the beginning of World War II. After the war, he was one of the founders of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR). For three years, he managed the NWDR Studio in Düsseldorf where he introduced Anglo-Saxon style journalism with self-critical irony.
In 1951, he went to the United States as a foreign correspondent. He worked until a very advanced age and produced over 3000 radio shows and 1000 television films.
He received many awards such as the Adolf-Grimme-Preis (3), the DAG-Fernsehpreis in Silver and Gold, the Goldene Kamera and the Bavarian TV Award, and is considered the standard for subsequent radio and television journalism. The State of Hamburg promoted him in 1995 to a Professor honoris causa.

flowers and buds
Eucalyptus oxymitra, commonly known as the sharp-capped mallee,[2] is a species of mallee that is endemic to remote parts of Central Australia. It has rough bark on the trunk, smooth greyish bark above, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white to pale yellow flowers and hemispherical fruit.


Description[edit]
Eucalyptus oxymitra is a mallee that typically grows to a height of 2–4 m (6 ft 7 in – 13 ft 1 in) and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, imperfectly shed ribbons of greyish brown bark on the trunk, smooth grey to cream-coloured bark on the branches. Young plant and coppice regrowth have greyish blue, egg-shaped leaves that are 40–110 mm (1.6–4.3 in) long and 25–45 mm (0.98–1.77 in) wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull, greyish green on both sides, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, 55–125 mm (2.2–4.9 in) long and 15–40 mm (0.59–1.57 in) wide, tapering to a petiole 12–28 mm (0.47–1.10 in) long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle 7–15 mm (0.28–0.59 in) long, the individual buds on pedicels 2–7 mm (0.079–0.276 in) long. Mature buds are oval, 11–16 mm (0.43–0.63 in) long and 6–13 mm (0.24–0.51 in) wide with a prominently beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from October to January and the flowers are white to pale yellow. The fruit is a woody, hemispherical to shortened spherical capsule 5–12 mm (0.20–0.47 in) long and 10–21 mm (0.39–0.83 in) wide with the valves protruding above the rim.[2][3][4]

Taxonomy[edit]
Eucalyptus oxymitra was first formally described in 1936 by William Blakely in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The type material was collected by Ralph Tate in 1894 during the Horn expedition.[5][6] The specific epithet (oxymitra) is from ancient Greek, meaning "sharp cap", referring to the long, narrow operculum.[7]

Distribution and habitat[edit]
Sharp-capped mallee grows in open shrubland in undulating sand and on sand dunes in the central Australian ranges of the far east of Western Australian, south-western Northern Territory and north-western South Australia.[4]

Conservation status[edit]
This eucalypt is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.[2]

Fares for fixed-route and Flex trips are $2, with day and monthly passes available. Reduced fares are available for people over 65 and with disabilities. Fares can be paid with cash or with Wave smart card or mobile app, or RIde fares are $4.[5]

Routes[edit]
An R-Line bus in downtown Providence
RIPTA operates 59 year-round bus routes: 50 local routes, one rapid route, and eight limited-service express routes. Most of RIPTA's fixed-route bus lines are centered on three major hubs: Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket/Central Falls station in Pawtucket, and Gateway Center in Newport. 
The R-Line is a limited-stop "Rapid Bus" route between Cranston and Pawtucket via Providence. It has some bus rapid transit (BRT) characteristics, including frequent service and transit signal priority, but runs in mixed traffic without dedicated lanes. Nine routes combine to provide five-minute-or-better headways in the Downtown Transit Connector between Providence station and the Hospital District. This corridor has BRT elements including limited stops, bus shelters with real-time information, bus/bike lanes, and signal priority.[6]
In addition to fixed-route services, RIPTA also provides Flex Service service, primarily settled around less populated areas in the state. These demand-responsive routes have fixed schedules for certain stops, but allow passengers to reserve trips within certain geographic areas.[7] RIPTA operates special services to connect with the seasonal Providence–Newport ferry, to provide seasonal access to South County beaches, and to serve Providence Public School District high schools.

History[edit]
RIPTA was created in 1964 by the Rhode Island General Assembly to supervise what had been a system of privately run bus and trolley systems. RIPTA began operating buses on July 1, 1966, inheriting services provided previously by the United Transit Company (formerly the Rhode Island Company.[8] Woonsocket local service was expanded in 2011 to allow residents, many of whom do not own cars, to reach shopping areas outside town.[9] R-Line service began on June 21, 2014.
The 1 Eddy/Hope/Benefit and 35 Rumford lines were the first two RIPTA routes with stops outside of Rhode Island's borders, as both routes end in a northern terminus at the South Attleboro MBTA station in Massachusetts.[10] RIPTA was required to seek federal permission before the extending the routes across state lines to South Attleboro in 2013.[10] Soon, the 32 and 34 were extended over the Massachusetts border to Seekonk Square. In August 2019, RIPTA added a third line running to Massachusetts, the 24x, an express line which includes stops in Fall River and Somerset that connect to Southeastern Regional Transit Authority lines.[11][12]
In November 2019, RIPTA received $8 million in federal funding to add additional hubs at the Community College of Rhode Island in Warwick and the University of Rhode Island in Kingston.[13]

Foekje DillemaFoekje Dillema in 1949Personal informationBorn(1926-09-26)26 September 1926Burum, NetherlandsDied5 December 2007(2007-12-05) (aged 81)Kollum, NetherlandsSportSportTrack and fieldEvent(s)100 m, 200 mDebuted13 June 1948Retired13 July 1950
Foekje Dillema (Dutch: [ˈfukjə ˈdɪləmaː]; 18 September 1926 – 5 December 2007) was a Dutch track and field athlete. She competed in sprinting where she was a rival of Fanny Blankers-Koen. When she refused a sex verification test, she was banned from competition by the International Association of Athletics Federations in 1950. After her death, it was determined that she was an intersex person.


Early life[edit]
Foekje Dillema was born on 18 September 1926 in Burum, Friesland in the Netherlands.[1]
She started running at the age of twelve.[1]

Career[edit]
1948[edit]
On 13 June 1948, Dillema debuted in Marsum, where the 21-year-old ran the 100 metres in 13 s.[2]
About a month later, she competed in the Dutch Championships in Eindhoven, where she ran 12.5 s in the 100 metres, resulting in 4th place in the heats, and 26.2 s in the 200 metres, resulting in 4th place in the final.[3][4]

1949[edit]
In 1949, Dillema did not compete in the Dutch Championships due to an injury of her thigh.[5]
Dillema was named "athlete of the match" in 1949 after winning the 100 metres and 200 metres race during a tournament in London. She was an important rival for another Dutch athlete Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals during the 1948 Summer Olympics and who was voted "Female Athlete of the Century" by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) in 1999.

1950[edit]

In 1950, Dillema was banned from competition for life by the IAAF. Dillema had refused to go to a mandatory sex test for the European championships in Brussels in August 1950. Dillema was the first subject of a mandatory gender verification. The IAAF introduced mandatory sex verification in 1950 and continued this practice until 1992. Dillema's national record of 24.1 seconds for the 200 metres was erased.[6]
On 13 July 1950, Dillema was stopped on her way to an international meeting in France by the Dutch athletics authorities and expelled for life from competition.[7]

After the ban[edit]
After Dillema was banned from competition, she returned home to Friesland and did not leave her house for at least one year. She lived a quiet life in her home town afterwards and always refused to speak on the subject.[7]
She died on 5 December 2007 in Kollum, Netherlands.

Posthumous testing[edit]
Dillema, having the typical female phenotype, was designated female at birth, raised as a girl and lived her life as a woman. After her death a forensic test on body cells obtained from her clothing showed signs of a Y-chromosome in her DNA. She may have been a genetic mosaic, having cells with either 46,XX (female) or 46,XY (male) chromosomes, in approximately a one-to-one ratio, in her skin. The forensic report speculated that Dillema developed from a zygote with an XXY genotype that promptly divided into a half XX, half XY embryo through nondisjunction. Dillema was probably a 46XX/46XY woman.[8] This is also known as ovotesticular disorder of sex development (DSD) or true hermaphroditism.[9]
Her biographer Max Dohle concludes that Dillema, having a Y-chromosome, would never have been allowed to race in the last 45 years. The Barr body test (1966) as well as the test based on PCR (1992) scan for a Y-chromosome or an SRY-gene on the Y-chromosome. All female athletes with a Y-chromosome were expelled from competition from 1966 until 2011.[10]
Dohle concludes that Dillema was an intersex individual who had ovotesticular DSD. She had an operation on her glands in 1952. During the operation, testes or ovotestes were removed. The SRY-gene on the Y is the testis determining factor, so Dillema may have had infertile testes or ovotestes palpable in her groin. These ovotestes produce more testosterone than ovaries. Higher testosterone levels were considered unfair towards the competition, despite being an entirely natural feature of Dillema's physiology.

Rehabilitation[edit]
Sculpture in honor of Dillema by Ids Willemsma from 2014.
Shortly after Dillema's death, the director of the Royal Dutch Athletics Federation apologized to her family for the manner of her suspension and her personal best in the 200 metres was reinstated.[1]
In 2014, Ids Willemsma made a sculpture commemorating Dillema, currently installed in Leeuwarden.
In Amsterdam, a street was named after her.

Background[edit]
The Japanese Government established the Noguchi Prize in July 2006 as a new international medical research and services award.  Release of news about the planned prize was timed to mark the official visit to by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to Africa in May 2006.  The announcement of this new international prize also marked the 80th anniversary of Dr. Noguchi's death.[3]  The Prize aims to honor individuals with outstanding achievements in combating various infectious diseases in Africa or in establishing innovative medical service systems.[4]  As preliminary discussions about the award were disclosed, Koizumi explained that he hoped that many countries in the world would take an interest in this initiative.[5]
The awarding of the Noguchi Prize is planned to be a keynote event at the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD).  TICAD is a policy forum which Japan initiated in 1993. Other co-organizers are the United Nations Office of the Special Advisor on Africa (OSSA), the United Nations Development Program and the World Bank. Over time, the TICAD meetings have evolved into a major global framework to facilitate the implementation of initiatives for promoting African development under the dual principle of African "ownership" and international "partnership".[6]

At the first conference (TICAD-I), African countries and their development partners determined to do their utmost for African stability and prosperity.[6]
At TICAD-II, African countries and their development partners agreed on the "Tokyo Agenda for Action" (TAA), the strategic and action oriented guideline, with poverty reduction in Africa and its integration into the global economy as two fundamental goals.[6]
TICAD-III brought together some 1,000 delegates, including 23 heads of state and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. African countries and their development partners reviewed the achievements of the ten year TICAD process, discussed the future direction it should take in light of the latest developments on the African continent and in the international arena, and declared the "TICAD Tenth Anniversary Declaration".[6]
TICAD-IV aimed to mobilizes knowledge and resources of the international community in the core areas of boosting economic growth, ensuring human security and addressing environment and climate change issues. TICAD IV is scheduled to conclude with the adoption of the "Yokohama Declaration", outlining guiding principles and approaches to African development among TICAD stakeholders, as well as the "Yokohama Action Plan" and the "Yokohama Follow-up Mechanism", laying out a road map for action-oriented initiatives with measurable targets.[6]
Hideyo Noguchi[edit]

Hideyo Noguchi was a prominent Japanese bacteriologist who discovered the agent of syphilis in 1911.[7]  Noguchi's work would later attract the scrutiny of the committee evaluating nominations for the Nobel Prize in Medicine.[8]  The Nobel Foundation archives have been only recently opened for public inspection; and what was once only speculation is now confirmed.  In 1914, for example, Dr. Ikutaro Hirai of Kyoto nominated Noguchi for the Nobel Prize in Medicine because of his bacteriological and biological works.[9]
In 1918, Noguchi traveled extensively in Central America and South America to do research for a vaccine for yellow fever.  He traveled to Africa to try to confirm his findings; and he wanted to test the hypothesis that yellow fever was caused by spirochaete bacteria instead of a virus. While working in Accra, Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana), he was himself struck down by the yellow fever virus.[10] His last words were reported to have been, "I don't understand."[11]
After his death, Noguchi's body was returned to the United States; but the Noguchi Prize is arguably poised to become a more meaningful memorial than his modest grave marker in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery.[12]

Inaugural award in 2008[edit]
The first laureates of the Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize, like Noguchi himself, are both medical doctors with a career-long interest in epidemiology and public health. They are Dr. Brian Greenwood and Dr. Miriam Were.[1]  For the honorees, the Prize represents both an acknowledgment of their past accomplishments and an investment in their prospective contributions in the years ahead.
Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda made the actual award presentation; and the Emperor and Empress were present at the 2008 ceremony along with a large number of African heads of state.[13]
The presentation ceremony and laureate lectures coincided with TICAD-IV, which was held in Yokohama in late May 2008.[14]  This year's conference venue was moved from Tokyo to Yokohama as another way of honoring the man after whom the prize was named.  In 1899, Dr. Noguchi worked at the Yokohama Port Quarantine Office as an assistant quarantine doctor.[15]
Prof. Greenwood, the Manson Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), was honored in the Medical Research category; and his laureate lecture topic was "Malaria elimination – Is it possible?"[1]
Prof. Were, chairperson of Kenya's National AIDS Control Council (NACC), chairperson of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) and formerly Professor of Community Health at the University of Nairobi School of Medicine, was honored in the Medical Services category; and her laureate lecture was "Potential for Improvement in Africa's Health Through Evidence and Persistence in the Spirit of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi."[1]
With significantly large money prizes attending this award, the Noguchi Prize already rivals the major established scientific awards.[16]  From the outset, the 2008 Noguchi Prizes—consisting of a citation, a medal and an honorarium of 100 million yen (US$843,668) -- were only intended to be the first in a continuing series; and subsequent prizes are expected to be awarded every five years.[17]  The prize has been made possible through a combination of government funding and private donations.[18]

List of laureates[edit]
The Japanese government has commemorated Dr. Noguchi's life by printing his portrait on Japanese 1000 yen banknotes since 2004;[19] and this new initiative intends to do more than honoring the man himself.  The Hideyo Noguchi Africa Prize is expected to draw attention to those whose own work mirrors what Dr. Noguchi strove to achieve.

Matthevia
This list of prehistoric chitons is an attempt to create a comprehensive listing of all genera from the fossil record that have ever been considered to be polyplacophora, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful (nomina dubia), or were not formally published (nomina nuda), as well as junior synonyms of more established names, and genera that are no longer considered chitons.

Naming conventions and terminology[edit]
Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:

Junior synonym: A name which describes the same taxon as a previously published name. If two or more genera are formally designated and the type specimens are later assigned to the same genus, the first to be published (in chronological order) is the senior synonym, and all other instances are junior synonyms. Senior synonyms are generally used, except by special decision of the ICZN, but junior synonyms cannot be used again, even if deprecated. Junior synonymy is often subjective, unless the genera described were both based on the same type specimen.
Nomen nudum (Latin for "naked name"): A name that has appeared in print but has not yet been formally published by the standards of the ICZN. Nomina nuda (the plural form) are invalid, and are therefore not italicized as a proper generic name would be. If the name is later formally published, that name is no longer a nomen nudum and will be italicized on this list. Often, the formally published name will differ from any nomina nuda that describe the same specimen.
Nomen oblitum (Latin for "forgotten name"): A name that has not been used in the scientific community for more than fifty years after its original proposal.
Preoccupied name: A name that is formally published, but which has already been used for another taxon. This second use is invalid (as are all subsequent uses) and the name must be replaced. As preoccupied names are not valid generic names, they will also go unitalicized on this list.
Nomen dubium (Latin for "dubious name"): A name describing a fossil with no unique diagnostic features. As this can be an extremely subjective and controversial designation, this term is not used on this list.

British writer and film critic

Peter Nicholas Bradshaw (born 19 June 1962) is a British writer and film critic. He has been chief film critic at The Guardian since 1999, and is a contributing editor at Esquire.


Early life and education[edit]
Bradshaw was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School in Hertfordshire[1] and studied English at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he was president of the Cambridge Footlights. He was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1984, followed by postgraduate research in the Early Modern period in which he studied with Lisa Jardine and Anne Barton. He received his PhD in 1989.[2]

Career[edit]
In the 1990s, Bradshaw was employed by the Evening Standard as a columnist, and during the 1997 general election campaign, editor Max Hastings asked him to write a series of parodic diary entries purporting to be written by the Conservative MP and historian Alan Clark, which Clark thought deceptive and which were the subject of a court case resolved in January 1998, the first in newspaper history in which the subject of a satire sued its author. Bradshaw was not put into the witness box by his QC Peter Prescott, and the judge Gavin Lightman found in Clark's favour, granting an injunction, deciding that Bradshaw's articles were then being published in a form that "a substantial number of readers" would believe they were genuinely being written by Alan Clark.[3] Bradshaw found it "the most bizarre and surreal business of my professional life. I'm very flattered that Mr Clark should go to all this trouble and expense in suing me like this."[4]
Since 1999, Bradshaw has been chief film critic for The Guardian, writing a weekly review column every Friday for the paper's Film&Music section. He is a regular guest reviewer on the Film... programme broadcast on BBC One. He was on the Un Certain Regard jury for 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
He wrote and performed a BBC Radio 4 programme entitled For One Horrible Moment, recorded on 10 October 1998 and first broadcast on 20 January 1999, which chronicled a young man's coming of age in 1970s Cambridgeshire. His bittersweet short story Reunion, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 21 October 2016, was narrated by Tom Hollander and described as "sad and sly, and connected impermeably to the mid-Seventies and what it felt like to be young".[5] Another short story, entitled Neighbours Of Zero, first broadcast on Radio 4 on 17 November 2017, was narrated by Daniel Mays.[6] Bradshaw's story Senior Moment, first broadcast on Radio 4 on 22 May 2020, was narrated by Michael Maloney.[7] Bradshaw co-wrote and acted in David Baddiel's sitcom Baddiel's Syndrome, first aired on Sky One.[8]

Eotomistoma is a dubious genus of crocodyliform from the Lower Cretaceous of China.

History[edit]
Eotomistoma was named by Chung-Chien Young in 1964 based on two pieces of the snout.[1] Young assigned it to the Tomistominae. However, other researchers, such as Eric Buffetaut, were skeptical of Young's interpretation, and in 1981 Denise Sigogneau-Russell re-studied it and determined the specimen was a chimera of a crocodylian and a choristodere.[2] Sigogneau-Russell named the choristodere fossil Ikechosaurus. The remaining snout fragment, still the holotype of Eotomistoma,  is now considered to be an indeterminate crocodyliform.[3]

Paleoecology[edit]
Eotomistoma is known from the Lower Cretaceous Luohandong Formation. It was a contemporary of the choristodere Ikechosaurus and the crocodyliforms Theriosuchus and Shantungosuchus.[3]

Reception[edit]
A critic from The New Indian Express wrote that "While the film may not achieve flawless victory, Komal Kumar’s presence makes it somewhat watchable. So prepare yourself for a visit to a spooky house, but only if you’re seeking laughter from cheesy jokes more than the real scares".[2] A critic from The Times of India wrote that "If you are bored of content-oriented films and looking for something different, which can also induce a good amount of laughter and scare, Namo Bhootatma-2 can be enjoyed in theatres".[3] A critic from Deccan Herald wrote that "The slapstick comedy sometimes evokes laughter but poor taste brings it down. The film begins with a promising premise but fails for want of a gripping narrative".[4] A critic from The South First wrote that "Kannada actor Komal Kumar is the only saving grace in this sequel to his previous hit horror-comedy — Namo Bhoothathma".[5]
A Sharadhaa, writing for New Indian Express, gave a rating of 2 out of 5 stars in her review of 'Namo Bhoothathma 2.' The film, directed by Murali, attempts to blend horror and comedy within the setting of an eerie haunted house. While the movie fulfills the requirement of an unsettling backdrop, it falls short in execution, relying on recycled and distasteful humor that may leave viewers wanting more innovative jokes. Komal Kumar's comedic timing shines, adding some charm to an otherwise lackluster film. Despite its shortcomings, the movie combines humor and supernatural intrigue, with Kumar's presence making it somewhat watchable for those seeking laughter from cheesy jokes more than genuine scares.

Backspace key
Backspace (← Backspace) is the keyboard key that in typewriters originally pushed the carriage one position backwards, and in modern computer systems typically moves the display cursor one position backwards,[note 1] deletes the character at that position, and shifts back any text after[note 2] that position by one character.


Nomenclature[edit]
An early typewriter with a backspacer[sic] key. (Blickensderfer Model 7)
Although the term "backspace" is the traditional name of the key which steps the carriage back and/or[note 3] deletes the previous character, typically to the left of the cursor, the actual key may be labeled in a variety of ways, for example delete,[1] erase,[note 4] or with a left pointing arrow.[3] A dedicated symbol for "backspace" exists as U+232B ⌫ but its use as a keyboard label is not universal. Some very early typewriters labeled this key the backspacer key.
Backspace is distinct from the delete key, which in paper media for computers[note 5] would punch out all the holes to strike out a character, and in modern computers deletes text at or following the cursor position. Also, the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object (such as an image inside a document, or a file in a file manager), while backspace usually does not.[4][5]

Combining characters[edit]
In some[note 6] typewriters, a typist would, for example, type a lowercase letter A with acute accent (á) by typing a lowercase letter A, backspace, and then the acute accent key. This technique (also known as overstrike) is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ASCII caret (^, for the circumflex accent). Backspace composition no longer works with typical modern digital displays or typesetting systems.[note 7] It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of Unicode, though such characters do not work well with many fonts, and precomposed characters continue to be used. Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks, namely positioning the accent first, and then the base letter on its position.

Use in computing[edit]
Common use[edit]
In modern systems, the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the backspace key's function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.[3] In computers, backspace can also delete a preceding newline character, something generally inapplicable to typewriters.
The backspace key is commonly used to go back a page or up one level in graphical web or file browsers.

^H[edit]
Further information: Caret notation
Pressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing  (Control+H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the backspace key was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' followed by typing a regular 'H'.
Example:

Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman; he's visiting from corporate HQ.[6]
Alternatives[edit]
An alternative sometimes seen is ^W, which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline. This shortcut has also made it into the insert mode of the Vi text editor and its clone Vim.[7]
^U deletes a line.[8]

Other meanings[edit]
In a mainframe environment, to backspace means to move a magnetic tape backwards, typically to the previous block.

Notes[edit]


^ The meaning of "backwards" depends on the direction of the text, and could get complicated in text involving several bidirectional categories.

^ "after" here implies on the same logical line of text

^ in some correcting typewriters it did both

^ for example in One Laptop Per Child[2]

^ such as punched cards or paper tape

^ Many typewriters don't advance accent characters, thus no backspace is needed where the accent is typed ahead of the letter it is to be combined with. However, even with such machines, the backspace is still used to produce certain other characters, e.g. for combining "o" with "/" to make "ø".

^ There is no reason why a digital display or typesetting system could not be designed to allow backspace composition, a.k.a. overstrike, if an engineer chose to do that. As most contemporary computer display and typesetting systems are raster graphics-based rather than character-based (as of 2012), they make overstrike actually quite easy to implement. However, the use of proportional-width rather than fixed-width (monospaced) fonts makes the practical implementation of overstrike more complicated, and the original physical motivation for the technique is not present in digital computer systems.

The Election Commission of Malaysia (Malay: Suruhanjaya Pilihan Raya Malaysia), abbreviated SPR or EC, is a commission set up for ensuring fair and equitable operations in undertaking the elections in Malaysia. The agency falls under the purview of the Prime Minister's Department.[1]


History[edit]
The Election Commission (EC) was formed on 4 September 1957, under Article 114 of the Constitution of Malaysia, which empowers it to conduct elections for the Dewan Rakyat and state legislative bodies.
At its establishment, the EC only consisted of a chairman and two members – Datuk Dr Mustafa Albakri Hassan together with Lee Ewe Boon and Ditt Singh.
A secretariat was also set up to fulfil the commission's functions and carry out its decisions, with a secretary made the chief administrator. The first EC secretary was H. Cassidy.
After the formation of Malaysia in 1963 and the inclusion of Sabah and Sarawak, another member was added to represent the two states on a rotation basis. Datuk Abang Marzuki Nor from Sarawak was the first such member appointed.
An amendment to Article 114 made in 1981 provided for the new post of a deputy chairman, and Abdul Rahman Abdul Hassan was the first to hold this position.
Today, the EC has a chairman, a deputy chairman and five members, all appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong after consulting the Conference of Rulers.

Constitutional mandate[edit]
Under Article 114, the commission is empowered to "conduct elections to the House of Representatives (Dewan Rakyat, the lower house of Parliament) and the Legislative Assemblies of the States". Under the Constitution of the independent Federation of Malaya, the Commission comprised one chairman and two members, but after Malaya merged with North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore to form Malaysia, the commission's membership was expanded by constitutional amendment to provide for an additional member from Sabah or Sarawak. A 1981 amendment to the Constitution added another member and created the post of deputy chairman.[2]
The commission has the power to delimit constituencies, revise the electoral roll of registered voters, and regulate the manner in which elections are conducted. Although the Constitution does not refer to the commission as being a body independent from influence by the government or otherwise, constitutional scholars have generally considered the Constitution as intending to protect the independence of the commission.[citation needed] Among other things, commissioners are protected by tenure, and may only be removed through the same procedure as a judge of the Supreme Court. The terms of remuneration of a commissioner cannot be altered to his disadvantage after he has been appointed.[2]
Members of the commission are appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King), who must consult with the Conference of Rulers and appoint a Commission which has the confidence of the public. Although the Constitution does not expressly require consultation with the Prime Minister in this regard, it has been argued that under Article 40 of the Constitution, the King cannot act on his own discretion unless explicitly stated; in all other cases, he must acquiesce to the advice of the Prime Minister, and as such the appointments to the commission are made with the advice of the Prime Minister. Members of the Commission retire at the age of 65.[3]

Functions[edit]
Apart from regulating elections, the EC's duties include reviewing the boundaries of parliamentary and state constituencies, holding by-elections and carrying out registration exercises.
It also collects information on newly developed areas to ensure a fair representation of voters in each constituency, promotes awareness on how important it is to vote and revises the electoral roll by deleting the names of those who are dead or have been disqualified.
On polling day, EC members and officers will be stationed at polling centre nationwide to oversee the process.

Controversies[edit]
See also: Bersih; Bersih 3.0 rally; and Malaysian general election, 2018
The EC has been accused of being half-hearted in electoral reforms and in 2012, the chairperson and the deputy chairperson was accused to be members of the ruling party. Both individuals admitted to may have been members at some point, but the deputy chairperson later retracted the admission and denounced it as an attempt to besmirch the EC.[4]
During the 14th Malaysia General Election on 9 May 2018, EC was accused of allowing gross gerrymandering and malapportionment practices by the incumbent government. It was also reprimanded as the ballot counting process was the longest in Malaysia's history, with the results still being streamed in after 4 a.m. the following day (10 May 2018, GMT +8:00). EC has also been accused of making the election day on a weekday rather a weekend. It currently denies that it tried to stop overseas Malaysians to vote.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany (Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Norddeutschland) is a Lutheran member church of the Protestant Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, EKD). 
The denomination was established on 27 May 2012 as a merger of the North Elbian Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg, and the Pomeranian Evangelical Church.[1] It covers the combined area of all those former member churches, which are the federal states of Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Nordkirche is the only Landeskirche in Germany which covers parts of both New states of Germany and West Germany. It is also called Nordkirche (North Church). 
In 2016, Nordkirche had 1,704 ordained pastors and more than 84,000 volunteers, and by the end of 2020, they had 1,892,749 members.[2][3] At the end of 2022, this had gone down to 1,772,953 members, with 1,562 pastors.[4]

Chalybeate Springs is an unincorporated community in Meriwether County, in the U.S. state of Georgia.[1]

History[edit]
The first settlement at Chalybeate Springs was made in the 1830s.[2] The community was named for a chalybeate-impregnated mineral spring near the original town site.[2] A variant name is "Chalybeate".[1] A post office called Chalybeate Springs was established in 1860, the name was changed to Chalybeate in 1895, and the post office closed in 1929.[3] The Georgia General Assembly incorporated the place in 1907 as the "Town of Chalybeate Springs".[4] The town's municipal charter was dissolved in 1995.[2]

Bombing exercises conducted by South Korean F-4s
Tactical bombing is aerial bombing aimed at targets of immediate military value, such as combatants, military installations, or military equipment. This is in contrast to strategic bombing, or attacking enemy cities and factories to cripple future military production and enemy civilians' will to support the war effort, to debilitate the enemy's long-term capacity to wage war.[1] The term "tactical bomber" only refers to a bomber aircraft designed specifically for the primary role of tactical bombing, even though many other types of aircraft ranging from strategic bombers to fighters, interceptors, and helicopters have been used in tactical bombing operations.
Tactical bombing is employed for two primary assignments.  Aircraft providing close air support attack targets in nearby proximity to friendly ground forces, acting in direct support of the ground operations (as a "flying artillery"). Air interdiction, by contrast, attacks tactical targets that are distant from or otherwise not in contact with friendly units.

History[edit]
Tactical bombing was the first type of aerial bombing mission. It began in the Italo-Turkish War when pilots dropped small bombs over the side of their open cockpits onto enemy troops below. One of the earliest examples of tactical bombing was at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915 when the Royal Flying Corps dropped bombs on German rail communications. By the time of World War II a number of specialized aircraft were developed to fulfill this role, including various fighter-bombers.  During the Korean War tactical bombing missions were sometimes carried out by older piston-powered fighters such as the Vought F4U Corsair. In the Vietnam War, missions were frequently directed by Forward air controllers (FACs) flying small propeller-driven planes. The FAC would mark targets with smoke, often in coordination with infantry on the ground.  Bombers orbiting overhead would then fly in to hit the target.  
In the modern era, precision-guided munitions ("smart bombs") can be directed with extreme accuracy. Dedicated tactical bomber aircraft types have largely been supplanted by fighter-bombers and strike aircraft.

ITV Tyne Tees, previously known as Tyne Tees, Channel 3 North East and Tyne Tees Television, is the ITV television franchisee for North East England and parts of North Yorkshire.[1]
Tyne Tees launched on 15 January 1959 from studios at a converted warehouse in City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, remaining in the city until July 2005 when Tyne Tees moved to smaller studios in Gateshead. Tyne Tees has contributed various programming to the ITV network and Channel 4, as well as its regional output. Some of Tyne Tees' best known programming includes the groundbreaking music show The Tube, critically acclaimed adaptations of Catherine Cookson novels, and children's programmes such as Supergran.
The ownership and management structure of Tyne Tees has altered across its history, particularly in various mergers with Yorkshire Television. The two stations were managed by Trident Television during the 1970s, and the two stations merged again in 1992 to form Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. A series of takeovers and mergers across the ITV network, instigated by the large groups Granada and Carlton, led to Tyne Tees becoming part of ITV plc in 2004.  The licence is currently held by ITV Broadcasting Ltd and the original Tyne Tees Television Ltd was dissolved on 28 March 2017.[2]
The analogue signals in the Tyne Tees region were switched off in 2012, making the station, along with ITV London and UTV, one of the last ITV regions to become digital-only.[3]


History[edit]
Further information: Timeline of Tyne Tees Television
Launch and the 1960s[edit]
The station's first logo. The three Ts morphed from an anchor, reflecting the nautical influence of the station's name.[4]Independent television was introduced to Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television to the rest of the country and advertised for bids.[5] Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a television transmitter.[6] Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and News Chronicle executives George and Alfred Black.[7] This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children's programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957.[8] Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was programme director, and both brothers were prominent board members.[8] The company opened its first Newcastle office at Bradburn House on Northumberland Street, and it was from there, on 3 January 1958, the company directors issued 300,000 ordinary shares at fours shillings each.[5]
Tyne Tees is named after two of the region's three primary rivers. ITA considered the original name, "North East England", was imprecise. Some of the consortium's suggestions were rejected: "Three Rivers Television" for being obscure, and "Tyne, Wear, and Tees" for being too long. Eventually, in October 1958, the name "Tyne Tees" was announced.[9] The other major river, the Wear (which runs between the Tyne and the Tees), was represented within Tyne Tees' early signature tune "Three Rivers Fantasy".
The BBC transmitted their programmes from the Pontop Pike transmitting station in County Durham. The ITA built a new transmitter nearby at Burnhope, to cover an area from Alnwick to Northallerton, and west to Middleton-in-Teesdale. Television sets required a new aerial, the Yagi array, to receive the high frequency that the transmitter was using.[10]
Tyne Tees went on air at 5 p.m. on 15 January 1959, three years after the first British independent television station, and the tenth such station to launch. The then-prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the nearby Stockton-on-Tees for two decades, was interviewed live on the opening night.[11] This was followed by a live variety show, named The Big Show, broadcast from a small studio.[12] However, this local content was followed by an episode of the American police series Highway Patrol and an evening of entertainment programmes including I Love Lucy and Double Your Money.[11]
The full first night's programming was

21:00 Wagon Train
22:00 ITN News
22:15 Murder Bag
22:45 I Love Lucy
23:15 Epilogue read by the Bishop of Durham[13]
In the 2006 documentary A History of Tyneside, veteran North East newsreader Mike Neville suggested that the launch of Tyne Tees enabled local people to be able to hear local accents and dialects on television, since early broadcasters, particularly those from the BBC, tended to speak in Received Pronunciation.[12] Scholar Natasha Vall suggests that the station's commitment to broadcasting comedy helped establish a regional identity. George and Alfred Black had toured working men's clubs looking for material for television.[11] Local comic Bobby Thompson was invited to host a solo show. However, poor ratings and an unenthusiastic cast led to the show's cancellation after barely a year.[14]
Where most independent television companies published their schedules in the magazine TV Times, Tyne Tees produced their own listings magazine.  The Viewer was published  by News Chronicle, a company with connections to the station through the Black brothers. It was produced to satisfy " 'Tyne Tees' policy to be most regional of all the independent stations".[15] Initially produced from an office in Forth Lane, near Newcastle station, it moved to the City Road studios when Dickens Press took over publication in 1963. The magazine became the biggest selling magazine in the region, with a circulation of 300,000 per week. New contracts issued by the ITA in 1968 stipulated that all ITV companies publish their listings in the TV Times, which became a national magazine with regional variations for the listings.[15]  After 498 editions,[16] the last issues of The Viewer was published in September 1968.[15]
The first advertisement screened on Tyne Tees was for Welch's Toffee. The proprietor's niece is Denise, who would become a well-known actress and personality.[17] In 1959, Tyne Tees charged advertisers £100 for 15 seconds during prime time.[17] The station launched a marketing campaign in the 1960s to sell advertising time named 'Through Plan'. One of the range of promotional material was a poster called 'Sweet Sixteen', featuring photographs of 15 men accompanied by their full names, job titles and other formal history. The sole woman was simply referred to by her first name and her measurements. Historian Geoff Phillips comments that this "was a profound statement of the culture of the time".[17] Tyne Tees produced Advertising Magazines (AdMags), which were programmes with a loose storyline designed to advertise several products within an edition. The 15-minute programmes each endorsed about 12 products. Clients sat in the control room during rehearsals to ensure that their products were getting the exposure for which they had paid.[18]
A committee was established in 1960 under the leadership of British industrialist Sir Harry Pilkington to consider the future of broadcasting. The 1962 Pilkington Report criticised ITV, and Tyne Tees in particular. Some companies, historian Simon Cherry notes, were scrambling "very readily for the lowest common denominator ... Tyne Tees was notorious for avoiding minority programmes and putting out cop shows or westerns instead."[19]

1970s[edit]

Following his report, Pilkington prompted the government to impose a levy on ITV's revenue, the effects of which were heightened by a recession in 1970 when revenue had declined by 12 percent in real terms. Despite a reduction of the levy, Tyne Tees was one of the contractors facing collapse. To ensure Tyne Tees' survival, the ITA allowed it to affiliate with Yorkshire Television under a joint management company named 'Trident Television'.[20] The third 'prong' of Trident was intended to be Anglia Television, but the IBA ruled out their involvement.[21] Trident Television was formed in March 1969 as a joint venture to sell advertisements for Tyne Tees and Yorkshire. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees then came under Trident's ownership on 1 January 1974. Peter Stanley Paine, Director of the broadcaster's holding company Trident, was appointed managing director of Tyne Tees Television in 1974.
For the first time, one company owned two distinct and separate ITV franchises although the new company was dominated by the larger, stronger Yorkshire whose shareholders owned 71.5 percent of the new company.[22] Trident had sales offices in London, where most agencies are located and where most advertising is bought and sold.[23]
A major factor in the merger was that when UHF transmission was introduced in 1969 to accommodate colour television it was found that the key Bilsdale transmitting station in North Yorkshire so dominated the territories of both companies that its allotment to either individual company would have seriously prejudiced the coverage and sales revenue of the other. The ITA agreed that Tyne Tees and Yorkshire could be considered as one company for the purposes of selling airtime, while expressing their individual identities in their programming output.[24]
A political scandal caused problems during one of Tyne Tees' franchise renewals. Producer Tony Sandford recalls that Lord Pilkington was sent by the ITA to question the station's executives.[25]  One-time leader of Newcastle City Council T. Dan Smith had been convicted for accepting bribes concerning the redevelopment of Newcastle city centre. Pointing out that Smith became a director of the station, Pilkington asked why Tyne Tees failed to produce a documentary about a Newcastle politician, instead leaving it to Manchester-based Granada's current affairs programme World in Action.[25] By the late seventies,  Tyne-Tees's locally made programming amounted to an average of less than nine hours a week, with the remainder of programming from the ITV network. In 1978, The Economist reported that a group called  Northumbria Television, partially financed by local firms Bellway Holding and Swan Hunter, applied to the IBA to take over the franchise from the "tired" Tyne Tees for the two and a half years until the scheduled franchise renewal in 1981.[26]

1980s[edit]

Yorkshire and Tyne Tees applied separately for renewal of the franchises in 1980, and each won.[27]  However, the two companies were required to demerge from January 1982 as a condition of the renewal of their ITV franchises.[24][28]  The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the successor to the ITA, recognised the criticism, reported The Economist, "that Trident was London-dominated, overly diversified, and out of touch with the grass roots. It instructed Trident to set up both companies as independents and to retain only a minority shareholding in each."[27] The IBA imposed the condition that for the 1980 franchise round a company could only own one franchise, although it could earn up to 30 percent of another.[22]  By November 1981, Trident had sold all but residual stakes in the two companies (15% and 20% respectively).[29] When the new licences started in January 1982, Trident sold all but 30 percent of Yorkshire, and 25 percent of Tyne Tees.[22]
During the 1980s, Tyne Tees began to develop separate services for the Northern and Southern halves of the region. From a small two-camera studio at Corporation House in the centre of Middlesbrough, Tyne Tees developed nightly opt-out news bulletins for Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire as part of the flagship magazine programme Northern Life. The company also pioneered non-news programming for the two sub-regions, including the nightly Epilogues, which ended a 29-year run in September 1988 when Tyne Tees commenced 24-hour broadcasting, although Tyne Tees had run an on-screen Jobfinder teletext service throughout the night since November 1987.
Meanwhile, developments in satellite and cable television, in addition to the two BBC channels and the new Channel 4, began to put pressure on ITV's finances. ITV lost 3 percent of advertising between 1993 and 1994.

1990s[edit]
1993 Franchise Round and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees merger[edit]
In 1990, Yorkshire bought Vaux Breweries' 19 percent stake in Tyne Tees, costing £5.1 million.[30][31] In the same year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher initiated a blind auction system, through the Broadcasting Act 1990, through which companies had to bid for the regional franchises. This system was to be used in the 1991 franchise round, which caused large changes to the network. Granada Television, the franchise holder for North West England, had long thought that the North of England should consolidate to "counter the potential dominance of the south east".[31] Tyne Tees outbid their main competition by £10 million; their main challenger was 'North East Television', which was backed by Granada, Border and local newspaper the Evening Chronicle.[30] Along with HTV and Yorkshire, Tyne Tees believed that they had to bid high to win. These companies bid so high that the Independent Television Commission seriously considered rejecting the business plans of each in turn and disqualifying them. However, they eventually decided in their favour.[32][33] Together, the now-merged companies were committed to paying about £60 million a year to the government for the right to broadcast, a substantial amount compared to the £2,000 bid by Central, ITV's largest station.[33]
New regulations from the ITC allowed Yorkshire to merge with Tyne Tees, this time under the name Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc (YTT), although their ITV franchises remained separate.[34] The merger allowed the companies to avoid collapse following their high franchise bids.[35] This was the first step to ITV becoming one company in England and Wales.[30] The merger led to the culling of staff.[36]  YTT's two largest shareholders became Pearson and LWT.[33] From 1 January 1993, Yorkshire and Tyne Tees broadcast all regional programmes simultaneously, affecting programming that had been shown at different paces in different regions (such as Blockbusters and the Australian soap operas The Young Doctors and Prisoner: Cell Block H). Most of the regional programming was produced by Yorkshire and broadcast across the two stations, an area that the ITC considered too broad to be of local interest.[37]

Broadcasting standards[edit]
The annual cost of the franchise began to take its toll on the company. At the end of 1993, the company revealed that it was heading for a pre-tax loss in the 1992–93 fiscal year instead of the expected profit. Chairman and chief executive Clive Leach was sacked as a consequence. According to Variety, YTT "oversold its airtime to advertisers and failed to meet its ratings targets, resulting in a huge revenue shortfall estimated by analysts at over $20 million."[33] The industry newspaper also reported that the company "attempted to bolster its flagging 1992–93 revenues by giving advertisers deep discounts for advance airtime bookings made for the following year."[33] Local MP Peter Mandelson wrote to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor, in June 1992, saying "Yorkshire and Tyne Tees are motivated by the interests of their shareholders, not their viewers, and need to make urgent savings  ... it is quite clear that this is not so much a merger but a gobbling up of a smaller franchise held by a larger company."[38]
Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were repeatedly warned over worsening standards at the Newcastle-based station and at one point the Independent Television Commission (the then-governing body of ITV) threatened to revoke the Tyne Tees licence if the situation did not improve. In 1993 the MP Ann Clwyd described Tyne Tees as having been "stripped of any meaningful identity since its take over by Yorkshire TV" and Ian Ritchie, Managing Director at Tyne Tees, left the company over a widely publicised disagreement with the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees board over what he saw as an unacceptable drive to centralise the company, including the complete closure of all non-news operations at Newcastle and a proposal to close the City Road studios.[39] In October 1993, Yorkshire TV's founder Ward Thomas was brought in to stabilise the situation at the company and quickly returned the company to profitability.[40]

Bruce Gyngell appointed chair[edit]
The Channel 3 North East branding, introduced in 1996, was derided by viewers. Granada removed the branding in 1998.[36]
Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am,  became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995.[41] On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region",[42] in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3.[43] The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV,[44] and "3" was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network  was decommissioned within three years.[45] Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and we want it to be known that we are part of this great region and moving with it."[42] Tyne Tees acquired the brand "Channel 3 North East", with 'Tyne Tees Television' still being retained as the company name.[42]

Acquisition by Granada[edit]
On 26 June 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by the Granada Media Group plc (now ITV plc).[46][47] The takeover concentrated ownership of the ITV network into three large groups: Granada, Carlton and United News & Media.[48]
The new guidelines, published by the ITC in 1998, about the Channel 3 licence renewals signalled substantial cuts in the companies' payments to the Treasury.[49] Licences awarded in 1991 were due to expire in January 2001. However, companies, including Tyne Tees, which had bid high in 1991 were allowed to apply early to try to win financial relief. The new 10-year contract began in January 1999.[49] In 1999, the cost of the tender fee that Tyne Tees was paying fell to £46 million, from the £70.5 million that it paid in 1998.[50]

2000s[edit]
This logo, used from November 1999 until October 2002, was generic to the ITV network, with each region's familiar logo appearing in a smaller form. The "ITV1" logo was added to the logos and idents in August 2001.[51]
The design of the 2006 to 2013 logo was generic to the ITV network.
ITV centralisation[edit]
Days after the two largest companies in the network, Granada and Carlton, announced that they would merge, the regional names were withdrawn from networked programming in an "attempt to make ITV1 more marketable nationally with a single generic brand."[45] (Scottish, which does not trail any of the network shows under any ITV1 branding, Grampian, Ulster and Channel, each kept their own names but used their own versions of the new look.[45]) Tyne Tees Television was rebranded as ITV1 Tyne Tees on 28 October 2002.[45] The name "Tyne Tees" only appeared before regional programmes; the rest of the time, only the "ITV1" name was shown. The Tyne Tees logo continued to appear after its own programmes.[45] Graeme Thompson was appointed MD and Controller of Programmes at ITV Tyne Tees in 2004, having been appointed Director of Broadcasting in December 1997 and then Controller of Programmes in 2001. He became Dean for Arts, Design and Media at the University of Sunderland in June 2009.[52]
In 2004, Granada plc and Carlton Communications merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales. Tyne Tees became part of ITV plc, the largest television production company in the world, which now owned 90 percent of ITV.[53]
On 9 February 2005, Ofcom issued a proposed timetable for ending analogue terrestrial television transmissions as part of the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its analogue signal in 2008.[54]
In September 2007, Executive Chairman of ITV plc Michael Grade announced that as part of ITV's five-year business strategy, Tyne Tees' newsroom would merge with Border Television.[55] Politicians have expressed concern, however, that the merger would affect the quality of news for southern Scotland, in particular, would fail if it lost its customised bulletins.[56] The changes would mean that aside from the merged Border-Tyne Tees regional news and political programmes, the station could broadcast only 25 minutes of dedicated North East news every weekday. In October 2008, the National Union of Journalists threatened industrial action if ITV tried to force any of the changes without discussion.[57] Between December 2008 and February 2009, around 50 staff at the station were made redundant or accepted voluntary redundancy, including presenters, journalists and production staff. The new merged ITV Tyne Tees & Border service launched on 25 February 2009.[3]

Bullying at Tyne Tees[edit]
In March 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported that there was bullying at Tyne Tees that lasted for six years. One manager was accused of using inappropriate language about people with disabilities, women reporters, Chinese people and Romani people.  The manager was disciplined after one inquiry, but then more journalists complained about the same manager. The manager defended himself by claiming he was using black humour. He finally left the company with a pay-off of about £50,000. The original whistleblower left the company in 2006 and was paid £80,000 after threatening to take his case to an employment tribunal.[58] Following this incident, ITV adopted an anti-bullying programme. An ITV spokesman advised that the total cost of the five bullying investigations was £1 million.[58]

2010s[edit]
On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce fully separate regional news services for the ITV Tyne Tees and ITV Border regions were approved by OFCOM. On 16 September 2013 both ITV News Tyne Tees and Lookaround were restored as two single 30-minute regional programmes on weekdays with separate shorter daytime and weekend bulletins reintroduced.[59]

Studios[edit]
Two converted warehouses provided the base for Tyne Tees on City Road until 2005.
Main article: Television Centre, Newcastle upon Tyne
Tyne Tees's original studios were located on City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and were converted from two furniture warehouses purchased by the company. These new studios formed the basis of Tyne Tees operations and featured the company offices. The location was deliberately chosen because of its proximity to the telephone exchange in Carliol Square. Television signals were relayed by land-line from the studios to the switching centre; a distance between the studios and the exchange greater than 1 mile (1.6 km) would have significantly increased the cost of receiving the networked programmes from the other ITV stations.[60]
The complex initially contained four studios, with a fifth built in 1981 to accommodate productions for Channel 4.[61] Two nearby pubs, The Egypt Cottage and Rose & Crown, became affectionately known as Studio 5 because of the amount of time that the station's staff spent in them. Scottish and Newcastle Breweries offered to sell the adjacent The Egypt Cottage to the station when it was established, but Tyne Tees declined. However, the upstairs room was used as rehearsal space, and the pub would regularly feature in the '80s music show The Tube.[62]

Tyne Tees has been based on the Gateshead bank of the River Tyne, just south of the mouth of the River Derwent, since July 2005.The complex continued until 2004 following the merger of Granada and Carlton to form ITV plc. As a result of the merger, ITV plc had (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to save money, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs.[63] A documentary about the move to new premises, The Big Move, reflected that over the years the staff numbers had dropped by about 800, and around 170 people would be moving to the new site.[64]
Tyne Tees moved to Television House at The Watermark, a new business park adjacent to the MetroCentre in Gateshead, in 2005. The first broadcast from their new base took place on 2 July 2005.[65] Along with the move, news reporters had to learn a range of new skills, such as editing their own reports. The new practices contrasted with early reporting, which had an average crew of five. The new equipment required only a camera operator, who could also operate sound equipment, and a reporter.[64] Television House also acts as a base for ITV SignPost, Britain's biggest supplier of British Sign Language (BSL) services for television, video, CD-ROM, DVD, film and the Internet.[66]
In 2010, the studios at City Road along with the neighbouring pub, the Egypt Cottage, were demolished with plans for a residential development on the site.
Tyne Tees also has smaller studios and offices in Billingham, York, London and within the Media Centre at the University of Sunderland.[65]

Sub-regions[edit]
Tyne Tees operated two sub-regional news programmes from around 1983 until 2009, having been a commitment in the 1980 contract round. An opt-out was used from the main Northern Life bulletin was launched to provide localised news from each area.[67][68] These two sub-opts were:

Tyne Tees North – Broadcasting from the Pontop Pike and Chatton transmitters to viewers in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Bulletin presented by normal team from Newcastle Studio.[67][68]
Tyne Tees South – Broadcasting from the Bilsdale transmitter to viewers in County Durham, North Yorkshire and the Teesdale. During the 1980s and early '90s, this was a recorded segment (complete bulletins during weekday afternoons) presentation of which alternated between Newcastle and Middlesbrough studios (Tyne Tees was unable at the time to broadcast different content live to both transmitters simultaneously and so had to pre-record the southern opt even when presented from Middlesbrough). From 1993 to 1995 a completely separate broadcast "Network North" was produced from new studios in Billingham (this was intended by YTTTV to be broadcast on some YTV transmitters, and was advertised in the press as such, but in reality it went out on Tyne Tees only. Both local news programmes were renamed Tyne Tees News in 1996). From September 1996 a live 15-minute broadcast from Billingham was inserted into "North East Tonight", which continued until 2005 when separate live programmes were produced from the Gateshead studios, before these ended in 2009. For nearly a decade during the 1990s and 2000s, the Billingham studios were used for the pan-regional late weekday bulletin, and for a time in the early 2000s Billingham was also used for a sub-regional version of "North East Today", a daytime magazine programme.[67][68]
As part of a cost saving initiative within ITV plc, Michael Grade announced in 2007 that the regional news service would be reduced from seventeen distinct news programmes and services to nine, affecting all the sub-regional services. As a result, all Tyne Tees sub-opts were ceased immediately. As part of the same plans, he also announced that Tyne Tees would be merged with Border Television, subject to Ofcom approval which occurred the following year, resulting in one large programme covering both regions. The two services were demerged in September 2013 and ITV News Tyne Tees and ITV Border once more began making their own 30 minute news programmes, although unlike other ITV regions which had offered sub-regional services, the Tyne Tees opt-out services were not reinstated at this time.[69][70]

Station identification[edit]
The station identification, or idents for short, of Tyne Tees varied over time; however, most were based the letters TTTV arranged in a box format. The launch ident featured a white anchor which then gradually turned into three letter T's alongside each other.[71] This ident was accompanied by a shortened version of the station's signature tune "Three Rivers Fantasy", a specially commissioned work by composer and arranger Arthur Wilkinson. The musical overture merged several regional folk tunes, such as "Water of Tyne", ending in The "Blaydon Races".[14] Part of the medley  was based upon "The Sailor's Hornpipe".[4]
The arrival of colour to ITV in 1969 led the companies to re-evaluate their on-screen identities. Tyne Tees replaced the triple-T logo in 1970 with the basic layout of two letter Ts above 'TV', an icon which would be incorporated into many future redesigns. Commentator Andrew Bowden observes that this interlinked design remains strongly associated with the company.[72] The ident also introduced the blue and yellow colour scheme that would remain in use for many years. The dark blue was popular amongst ITV contractors because it closely approximated to black on a black and white television set. The version of the logo included the word 'COLOUR', boasting the new technology.[72][71]
In 1979, the ident was modified once more to remove the word 'colour' and to give it a more dynamic form up. The result was the yellow logo flying down onto a black background before the outline extended out towards the screen, set to a synthesised tune. The name 'Tyne Tees' then flew in below and the background colour faded to blue.[71]
The ident was again redesigned in 1988, in which the colour scheme was reversed and lighter shades of blue and yellow used. The form up was also altered to water flowing along sand, before the water divided into the Tyne Tees logo. The logo used computer animation for the first time.[71][73]
However this bold new look was not to last, as Tyne Tees adopted the 1989 ITV generic look. The look consisted of the top left corner of the logo being inserted into the 'V' segment of the ITV logo, with the station name placed underneath the Tyne Tees ITV logo. However, not every ITV station embraced the new logo, and Tyne Tees abandoned it in 1991.[71][74]
The generic ident were replaced with ones produced by Tyne Tees, featuring a large reflective block which the viewpoint rotated around, before panning up to reveal it is the Tyne Tees logo. The music from the previous generic look was retained. Three variations were used, one with a black background, one with a multi coloured background and one with a grey background, with each version taking over from its predecessor after only a few months of use.[45][71][75]
In 1992, Tyne Tees dropped their famous logo which they had previously been using since 1970 and opted instead for four separate letters stacked atop each other like previously accomplished spelling TTTV. The form up was over a grey background with a line moving across the screen, forming the letters as they went.[71]
When Tyne Tees adopted the Channel 3 North East branding in September 1996, the traditional "TTTV" logo arrangement was dropped in favour of a large '3', with the region written to the left of the '3'.[71] The name "Tyne Tees Television" was only seen in small letters at the bottom of the screen, whereas Yorkshire, who also adopted the Channel 3 brand a month later, was allowed to keep its 'chevron' logo alongside the '3'.[76] On-screen announcements said, "This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting on Channel 3 in the North-East."[42] The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with "Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)" by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences.[42] Following Granada's takeover in June 1997, the Channel 3 branding was scrapped in March 1998.[42] As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: "People never really grasped the name – it didn't exactly trip off the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it has been there for years."[42] All other regions in the network had retained their own identities rather than conforming to the generic 'Channel 3' brand.[45]
The "TTTV" logo returned to television screens in a new form, "three-dimensional gold metallic lettering on a blue background", on 9 March 1998.[42][71] This logo was more stylised than the 1992 equivalent and kept the music used throughout the '3' era. However, dual branding with the "ITV" name was introduced a year later, as part of the 1999 generic look.[51][71] In this, the Tyne Tees logo was reduced to minuscule lettering in a blue box at the top of the screen, with emphasis being placed on the station name and ITV logo. However, this ident was supplemented by an ident to introduce local programming. This ident introduced on 4 September 2000 featured a new logo: a TTTV variant that was simplified to strictly vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines only. An arc of circles also adorned the top right corner. The ident itself featured pictures from the region. However, despite the new logo, the new logo wasn't applied to the generic idents.[71]
From 28 October 2002, all network programmes were introduced with a generic ITV1 ident. Regional programming used a generic ident with the name Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until November 2006, after which no regional idents existed.[71] The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production end boards until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption.[77]

Programming[edit]
The station's founding executives George and Alfred Black used their theatrical background to produce a lot of light entertainment programming on Tyne Tees in the early years. One of the best known was The One O'Clock Show, a 40-minute variety show broadcast on weekdays.[78] After 1,098 editions and more than five years on air, the final show was broadcast in March 1964.[79] Some editions of The One O'Clock Show were produced by David Croft, who would go on to co-write many BBC situation comedies. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the Ned's Shed and Mary Goes to Market admags, as well as producing his first sitcom, Under New Management, set in a derelict pub in the North of England.[80]
The bulk of Tyne Tees' output has been its regional programming, consisting of news, current affairs and local interest. Its longest running news programme was Northern Life, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is ITV News Tyne Tees.[46] Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating EastEnders being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following News at Ten on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, Around the House, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions.
Tyne Tees was obliged to contribute programming for the ITV network, although the bulk of network programming was purchased from the largest stations.[81] Tyne Tees contributed game shows to the network, including Crosswits (1985–98) and Chain Letters (1987–97). Tyne Tees became a prolific producer of children's entertainment for the ITV network in the 1970s and 1980s. From the late 1970s, it produced series such as The Paper Lads, Quest of Eagles, Barriers and Andy Robson. This continued into the 1980s with Madabout, How Dare You!, Gilbert's Fridge and weekday pop-music show Razzamatazz, a pop programme that attracted many major recording artists to appear in a 17:15 slot.[82] Tyne Tees also managed the production of Get Fresh, a  Saturday morning show hosted in various weeks by different ITV regions.[83][84] Super Gran, based on a series of books about a grandmother with superhuman powers, was also successful in the mid-1980s.[85] Additionally they also dubbed the South African children's series Oscar the Rabbit in Rubbidge which featured narration by Lance Percival.
With independent production company Festival Films and Television, Tyne Tees produced several adaptations of books by local novelist Catherine Cookson. The second dramatisation, The Black Velvet Gown, was the number one drama of 1991, winning an Emmy Award for best TV drama.[86] Long-running soap opera Coronation Street was briefly produced at Tyne Tees' City Road studios in 1963 while all of the studios at the show's home, Granada Television in Manchester, were occupied by a production of the opera Orpheus in the Underworld.[87] However, not all of the station's output has been successful. The 1997 soap opera Quayside was axed after 17 episodes after competing with the BBC's EastEnders.[88][89]
Tyne Tees has also produced a wide range of music programming. One of the first attempts at reaching the teenage audience was Young at Heart, hosted by Jimmy Savile and Valerie Masters in 1960.[90] In 1979, Tyne Tees launched two national series, Alright Now and Check it Out, the latter a mix of rock music and segments on youth-oriented social issues; among performances by established acts, the two shows offered early exposure to bands linked to the North East, notably Dire Straits and The Police.[91][92]

The public entrance to Studio 5 at City Road gave The Tube its title.
The most famous music show from the station, though, derived its name from the studios themselves. Produced for Channel 4, and first broadcast three days after the new station's launch in November 1982, The Tube acquired its name from the architecture of the public entrance to Studio 5, from where the show was broadcast, at the City Road complex. Under the direction of Gavin Taylor, The Tube filmed rock band Queen's 1986 Wembley concert for later broadcast and video and DVD release.[93] Cameras bearing the Tyne Tees logo can be seen throughout the concert.[94] The Tube was dropped in 1987 as a result of falling audience figures and an incident involving Jools Holland, who cursed during a live trailer.[95][96] A couple of months later, Tyne Tees launched another music show, this time for the ITV network. Whereas The Tube featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, Tyne Tees' The Roxy, concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart. The show suffered, however, from not having a regular slot on the ITV network. Also, unlike The Tube, which had gained a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Newcastle for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the BBC's more established Top of the Pops in the more accessible London.[97]

Klondex Mines was a North American gold-mining company, based in Reno, Nevada and Vancouver, British Columbia.  It had three operating mines in Nevada and one in Manitoba,[1] and was listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange[2] and the NYSE American.[3]  In March 2018, it was acquired by Hecla Mining.[4]

History[edit]
Klondex Mines was founded in 1975, through the spinoff of the Fire Creek Project in Nevada from Placer Development.[5]  Until 2012, Klondex was principally engaged in exploration of its Fire Creek Project.[5]  It attempted to sell this project to several suitors in the 2000s, but was not successful in doing so.[5]
In 2011, a dissident shareholder group successfully proposed a new board of directors.[6]  In September 2012, the current CEO, Paul Huet, took control, as the result of another proxy battle.[7]  Huet had experience with the company, as part of previous teams examining the possibility of buying its Fire Creek project.  At that time, the company was in dire financial straits.[7]
In February 2014, the company bought the Midas mine and mill in Nevada from Newmont Mining for US$83 million.[8]  Huet had experience with the mine, having previously been the mine manager for seven years.   In January 2016, the company purchased the Rice Lake gold mine (also called the True North mine) in Manitoba for US$32 million, from creditors.[9]  Also in 2016, it purchased the Hollister mine in Nevada for US$80 million.[10]
In 2018, the company laid off 90 employees at its True North mine, as the result of disappointing production in 2017.[11]  Production was only about 25,000 ounces, as opposed to the expected 50,000 ounces.[11]
In March 2018, the company was acquired for US$462 million by Hecla Mining.  At the same time, Klondex's Canadian assets (principally the True North mine) were spun out into a new entity, Klondex Canada, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange.

Operations[edit]
Klondex had four operating mines, with total 2017 production of about 220,000 gold-equivalent ounces.[12]  Its four mines were[1]

Fire Creek mine in Lander County, Nevada
Midas mine in Elko County, Nevada
Hollister mine in Elko County, Nevada
True North mine (also called Rice Lake mine) in Bissett, Manitoba

Agno (Italian pronunciation: [ˈaɲɲo]) is a historic town and a municipality in the district of Lugano in the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Due to its position on Lake Lugano it is popular with tourists, and hosts summer festivals, with two hotels and several camping grounds. It is served by the Lugano-Agno airport.
The official language of Agno is Italian.


History[edit]
Agno is first mentioned in 818 as Anium.  It was known by its German name Eng, though this is no longer used.[4]

Pieve of Agno[edit]
Etruscan tomb located in the churchyard of S. Giovanni Battistat
The emergence of the Pieve or Parish of Agno is related to the spread of Christianity in late-Roman era along the Milan-Como-Riva San Vitale axis.  The dedication of the church to Saint John the Baptist (San Giovanni Battista) refers to its character as a baptistery.  Documents from the years 735 and 818 (deed of gift by King Louis the Pious) testify to the existence of a religious center at Agno.  Originally, it was probably an Ambrosian Rite church, but in 1002-04 it came into the possession of the Bishop of Como.  A collegiate chapel is first mentioned in 1192.  The first known pastor is Gulielmus de Merchurolo in 1288.  The extent of the parish (from Bironico to Marchirolo) is mentioned in the manuscript of Sessa from 1352.[5]
The visitation records of Bishop Giovanni Antonio Volpe of Como (1571) give a detailed report on the properties of the parishes belonging to the Pieve and the sub-parishes.  On Swiss soil it included: Agno, Aranno, Arosio, Astano, Bedigliora, Bironico, Bioggio, Bosco Luganese, Breno, Cademario, Camignolo, Caslano, Castelrotto, Curio, Ison, Magliaso, Medeglia, Mezzovico, Miglieglia, Mugena Muzzano, Neggio, Novaggio, Ponte Tresa, Pura Rivera, Robasacco, S. Abbondio (Gentilino and Montagnola), S. Maria (Iseo and Cimo), Sessa, Sigirino, S. Pietro di Gravesano, Torricella Vernate, Vezio and Vira.  The Pieve also included a number of villages, which are now in Italy.  These included: Arbizzo, Ardena, Cadegliano, Cremenaga, Cugliate, Fabiasco, Lavena, Marchirolo, Marzio, Viconago.[5]
Initially it was under the authority of Como, and later the Duchy of Milan.  At the beginning of the 15th Century it was part of the communitas Vallis Lugani and appointed representatives to the Council of the Bailiwick. Following the Act of Mediation of 1803, the parish lost its political meaning entirely.[5]

Community of Agno[edit]
Vedeggio river at Agno. The river bed correction in 1906 opened new farm land in Agno
Because of its strategic location at the northern end of an arm of Lake Lugano and along the Varese-Ponte Tresa-Monte Ceneri road, Agno was possibly the center of a Roman Pagus.  Some of the archeological finds from Roman Agno are in the local Museo plebano.  As a central town, Agno became a commercial center with numerous market privileges.  One of these markets, the Fair of S. Provino (second Monday in March) has survived to this day.[6]
These holdings of the Bishop of Milan in Agno during the Middle Ages included fishing rights.  These rights later went to the Bishop of Como and then to local private ownership.  The fishing rights were finally removed by Swiss authorities in 1843.
The Collegiate Church of San Giovanni Battista stands on the foundations of a previous Roman building.  Within the church are the relics of the patron saint, San Provino, who was the second Bishop of Como.  The oldest village lay at the foot of the church, and later, the settlement extended to the hills and along the streets.[6]
The correction of the Vedeggio river course was done in 1906, which opened up additional agricultural land in Agno.  After World War II the town grew rapidly from trade and industry.  The emergence of tourism as an economic factor is reflected in population growth from 1960.  In 1980, the Lugano-Agno airport opened allowing scheduled flights into nearby Lugano.  Its importance is continually growing both in terms of tourism in Ticino and the development of a financial center in Lugano.  In 1990, there were 16,270 flights and 300,000 passengers into the airport.  In 1996, the Federal Council granted additional concession, which allowed the expansion of infrastructure to accommodate 700,000 passengers annually.[6]

The Salt River (Spanish: Río Salado, O'odham [Pima]: Onk Akimel, Yavapai: Hakanyacha or Hakathi:, Maricopa language: Va Shly'ay[5]) is a river in Gila and Maricopa counties in Arizona, United States, that is the largest tributary of the Gila River.[2] The river is about 200 miles (320 km) long.[6] Its drainage basin covers about 13,700 square miles (35,000 km2).[3] The longest of the Salt River's many tributaries is the 195-mile (314 km) Verde River. The Salt's headwaters tributaries, the Black River and East Fork, increase the river's total length to about 300 miles (480 km). The name Salt River comes from the river's course over large salt deposits shortly after the merging of the White and Black Rivers.[7][8]

Course[edit]
The Salt River as seen in Salt River Canyon, 2004
The Salt River is formed by the confluence of the White River and the Black River in the White Mountains of eastern Gila County. The White and Black rivers, and other tributaries of the upper Salt River, drain the region between the Mogollon Rim in the north and the Natanes Mountains and Natanes Plateau to the east and south. Tributaries of the Salt River also drain the Sierra Ancha and Mazatzal Mountains. The White and Black rivers drain the White Mountains in the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Together the two rivers drain an area of about 1,900 square miles (4,900 km2).[2] The Salt River, along with the Black River, forms the boundary between the Fort Apache Indian Reservation to the north and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation to the south.
The Salt River is fed by numerous perennial streams that start as springs and seeps along the Mogollon Rim and in the White Mountains. The Salt River is perennial from its tributary headwaters to Granite Reef Diversion Dam near Mesa.[2]
From the Black and White confluence, the Salt River flows generally west and southwest. It is joined by Carrizo Creek, a 25-mile (40 km) perennial stream, and then flows through the Salt River Canyon. Cibecue Creek, a 36-mile (58 km) perennial stream, joins the river in the canyon, flowing from the north through the Fort Apache Reservation. Between Carrizo and Cibecue creeks, the Salt River becomes the boundary between the Tonto National Forest on the south and the Fort Apache Reservation on the north. Another perennial stream joins from the north, 46-mile (74 km) long Canyon Creek, followed by Cherry Creek. Just downstream from the Salt's confluence with Medicine Creek, a portion of the Tonto National Forest is designated the Salt River Canyon Wilderness. The Salt River forms the northern and western boundary of the wilderness for several miles, after which the national forest and wilderness occupy both sides of the river.

Salt River alongside State Route 77, September 2006
Rio Salado south of Stewart Mountain Dam
Continuing its westward course, the Salt River is joined by Pinal Creek from the south, just before leaving the Salt River Canyon Wilderness. The river continues to flow through the Tonto National Forest until leaving the mountains near Mesa. Below the Pinal Creek confluence, the Salt River enters Theodore Roosevelt Lake, the first of four reservoirs on the river. Tonto Creek joins the Salt River in Theodore Roosevelt Lake. Below Theodore Roosevelt Dam, the Salt River passes through the canyon between the Mazatzal Mountains and the Superstition Mountains and is impounded by Horse Mesa Dam (forming Apache Lake) then Mormon Flat Dam (forming Canyon Lake) then Stewart Mountain Dam (forming Saguaro Lake). These four reservoirs are part of the Salt River Project. The water is used by the Phoenix metropolitan area for municipal, industrial, and agricultural purposes. The storage capacity of the reservoirs is 2,910,200 acre-feet (3.5897×109 m3) for Roosevelt, 245,100 acre-feet (302,300,000 m3) for Apache, 57,900 acre-feet (71,400,000 m3) for Canyon, and 69,800 acre-feet (86,100,000 m3) for Saguaro.[2]

Salt River passing below the Central Avenue Bridge in southern Phoenix after winter rains, March 2010
As the Salt River passes through its reservoirs, it flows by the Four Peaks Wilderness, near the Four Peaks. A few miles downstream of Stewart Mountain Dam, the last of the four Salt River Project dams, the Verde River joins the Salt from the north. Fountain Hills is located a few miles to the northwest. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is located near the Verde–Salt confluence. The Tonto National Forest ends a couple miles below the Verde River confluence, and the Salt River enters the eastern edge of the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. Less than 1⁄2 mile (0.80 km) from the national forest boundary, the Granite Reef Diversion Dam diverts all remaining water in the Salt River into the Arizona Canal and Southern Canal, which deliver drinking and irrigation water to much of the Phoenix metropolitan area. The dam and canals are part of the Salt River Project.
Below the diversion dam, the bed of the Salt River is dry, except following rain or upstream runoff. The USGS stream gage at 51st Avenue, Phoenix, records no flow at all on many days—in 2009, for example, there was no flow for most of the year, except during parts of February and March when the river's discharge reached an average of 87 cubic feet per second (2.5 m3/s).[9] The diversion capacity at Granite Reef Diversion Dam is 3,600 cubic feet per second (100 m3/s), with 2,000 cubic feet per second (57 m3/s) for the Arizona Canal, and 1,600 cubic feet per second (45 m3/s) for the Southern Canal.[10]
Below Granite Reef Dam, the Salt River leaves the mountains and flows past the cities of Mesa, Tempe, and Scottsdale, then south of downtown Phoenix, where it passes north of South Mountain Park. With the exception of Tempe Town Lake, the riverbed winding through the cities is usually dry, except when heavy rains upstream force Stewart Mountain Dam to release more water than can be diverted at Granite Reef Dam. The Salt River joins the Gila on the southwestern edge of Phoenix, approximately 15 miles (24 km) from the center of the city. Monument Hill overlooks the confluence of the two rivers and is the site of the Initial Survey point for Arizona, the Gila and Salt River Meridian.

River modifications[edit]
The Salt River formerly flowed through its entire course year-round. However, the free-flowing river would frequently flood, including a massive flood in 1891. This flood, as well as others, led to the construction of several dams, beginning with the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, have caused the river to become intermittent in many parts.[11]
Despite the dry river bed, or arroyo, dangerous flash floods occasionally occur, especially during monsoon storms in late July and early August. Flood waters can wash out roads. Bridges have been damaged, notably in 1980, 1993, and 2005. The natural flow of the Salt is 2,570 cubic feet per second (73 m3/s) at its mouth.[citation needed] However, except after rainfall, the Salt is dry or a small stream below Granite Reef Dam. The river was formerly navigable throughout its course by small craft. The river is still navigable in the majority of the area where it still carries water. [citation needed]
The river was used for irrigation by the pre-Columbian Hohokam culture, by later Native Americans, and by early Euro-American settlers in the 19th century. It currently provides a major source of irrigation and drinking water for Phoenix and surrounding communities through the Salt River Project. The river's water is distributed over more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) of irrigation canals, used primarily for the growing of cotton, alfalfa, fruit, and vegetables.

Ecology[edit]
Wild horses grazing on the banks of the Rio Salado
North American beavers (Castor canadensis) historically flourished on the river. In an historical account, George C. Yount, a fur trapper with the Pattie expedition, wrote on 1 February 1863, "...we began to ascend the Black River [Salt River]... We found it to abound with beavers... We followed up this stream to where it forks in the mountains; that is to say, about 80 miles from its mouth."[12]
2022 fish kill in three lakes has been caused by golden algae.[13]

Water quality[edit]
There are turbidity problems along many stream reaches in Salt River's watershed; these are related to rangeland management, recreation, mining, sand and gravel operations, and other sources.[2] High levels of fecal coliform bacteria and ammonia have been reported for Carrizo Creek and the White River.[2]

History[edit]
"Map of Colonel Sanford's Expedition to Sombrero Butte" in September 1869 showing Río Saludo (NAID 103396422)
In ancient times, the river was home to the Salado culture and the Hohokam culture. The Akimel O'odham, also known as the Pima people, lived along the Salt River and dug canals, using irrigation to provide water to their villages and farms in the arid environment. The river was known to the authorities of New Spain as the Río Salado. The United States government recognized the territory of the Pima people by way of executive order signed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. A subsequent executive order also signed by President Hayes reduced the size of the Salt River portion of the reserve from approximately 680,000 acres to 46,627 acres. Today the Salt River Pima–Maricopa Indian Community live alongside the bank of the Salt River maintaining their traditions and way of life from before European colonization.[14]

The oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, also known as the oyster toad, ugly toad, oyster cracker, oyster catcher, and bar dog, is a Northwest Atlantic species of fish of the family Batrachoididae. The maximum length of this toadfish is 43.2 cm (17 in), but they infrequently surpass 38 cm (15 in). The world record size for this species is 19.2 inches which is 48.76 cm. They are generally yellowish with a pattern of brown oblique bars.  The species can live in poor conditions and needs little food to live. They can be found near the shore from Maine to Florida.
In 1998, NASA sent the oyster toadfish into space to investigate the effects of microgravity on the development of otolithic organs. The study found little difference between terrestrial development and those in space.


Life history[edit]
Spawning and life cycle[edit]
Oyster toadfish spawn in coastal estuaries from May through August, with some variation between latitudes.[3]  Males excavate nests under rocks or other debris and begin making advertisement calls, also known as boatwhistles and foghorns.  Females are attracted to these calls.  Females choose a mate, enter the nest, attach eggs to the underside of the structure, then leave.  Females provide no parental care.  Males fertilize the eggs, then defend and clean the nest while embryos develop.  Toadfish embryos are large and, as a result, have been studied for over a century.[4]
After about 4 weeks the eggs hatch.  At first, the young toadfish stay attached to the yolk.  When the yolk has been absorbed for energy, the young toadfish learn to swim. Even when the young have started to swim, the adult still protects its young.
Juveniles reach sexual maturity at 2-7 years and have a lifespan of 8 years.[5]  Little is known about individual range or whether toadfish exhibit natal philopatry.

Predators and prey[edit]
Toadfish are ambush predators during the day, when they remain buried or hidden under structure and lunge for passing prey.  At night they forage.  Toadfish eat benthic invertebrates (e.g. polychaetes) and xanthid crabs.[6]  Toadfish have sharp teeth and powerful jaws.
Oyster toadfish are apex predators on oyster reefs.  Nonetheless, evidence exists that they are prey for birds (e.g. cormorants[7]).  A related species, Opsanus beta, is prey for dolphins.[8]  Research has demonstrated that toadfish will call less when dolphin sounds are played from a nearby speaker.[9]  For protection, toadfish have a venomous spine in the first ray of the dorsal fin.  They can bury themselves up to their eyeballs in sand, and might be capable of camouflage.

Physiology[edit]
Oyster toadfish
Like many bony fish oyster toadfish have a swim bladder that is used to maintain buoyancy.  Like some vocalizing fish, the swim bladder is also used to make sounds.  Oyster toadfish males use their swimbladders to make advertisement calls.  The fast-twitch swimbladder muscles of toadfish can contract as much as 300 times per second,[10] more quickly than fast-twitch muscles in most vertebrates.

Model for hearing and behavior[edit]
Toadfish are easy to observe and collect because they spawn in shallow water.  Also, male advertisement calls are easy to detect and are critical for the animal's reproductive success.  For these reasons, toadfish have been widely studied in research that examines mating behavior, hearing sensitivity[11] and the impacts of anthropogenic noise.

Cuisine[edit]
Oyster toadfish are hard to fillet due to their bony bodies. The meat of the oyster toadfish is flaky and is described as having a sweet flavor, similar to that of blowfish.[12][13]

Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (MMAL) is a fully owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation of Japan. The company was established in 1980 and began vehicle manufacturing in that year, having taken over the facilities of Chrysler Australia. Australian production ceased in 2008 and since that time the company has been exclusively a vehicle importer. 


History[edit]
Chrysler[edit]
Construction of the vehicle assembly plant at Tonsley Park was commenced by the then owners, Chrysler Australia, in 1963, and the assembly plant was opened in October 1964. 

Mitsubishi Motors Australia – established 1 October 1980[edit]
The Colt subcompact car was produced from 1982 until 1990
The Magna mid-size car was produced from 1985 until 2005
After the acquisition by parent company Chrysler of a 15 percent interest in Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in 1971, Chrysler Australia began building Mitsubishi-designed Chrysler-branded vehicles, namely the Chrysler Valiant Galant (later Chrysler Galant), based on the 1972–1977 Mitsubishi Galant and the Chrysler Sigma, a variant of the 1977–1985 Mitsubishi Galant. In 1979, Mitsubishi Motors Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation each acquired a one sixth equity in Chrysler Australia. The collective price paid for the two-sixths equity was A$27 million.[1]

On 30 April 1980, the two Japanese companies assumed 98.9 percent control by paying a further $52 million to acquire Chrysler's remaining 65 percent share.[2][3] The remaining 1.1 percent was held by 690 local investors.[3] The company name was changed to Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited on 1 October 1980.[4] Production of the popular Sigma range of vehicles continued under the Mitsubishi name until 1987 with its eventual replacement, the Magna, having been released in 1985. Colt production, which had commenced in 1982,[5] ended in 1990, with no locally manufactured replacement.
The Magna, like its forebear the Sigma, was based on the Japanese Galant. Input from MMAL resulted in a wider car than the Japanese donor model to suit the Australian market and to compete with the popular Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore. A station wagon variant was added to the model lineup in 1987. The Magna received several model refreshes during the 1990s including a luxury variant named Verada. However, by the early 2000s, it was clear that the Magna / Verada line, now in its third iteration had aged considerably. A facelift to the Magna / Verada line in 2003 failed to lift sales.[6] After lobbying from Mitusubishi Motors Australia Limited (MMAL) approval for construction of a new vehicle was granted by Mitsubishi Motors Corporation. Funding was provided to reengineer the Tonsley Park plant with the result that a new vehicle, the Mitsubishi 380, was delivered to the market in late 2005.
In 2003 MMAL gained approval from MMC to create Mitsubishi Research and Development Australia (MRDAus) with a budget of $30 million. MRDAus was to be the fourth global Mitsubishi Research and Development Centre. MMAL's proving ground at Tailem Bend was to be upgraded including the addition of a high speed oval and numerous other proving ground facilities and the Testing and Proving group's laboratories at MMAL headquarters in Tonsley Park was also to be upgraded. MRDAus was originally tasked with completing Mitsubishi 380 Testing and Proving prior to the start of volume production. MRDAus also negotiated substantial job share for the testing and proving of the PS41L, the codename for a stretched 380 for the US market. Unfortunately with the financial woes facing MMC globally and the cancelling of the PS41L program MRDAus was unable to reach its full potential. In late 2004 after expanding to 90 personnel the MRDAus expansion was halted before the 380 was even launched. A security fence around most of the expanded Tailem Bend site was almost completed and the earthworks for the high speed oval had begun when work was halted in 2004.

Sales challenges[edit]
Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's financial and legal issues weighed hard on MMAL, with public perception of the viability of the company reaching an all-time low in 2004. Company research conducted in mid-2004 revealed that roughly four out of every five believed that Mitsubishi would cease production in Australia.[7]
The withdrawal of DaimlerChrysler from its involvement with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in 2004, along with the revitalisation plan that called for the closure of the Lonsdale engine plant, did not help the public's perception of MMAL as a viable company.
MMAL ended 2004 with a stockpile of approximately 4,000 unsold Magnas and Veradas.[8] To restore consumer confidence in the brand and to clear the model backlog, a series of television advertisements began airing in December 2004.[7] Centred on Mitsubishi Australia's then Chief executive officer, Tom Phillips, the advertisements promoted the introduction of an industry-first five-year/130,000 kilometre warranty. Mitsubishi reworked a slogan from former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, concluding their commercials with the tagline, "If you can find a better-built, better-backed car anywhere, then buy it".[9] The campaign successfully boosted sales and allowed the backlog to be cleared.
The Mitsubishi 380, the successor vehicle to the Magna, raised hopes for the future of MMAL when launched. Hopes stemmed from the sales success that the Magna experienced when it was launched and the fact that the Australian automobile market was growing at the time. However, the 380 sold poorly from its introduction and failed to meet expected sales targets. This resulted in a reduction in daily production volume from 180 to 50 vehicles per day, along with further reductions in the workforce.

The "make or break" Mitsubishi 380 began production in 2005, lasting less than three years on the market.
Sales of other Mitsubishi Motors Corporation vehicles began to show improvement in Asian and European markets as new vehicles were introduced during 2006. These vehicles were also introduced into the Australian market, boosting MMAL's Australian sales into the segments that these vehicles occupied, though this did nothing to help their sales of locally manufactured product.

Cessation of local production and corporate restructure[edit]
On 5 February 2008, it was announced that MMAL would cease production of the 380 at the Tonsley Park plant, effective at the end of March 2008. The two-page statement released announced they would pursue a "full import strategy" for the Australian market due to unviable 380 sales.[10] The last Mitsubishi 380 sedan left the production line on 27 March 2008. Coinciding with the last vehicles to leave the line was the redundancy of about 500 workers, with another 430 staying for another 12 months. Those remaining decommissioned the plant and produced a stockpile of spare parts destined to last ten years.[11]
By late 2009, MMAL had removed the last piece of manufacturing equipment from the Tonsley Park assembly plant. Ownership of the plant was handed over to the Government of South Australia on 16 December 2009.[12]

The disused Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide
At the same time, MMAL began a restructure of the remaining divisions of the company. This restructure concluded in mid-2009 and saw staff numbers reduced to around 200 through redundancy and outsourcing.
The majority of the remaining staff are involved with sales and marketing activities, though MMAL retains some product engineering capability to perform any design changes that may be required to fit Mitsubishi Motors Corporation's global products into the Australian market.

Redevelopment of plant sites[edit]
The 61-hectare Tonsley site is being redeveloped for retail, TAFE facilities, hi-tech manufacturing, with future residential plans.[13][14]
The Lonsdale engine manufacturing plant was transformed into the Onkaparinga Recycling plant in 2010.

Vehicle lineup[edit]
Since the end of local 380 production, the entire vehicle range that MMAL sells is imported from Japan with the ASX, Eclipse Cross, and Outlander, while also imported from Thailand with the Pajero Sport and Triton.

This article is about the concept in Christianity generally. For the concept in Mormonism, see Spirit body.
In Christianity, the apostle Paul introduced the concept of the spiritual body (Koine Greek: sōma pneumatikos) in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 15:44), describing the resurrected body as "spiritual" (pneumatikos) in contrast to the natural (psychikos) body:

So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.— 1 Corinthians 15:42-44, NIV
Christian teaching traditionally interprets Paul as comparing a resurrected body with a mortal body, saying that it will be a different kind of body; a "spiritual body", meaning an immortal body, or incorruptible body (15:53—54).[1] In the Catholic Church, traditionally the resurrected body is called the "glorified body", and possessed four characteristics: incorruptibility, subtlety, impassibility, and agility. The bodies of the damned are also raised incorrupt, but not glorified or free from suffering.

Music video"Kids in the Street" on YouTube

"Kids in the Street" is a song by American rock band The All-American Rejects, released as the second single from their fourth studio album of the same name on March 13, 2012.[1]


Background[edit]
"Kids in the Street" was written by Nick Wheeler and Tyson Ritter. In a "track-by-track" video showing the band talking about each song from their fourth studio album, Ritter says, "This song is the theme of the record. It's this callback to a moment in your life where you were so dumb, but so smart at the same time. The candle of naivety was burning down like that, but the candle of cynicism was yet to be lit."[2]

Reception[edit]
The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Bloody Disgusting reviewed the track as "Immediately catchy" and that it "Makes great use of synth riffs and nostalgic imagery",[3] while Pop Crush said "The Rejects offer a nostalgic look back to a more innocent time on "Kids in the Street" - the ambitious, nearly five-minute-long song presents a frenetic pop beat paired with loopy synths created during a day of experimentation in the studio."[4] Rock NYC posted a review saying "The All-American Rejects are back with their poppy good fun.  Although sporting a weird accent the song is contagious and twittery."[5]
Homeless Tracks said "The song is similar in tone to "Beekeeper's Daughter", in that it is darker than previously released music by the group. "Kids in the Street" features complicated drum rhythms inspired by a Garage-band loop, dominant synths, and electric guitars. The vocals feel somewhat subdued, but the instrumentation is more than ambitious enough to account for that. The disparity between vocals and instruments can create a level of frustration for the listener, however, although this tension actually adds a lot to the song",[6] While Artistdirect quoted  "The band hits a timeless chord on the standout title track. Over a hulking beat from drummer Chris Gaylor, Ritter paints a whimsical picture of childhood memories back when you could be a real kid in the street. All of the elements converge for a cinematic love letter to better days."[7]

Music video[edit]
A music video for "Kids in the Street", directed by Jon Danovic, was shot in February 2012 and released April 16 onto Vevo.[8] It revolves around younger versions of each band member attending a house party as the video shows their nostalgic time and expediences while present (possibly based on true events) as well as The All-American Rejects themselves in real-time age performing the song with glow-in-the-dark instruments in a small, dimly-lit room.

Reception[edit]
The Round Table stated "The video captures the theme of the album, which the band describes as 'lyrically and musically nostalgic', and stars younger versions of the band members themselves and features a classic no-holds-barred performance from the multi-platinum group in a surrealistic, neon, windswept vision of their past."[9]

Depletion gilding is a method for producing a layer of nearly pure gold on an object made of gold alloy by removing the other metals from its surface.[1] It is sometimes referred to as a "surface enrichment" process.[2]


Process[edit]
Most gilding methods are additive: they deposit gold that was not there before onto the surface of an object. By contrast, depletion gilding is a subtractive process whereby material is removed to increase the purity of gold that is already present on an object's surface.
In depletion gilding, other metals are etched away from the surface of an object composed of a gold alloy by the use of acids or salts, often in combination with heat. Since no gold is added, only an object made of an alloy that already contains gold can be depletion gilded.
Depletion gilding relies on the fact that gold is highly resistant to oxidation or corrosion by most common chemicals, whereas many other metals are not. Depletion gilding is most often used to treat alloys of gold with copper or silver. Unlike gold, both copper and silver readily react with a variety of chemicals. For example, nitric acid is effective as an etching agent for both copper and silver. Under the proper circumstances, even ordinary table salt will react with either metal.
The object to be gilded is coated, immersed, or packed in a suitable acid or salt, and usually heated to speed the process. These chemicals then attack the metallic copper and silver in the object's surface, transforming it to various copper and silver compounds. The resulting copper and silver compounds can be removed from the object's surface by a number of processes. Washing, chemical leaching, heating, or even physical absorption by porous materials such as brick dust have all been used historically. Meanwhile, the relatively inert gold is left unaffected. The result is a thin layer of nearly pure gold on the surface of the original object.
There is no well-defined minimum gold content required to successfully depletion gild an object. However, the less gold that is present, the more other material must be etched away to produce the desired surface appearance.  In addition, the removal of the other metals usually leaves the surface covered with microscopic voids and pits. This can make the surface soft and "spongy" with a dull or matte appearance. This effect becomes more pronounced as more base metal is removed. For this reason, most depletion gilded objects are burnished to make their surfaces more durable and give them a more attractive polished finish.
Like other gilding processes, depletion gilding provides a way to produce the appearance of pure gold without its disadvantages: its cost and rarity, and its softness and denseness. By producing a layer of gold over a layer of copper or other metal, objects can be made that are lighter, sturdier, and cheaper while still appearing to be nearly pure gold.

Variations[edit]
The term depletion gilding usually refers to the production of a layer of gold. However, it can also be used to produce a layer that is an alloy of gold and silver, sometimes referred to as electrum. Certain chemicals, such as oxalic acid, attack copper but do not affect either silver or gold. Using such a chemical, it is possible to remove only the copper in an alloy, leaving both silver and the gold behind. Thus, if the original object is composed of copper, silver, and gold, it can be given a gold surface by removing both silver and copper, or an electrum surface by removing only the copper.
Likewise, with an appropriate chemical, a layer of nearly pure silver can be produced on an object made of copper and silver. For instance, sterling silver can be depleted—'depletion silvering'—to produce a fine silver surface, perhaps as preamble to application of gold, as in the Keum-boo technique.
However, in the majority of cases depletion gilding is in fact used to produce a gold finish, rather than one of electrum or silver.

Applications[edit]
Depletion gilding is a decorative process, with no significant industrial applications. It is not widely used in modern times, having been superseded by processes more suited to mass production, such as electroplating. Some individual artisans and small shops continue to practice it.
However, depletion gilding was widely used in antiquity.[3] While it requires skill to execute it well, the process itself is technologically simple, and uses materials that are readily available to most ancient civilizations. Some form of depletion gilding has been used by nearly every culture that developed metalworking. The South American Sican culture in particular developed depletion gilding to a high art.[4] Some ancient alloys, such as tumbaga, may have been developed specifically for use in depletion gilding. The technique was not known to be used by Anglo-Saxons until detailed examination with electron microscopes of treasures such as the Staffordshire Hoard revealed its use in the twenty-first century.[5][6][7]
Certain cultures are thought to have attached mythical or spiritual significance to the process. Gold was considered sacred in many early civilizations and was highly valued in nearly all of them, and anything relating to it had the potential to take on cultural importance. Moreover, the ability to turn what appeared to be an object made of copper into what seemed to be pure gold would be very impressive. There is some speculation that depletion gilding may have contributed to the concepts of alchemy, a major goal of which was to physically transform one metal into another.

The Tollund Man (died 405–384 BC) is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 5th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age.[1] He was found in 1950, preserved as a bog body, near Silkeborg on the Jutland peninsula in Denmark.[2] The man's physical features were so well preserved that he was mistaken for a recent murder victim.[3] Twelve years before his discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, was found in the same bog.[4]
The cause of death has been determined to be by hanging. Scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice, rather than an executed criminal, because of the arranged position of his body, and his eyes and mouth being closed.[5]


Discovery[edit]
The remains of the Tollund Man shortly after his discovery in 1950.
On 8 May 1950, peat cutters Viggo and Emil Hojgaard discovered a corpse in the peat layer of the Bjældskovdal peat bog, 12 km (7.5 mi) west of Silkeborg, Denmark,[3] which was so well preserved that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim.
The Tollund Man lay 60 m (200 ft) away from firm ground, buried under 2.3 m (7 ft 7 in) of peat, his body arranged in a fetal position.[6] He wore a pointed skin cap of sheepskin and wool, fastened under his chin by a hide thong, and a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, a noose made of plaited animal hide was drawn tight around his neck and trailed down his back.[2] Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1 mm (0.039 in) in length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he was usually clean-shaven, but had not shaved on the day of his death.[7] The Tollund Man was approximately 40 years old. The Tollund Man's last meal consisted of a porridge with barley, flax, wild weed seeds, and some fish.[8]

Scientific examination and conclusions[edit]

Radiocarbon dating of Tollund Man indicated that he died circa 405–380 BCE.[9] The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the Nordic countries. The acid in the peat, needed for the preservation of a human body, is caused by a bryophyte named Sphagnum. Sphagnum fights against degradation due to resistant phenolic compounds contained in their cell walls.[10] Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.
Scientists conducted an isotope analysis of the element strontium to measure the exact quantities to get an accurate idea of where he may have traveled before his death. They took samples from his femur and hair to compare. They were only able to measure up to a year because of his hairs being short. The results contained only small differences in strontium isotope proportions, suggesting that he spent his final year in Denmark, and that he may have moved at least 30 kilometres (20 mi) in his last six months.[11]
Examinations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The Silkeborg Museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at 1.61 m (5 ft 3 in), a relatively short stature even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.
On the initial autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation.[12] The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings.[13] Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.[14]
The stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents.[15] Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, flax, false flax (Camelina sativa), and knotgrass.[15] From the stage of digestion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time.[15] Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring, when these items were not available.[15]
Both feet and the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also preserved in formalin for later examination. In 1976, the Danish police made a fingerprint analysis, making Tollund Man's thumbprint one of the oldest prints on record.[16]

Display[edit]
The Tollund Man on display at Silkeborg Museum
The body is displayed at the Silkeborg Museum in Denmark, although only the head is original. Because conservation techniques for organic material were insufficiently advanced in the early 1950s for the entire body to be preserved, the forensic examiners suggested the head be severed and the rest of the body remain unpreserved. Subsequently, the body was desiccated and the tissue disappeared. In 1987, the Silkeborg Museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base. As displayed today, the original head is attached to a replica of the body.[17]

Other bodies[edit]
Further information: List of bog bodies § Denmark
In Denmark, more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the Iron Age have been recovered.[18] Specimens from Jutland include the relatively well-preserved Borremose bodies, Huldremose Woman, Grauballe Man on display at Moesgaard Museum near Aarhus, and the similarly conserved Haraldskær Woman. Approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and/or displayed in Danish museums for continued research.[18]

In popular culture[edit]
Nobel Prize–winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney wrote a series of poems inspired by P. V. Glob's study of the mummified Iron Age bodies found in Jutland's peat bogs, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings.[19] Heaney's poem "The Tollund Man", published in his Wintering Out collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of "the Troubles".[19] Heaney wrote an excerpt from the poem in the Tollund Man exhibit's guest book in 1973.[20]
British author Margaret Drabble, in her 1989 novel A Natural Curiosity, uses her characters' obsession with the Tollund Man to provide a satirical criticism of Margaret Thatcher's modern England.[21][22]
Tollund Man is featured in several songs: "Tollund Man" (1995) by the American folk band The Mountain Goats and "Curse of the Tollund Man" (2004) by the English rock band The Darkness.
Tollund Man was mentioned in the episode "Mummy in the Maze" of the American television series Bones[23] and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie Sacrifice in which a bog body was found in the Shetland Islands.
He is also the subject of the modern novel Meet Me at the Museum, by Anne Youngson. One of the primary characters is a fictional curator at the Silkeborg Museum, who writes letters to an English woman, musing on the life and death of the Tollund Man.

Todd Herman is an American radio show host, digital political strategist, and public speaker. He hosted The Todd Herman Show on KTTH in Seattle and was a regular rotating host on The Rush Limbaugh Show. He was co-chief digital strategist for the Republican National Committee 2009 to 2011, and founded several media companies before being a conservative talk radio host.


Career[edit]
Business[edit]
Herman was president and chief evangelizing officer of theDial (formerly TheDial.com), a start-up Internet radio company. The company was based in Salt Lake City before moving to Seattle in 1999, when it had 22 staff members.[2] The company was ultimately acquired by Loudeye.[3] Herman then joined Microsoft's MSN,[1] and was involved in the creation of its MSN Video business unit.[4] He held the position of Streaming Media Evangelist at MSNBC.com and then General Manager, Media Strategy and Monetization for MSN.[5] He left Microsoft in September 2007.[5] Herman was founder and chief creative officer for SpinSpotter, a software add-on designed to detect "personal voice, passive voice, biased source, disregarded context, selective disclosure, lack of balance and over-reliance on news releases" in journalism.[1] The company had 14 employees in 2008.[1]
In March 2009, after leaving Microsoft, Herman was hired as Director of New Media for the Republican National Committee (RNC),[5][3] taking up the job the following month.[5] In that role, he oversaw the national Republican Party's digital strategy.[6] In 2010, Herman posted a personal tweet suggesting that President Barack Obama was a Muslim; the RNC distanced itself from Herman's tweet.[7]
Herman co-founded Crowdverb, a social media monitoring startup, in 2011; it was acquired in 2012 by Washington, D.C.-based Direct Impact, a unit of Burson-Marsteller.[6]

Radio[edit]
In September 2015, Herman became afternoon host at the Seattle conservative talk radio station KTTH (AM 770) in Seattle when Ben Shapiro left the slot open.[8][4] At KTTH Herman worked alongside other conservative talk show hosts David Boze and Michael Medved.[8]
In January 2019 Herman became co-host (along with Candy Harper and Mike Lewis) of The Candy, Mike and Todd Show on KIRO; the program replaced the Ron and Don Show, which had aired for 13 years.[9] The show ran in the 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. time slot for one year, ending in January 2020.[10][11] Herman returned to KTTH to host during morning drive time in March 2020, replacing "morning personality" Saul Spady.[12][13]
Herman has expressed support for the "FairTax," a proposal to abolish income and payroll taxes and replace them with a flat sales tax.[14]
Herman filled in regularly as a guest host on the nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh Show.[8][15] In January 2021, while a guest host on Limbaugh's show, Herman suggested that the perpetrators of the U.S. Capitol attack might have been "Antifa" or "BLM". The disinformation circulated widely among Trump supporters. Subsequently, in late February 2021, Herman acknowledged that "it was clear a large group of Trump supporters entered the Capitol and assaulted people" but continued to make the claim that antifa activists had planned to impersonate Trump supporters.[16]
Herman announced his retirement from his KTTH show in November 2021, with the intent to launch a podcast afterward. The podcast will have a more religious focus than his radio show.[17] The radio show ended on December 1, 2021.[18]
In October 2022 Radio America signed a new distribution and sales agreement with Herman's daily podcast and a new weekly Todd Herman Radio Show to launch November 5, 2022.[19] He guest-hosted for The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show in 2022.[20]
In January 2023 Herman was added to the line-up of the Seattle talk radio station KVI (570 AM) with a show running Sundays 5-7 p.m. plus daily commentary segments for other KVI shows.[21]

Personal[edit]
Herman considers himself a "college dropout"[15][failed verification] and a "lifetime Washingtonian".[4]

Donaldsonville (historically French: Lafourche-des-Chitimachas)[2] is a city in, and the parish seat of Ascension Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana.[3] Located along the River Road of the west bank of the Mississippi River, it is a part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area. At the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 6,695.[4]
Donaldsonville's historic district has what has been described as the finest collection of buildings from the antebellum era to 1933, of any of the Louisiana river towns above New Orleans.[5] Union forces attacked the city, occupying it and several of the river parishes beginning in 1862. Fort Butler was built on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The fort was successfully defended on June 28, 1863, against a Confederate attack. This battle was one of the first occasions when free blacks and fugitive slaves fought as soldiers on behalf of the Union. The fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
After the war, in 1868 Donaldsonville residents elected as mayor Pierre Caliste Landry, an attorney and Methodist minister; he was the first African American to be elected as mayor in the United States.[6]


History[edit]
Ascension of Our Lord Catholic Church in 1772.
The French were the first Europeans to colonize the area. They named the site Lafourche-des-Chitimachas, after the regional indigenous people and the local bayou, which they gave the same name.[7] They developed agriculture in the parish, mainly as sugar cane plantations worked by African slave labor.
Acadians, expelled by the British from Acadia in 1755, began to settle in the area from 1756 to 1785, where they developed small subsistence farms. Spanish Isleños also settled here. In 1772 when the territory was under Spanish rule, the militia constructed La Iglesia de la Ascensión de Nuestro Señor Jesucristo de Lafourche de los Chetimaches (the Ascension of Our Lord Catholic Church of Lafourche of the Chitimaches) to serve the area. The region returned later to French control for a time.[8][9]
This area was included in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and became part of the United States.[8] Americans began to move into the area. Landowner and planter William Donaldson in 1806 commissioned the architect and planner, Barthelemy Lafon, to plan a new town at this site. It was renamed Donaldsonville after him.[10]

The Louisiana State Capitol in Donaldsonville (1830)
Donaldsonville was designated as the Louisiana capital (1829–1831),[11] as the result of conflict between the increasing number of Anglo-Americans, who deemed New Orleans "too noisy" and wanted to move the capital closer to their centers of population farther north in the state, and French Creoles, who wanted to keep the capital in a historically-French area.
As a result of the wealth planters gained from sugar and cotton commodity crops, they built fine mansions and other buildings in town during the antebellum years.

Civil War[edit]
In the summer of 1862, Donaldsonville was bombarded by Union forces during the American Civil War as part of the Union's effort to gain control of the Mississippi River. The Union sent gunboats to the town and warned that if shots were fired, the Union Navy would strike the area for six miles to the south and nine miles to the north and destroy every building on every plantation. Admiral David G. Farragut destroyed much of the former capital city and put Ascension Parish under martial law, extending that to other River parishes.
Historian John D. Winters, in his The Civil War in Louisiana (1963), describes the scene:

The irate naval commander, Admiral Farragut, ordered the bombardment of Donaldsonville as soon as it could be evacuated. All of the citizens of Donaldsonville . . . "left their homes and went to the bayou . . . a detachment of Yankees went to shore with fire torches in hand." The hotels, warehouses, dwellings, and some of the most valuable buildings of the town were destroyed, Plantations . . . were bombarded and set afire. . . . A citizens' committee met and decided to ask Governor Moore to keep the [Confederate] Rangers from firing on Federal boats. These attacks did no real good and brought only crude reprisals against the innocent and helped to keep the Negroes stirred up.[12]
A citizen complained that the Rangers were useless and lawless, unable or unwilling to protect Confederate property. The citizen added that the Confederate people "could not fare worse were we surrounded by a band of Lincoln's mercenary hirelings. Our homes are entered and pillaged of everything that they [Rangers] see fit to appropriate to themselves."[13]
Union forces established a base at Donaldsonville for their occupation of river parishes. They took over some plantations, running them as U.S. government plantations to supply the forces and produce cotton.[14]

Fort Butler[edit]
Many escaping slaves entered the Union lines to gain freedom. General Benjamin Butler had declared them "contrabands" of war and would not return them to slaveholders. They stayed and worked with Union forces, helping build the star-shaped Fort Butler in the town. A work of earth and wood, it was 381 feet long on the side by the Mississippi River, the other was protected by Bayou Lafourche, and the land sides by a deep moat.[14] A stockade surrounded the fort, which contained a high and thick earth parapet. There was further security from a strong log. The fort was built to accommodate 600 men, but in 1863 there were a small garrison of 180 Union men, commanded by Major Joseph Bullen of the 28th Maine; the forces were also made up of the 1st Louisiana Volunteers, a few Louisiana Native Guard convalescents, and some fugitive slaves.[14]
In June 1863, Confederate forces attacked Fort Butler at night. Led by General Tom Green, more than 1,000 Texas Rangers attacked the fort. Free blacks and fugitive slaves joined in the successful defense of the fort, in one of the first times they fought as soldiers on behalf of the Union. The New York Tribune wrote; "When action took place the negroes were stimulated to daring deeds."[14] Historian Don Frazier, wrote; "Not only did black hands build this citadel of freedom, they defended it to the death."[14] The Union kept control of the fort and ultimately won the war. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Post-Civil War[edit]
After the war, Donaldsonville became the third-largest black community in the state, as more freedmen moved there to join those who had settled near Union forces for safety during the war. In 1868 the city elected the first African-American mayor in the United States, Pierre Caliste Landry,[6] a former slave who been educated in schools on a plantation owned by the Bringier family. After the war, he had advanced to become an attorney and state politician, serving in both houses of the legislature. He also became a Methodist Episcopal minister.[15]
Donaldsonville is the home of one of the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States.[16] The wooden structure was built in 1872 by Congregation Bikur Cholim, which disbanded in the 1940s. It is now used as an Ace Hardware store.[17] The Jewish Cemetery dates to 1800s and is located on the corner of St. Patrick Street and Marchand Drive.
Mechanization of agriculture and other changes resulted in a major loss of population in Ascension Parish from 1900 to 1930, particularly from 1920 to 1930. This was the period of the Great Migration, when tens of thousands of African Americans left the rural South to go for opportunities in northern and midwestern cities. Such changes also drew off business from the parish seat. Ascension Parish lost more than 16% of its population in that decade. In the Great Depression, the area struggled economically.[citation needed]

Historian Sidney A. Marchand, who was also an attorney, was elected as mayor of the city and state legislator during that period. He served as a state Senator and contemporary of Governor Huey Long. During the mayoral administrations of Sidney A. Marchand and his son Sidney Marchand, Jr., they directed the construction of significant infrastructure in Donaldsonville (including about 12 miles of paving, and the still-extant sewerage system). Today the Donaldsonville Historic District has what is described as the "finest collection of buildings from the pre-Civil War to 1933 period" of rivertowns above New Orleans.[5] It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In the 21st century, Donaldsonville is a small city with numerous historic sites. Since 2008, the River Road African American Museum, located in the city, has been included on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.[18] It also has parks, Civil War grounds, and shopping centers.
The official newspaper of the city is the Donaldsonville Chief, which has been published since 1871.[19]

Geography[edit]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.5 km2), all land. Coming upriver on the Mississippi, Donaldsonville is the point of the first expanse of land beyond the narrow natural levee. The city sits approximately 25 feet above sea level. Donaldsonville is located where Bayou Lafourche, a distributary of the Mississippi River, formerly branched off until the entrance was dammed in 1905.[20]

Montana Highway 3 (MT 3) is a highway in central Montana extending north from Billings to Great Falls.[2][3]

Route description[edit]
At its southern end, MT 3 begins at I-90 in Billings and travels northwest 47 miles (76 km) to US 12 near Lavina – this is the only section of MT 3 that is not concurrent with a US highway. MT 3 joins US 12 and travels 45 miles (72 km) west to Harlowton, where it leaves US 12 and joins US 191, and travels north for 39 miles (63 km) to Eddie's Corner (near Moore). At Eddie's Corner, MT 3 turns west, leaving US 191 and joining the US 87 / MT 200 concurrency, and travels west 65 miles (105 km) to Armington where US 89 joins the highway. The four highways continue 23 miles (37 km) to Great Falls, where it follows a 0.8-mile (1.3 km) concurrency with I-315 and ends at I-15.[1][3]
MT 3 is part of the Camino Real Corridor (Corridor 27), a High Priority Corridor that connects El Paso, Texas to the Canada–United States border at Sweet Grass, Montana. The corridor is anchored by Interstate 25 and is part of the larger Ports-to-Plains Alliance. MT 3 is connected to the Canadian border via I-15, and is connected to I-25 in Buffalo, Wyoming via I-90.[4]

The Roraiman warbler (Myiothlypis roraimae) is a species of passerine bird in the new world warbler family Parulidae. It is known to associate with Tepui rainforest ecosystems and is found in southern Venezuela, western Guyana, and adjacent areas of northern Brazil. The bird has been periodically granted full species status, although it has also been occasionally considered a subspecies of two-banded warbler (Myiothlypis bivittata). Based on the population's physically disparate distance from the nominate species, vocal differences, and slight differences in plumage, several authorities consider the Roraiman warbler independent.[2][3] Recent genetic evidence also indicates the birds of northern South America are significantly diverged from the two-banded warbler populations in the Andes.[4]

Description[edit]
The Roraiman warbler has a bright yellow throat and underparts with darker olive colored upperparts. The crown is black with an orange central stripe that may be difficult to see in the field. There is a short dusky eyestripe and broken yellow eyering below a yellow supercilium line fading to olive in the rear.

Occurrence data from AVH


Leucopogon stokesii is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae and is endemic to a small area in the south-west of Western Australia. It is an erect, open shrub with hairy young branchlets, narrowly elliptic leaves and erect, dense clusters of 5 to 10 bell-shaped white flowers on the ends of branches.


Description[edit]
Leucopogon stokesii is an erect, open shrub that typically grows up to about 1.6 m (5 ft 3 in) high and 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) wide, its young branchlets mainly covered with straight hairs. The leaves are spirally arranged, narrowly elliptic, 3.2–7.2 mm (0.13–0.28 in) long and 0.8–1.8 mm (0.031–0.071 in) wide on a creamy yellow to pale brown petiole 0.4–1.1 mm (0.016–0.043 in) long. Both surfaces of the leaves are glabrous, the upper surface glaucous and the lower surface darker and shiny. The flowers are arranged in groups of 5 to 10 on the ends of branchlets with narrowly egg-shaped bracts 1.4–3.1 mm (0.055–0.122 in) long, and egg-shaped bracteoles 1.2–1.5 mm (0.047–0.059 in) long. The sepals are egg-shaped, 2.0–2.9 mm (0.079–0.114 in) long, and the petals white and joined at the base to form a bell-shaped tube 1.3–1.8 mm (0.051–0.071 in) long, the lobes 2.4–3.0 mm (0.094–0.118 in) long, usually flushed with pink, widely spreading and densely bearded inside. The fruit is an oblong or elliptic drupe 1.8–2.5 mm (0.071–0.098 in) long.[2]

Taxonomy and naming[edit]
Leucopogon stokesii was first formally described in 2012 by Michael Clyde Hislop in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected near Arrino in 2009.[2][3] The specific epithet (stokesii) honours Dennis Stokes, on whose property this species occurs.[2]

Distribution and habitat[edit]
This leucopogon grows in dense heath on and near breakaways in a small area near Three Springs in the Avon Wheatbelt bioregion in the south-west of Western Australia.[2][4]

Conservation status[edit]
Leucopogon stokesii is listed as "Threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions,[4] meaning that it is in danger of extinction.[5]

The Walking Dead season 7List of episodes
"Hearts Still Beating" is the eighth episode and mid-season finale of the seventh season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on December 11, 2016. The episode was written by Matthew Negrate and Channing Powell, and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis.
The episode focuses on Negan's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) unwelcome and unexpected visit to Alexandria as other members scavenge for supplies; with tensions high, things quickly spin out of control. It also features the final appearances of Olivia (Ann Mahoney) and Spencer Monroe (Austin Nichols). His death was adapted from Issue #111 of the comic book series.[1]


Plot[edit]
At the Hilltop, Gregory warns Maggie not to let her growing popularity with the Hilltop residents go to her head. Maggie cannot locate Jesus and Sasha lies about his whereabouts, knowing he is looking for the Saviors' home, the Sanctuary.
At Alexandria, Negan tries to bond with Rick's son Carl while Rick and Aaron retrieve supplies from an abandoned houseboat floating in the middle of a walker-infested river, as part of their offering to the Saviors. Among the supplies are numerous guns, but no ammo, along with a vulgar note left by the previous owner sardonically congratulating them on their prize. They return to Alexandria, unaware they were watched by a man with mismatched boots. The Saviors check over the supplies and discover the vulgar note, believing it was written by Rick and Aaron for them. Aaron attempts to apologize, but the Saviors beat him up and Rick is unable to intervene.
At the Kingdom, Richard, a member of their military, pays Carol a visit inside her cottage, though Morgan is also there. Richard tries to persuade them both to have King Ezekiel consider fighting the Saviors, as he fears they may in fact kill them even if they continue to obey their demands. They debate and both staunchly refuse; Richard dejectedly leaves.
At the Sanctuary, with help from an anonymous source, Daryl is able to sneak out of his cell to a waiting motorcycle to escape. He encounters Fat Joey and bludgeons him to death with a pipe. Jesus finds Daryl and, together, they leave the compound, with Daryl recovering Rick's signature .357 Colt Python revolver from Joey's corpse. Nearby, Michonne has abducted a Savior woman and demands she show her the Sanctuary. The woman directs her to a nearby hill where Michonne sees that there are vast numbers of Saviors, more than they initially thought. The woman states it would be pointless to fight them and it would be better to just take the car and dump it, then adds that there is a silencer in the glove compartment. After a moment, Michonne kills her, dumps the body, and drives back to Alexandria.
Spencer, who has a vendetta against Rick, approaches Negan and proposes to talk. A pool table is set up outside and a crowd gathers, and as Negan plays, Spencer explains that Negan should name him as leader of Alexandria over Rick, since he will readily acquiesce to Negan's demands. Negan considers this, approaches Spencer and explains that unlike Rick, he has no guts and proceeds to disembowel him. Enraged, Rosita fires the single bullet that Eugene had made at Negan, but it strikes "Lucille", his bat. Savior Arat subdues Rosita while Negan demands to know who made the bullet. When Rosita lies and claims she did, Negan tells Arat to kill someone. Arat chooses and kills Olivia. By then, the gunfire has drawn Rick to the scene and he tries to confront Negan. Negan reminds him of his deal that no Alexandrian can have a firearm and Olivia's death was the penalty for disobedience. Eugene admits he made the bullet. Negan and the Saviors take their leave, taking Eugene with them. That night, Michonne convinces Rick that they must fight back against the Saviors and Rick finally accepts.
The next day, Rick, Michonne, Carl, Rosita, and Tara show up at the Hilltop, reuniting with Maggie, Sasha, and Enid. As they plan, Daryl and Jesus return to everyone's surprise. Rick and Daryl embrace, and Daryl returns his gun. The group makes plans to go to war with the Saviors.
At Alexandria that night, Father Gabriel keeps watch, unaware that the same figure with mismatched boots watches him from afar.

Kent C. Berridge[1] (born 1957) is an American academic, currently working as a professor of psychology (biopsychology) and neuroscience at the University of Michigan. Berridge was a joint winner of the 2018 Grawemeyer Award for Psychology.[2]


Early life and education[edit]
Berridge was born in 1957.[3] Berridge earned a Bachelor of Science from the University of California, Davis in 1979, followed by a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.[4]

Research[edit]
Berridge conducts research relating to brain systems of motivation, affect, reward “liking”, reward “wanting”, emotion, fear, pleasure, drug addiction, eating disorders, and decision utility. He also studies natural syntactical chains of behavior (e.g. grooming; taste response patterns) in animals with colleague Dr. J. Wayne Aldridge. With Dr. Piotr Winkielman, he has investigated the issue of unconscious emotion in humans.

Liking[edit]
Berridge is known for his work on the brain systems for pleasure (“liking”).[5] Using an assay for “liking” called Taste Reactivity Analysis developed by taste researchers, Berridge measures facial palatability responses to tastes, which are similar between rodents, primates and humans.[6] When something enjoyably sweet is tasted, characteristic licking responses occur. When something aversively bitter is tasted, gaping and head shaking occur. Berridge has helped identify "hedonic hotspots" in the brain, such as the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, where opioid, endocannabinoid, and GABA neurotransmission coordinate the “liking” of tastes. Berridge postulates that these hedonic hotspots may be crucial for how the brain produces the hedonic pleasurable feelings common to delicious food, sex, drugs, and other rewards (a role previously thought to be played mostly by brain dopamine systems).

Addiction[edit]
Berridge and colleague Dr. Terry Robinson have formulated a contemporary theory of addiction called the Incentive Sensitization Theory of Addiction.[7] According to this theory, drug addiction develops from a sensitization of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Dopamine normally functions to attribute incentive salience to stimuli associated with rewards like food and sex, and triggers reward “wanting”. Drugs hijack this “wanting” system. Following repeated use of drugs, the dopamine system becomes hyper-responsive and drug cues become hyper-salient. This means drug cues are nearly impossible for addicts to ignore, and when they are encountered they can lead to intense cravings and/or relapse. This sensitized cue-triggered drug 'wanting' can persist for years after an addict quits drugs, and long after drug withdrawal has ceased. This fact may account for the tendency of former addicts to relapse to drug use after quitting, sometimes even after many years of abstinence.

Dopamine[edit]
Berridge and Robinson helped redefine the role of mesolimbic dopamine in the brain,[8] which had previously been viewed as a pleasure neurotransmitter. Dopamine is no longer widely regarded as a pleasure transmitter. Instead, dopamine is thought to mediate reward, that is, to attribute incentive salience to reward-associated stimuli.

Bezmiâlem Sultan (Ottoman Turkish: بزم عالم سلطان; Ornament of The World; c. 1807 – 2 May 1853[1]), called also Bazimialam Sultan, was a consort of Sultan Mahmud II, and Valide sultan to their son, Sultan Abdulmejid I of the Ottoman Empire.


Early years[edit]
Bezmiâlem Kadın, called also Bazimialam,  was born in 1807 in Georgia.[2][3][4] She had been educated by Esma Sultan, a half-sister of Mahmud II and her favorite advisor,[5] and was said to have been buxom and a bath attendant before entering the imperial harem.[3][4] She had a beautiful face and extraordinary white and beautiful hands.[6]  She was considered really intelligent, although not formally educated. She became a consorts of Sultan Mahmud in 1822, and was given the title of "Third Kadın" and, on 1832, "Second Kadın".[7] On 25 April 1823, she gave birth to her only son, Şehzade Abdulmejid. (later Abdulmejid I) [8]

As Valide Sultan[edit]
Early years[edit]
Bezmiâlem became Valide Sultan, after Abdulmejid I, ascended to the throne in 1839.[4][9][8] One source says that Mahmud died of alcoholism, rather than tuberculosis, and she is reported to have convinced Abdulmejid to destroy his father's wine cellars.[10] Since her son was only sixteen, Bezmialem, that Abdumejid loved very much, although not a regent, assisted him in the administration of the state.
She was thirty one and was still young enough to despise and mistrust the elder non statesman who had made himself minister. She was known for her extremely pale complexion and her reddish blonde hair. She was slender, with very good looking fingers. She was very pale. She looked very young when she became the Valide Sultan. She advised her son to allow Koca Hüsrev Mehmed Pasha to incur the odium of seeking terms from Muhammad Ali of Egypt but urged him to resist the Grand Vizier's attempts to advance his nominees to important offices of the state. Abdulmejid duly played for time, awaiting Mustafa Reşid Pasha's return from England before taking any major decisions on policy. She gave a sound counsel. So shrewd was her judgement of men and their motives that she continued to influence the choice of ministers until shortly before her death fourteen years later. She also recommended Reşid to Abdulmejid because she believed he understood what Mahmud had been seeking to achieve in his reform programme.[4] She influenced the appointments of his son's ministers, inviting him to be wary of old but inexperienced men who sought his favor. A great supporter of her son's reforms and admirer of Europe, her shrewd and objective judgment was held in high esteem by the sultan, who consulted her regularly until her death. 
In 1842 Abdülmecid ordered new apartments for his mother on Yildiz Palace. Furnished and decorated in the French style, which was all the rage at the time in the Ottoman Empire, they took the name of Pavilion Kasr-i Dilküşa (Pavilion of the happy heart) and were only completed after Bazimialam's death. .[11] Charles White reported in 1844 that the revenues of Bezmiâlem came partly as an annuity from the civil list, and partly from real property, "the fruits of gifts and accumulation". He estimated her entirely yearly income at 100, 000 British pounds.[12]
Bezmiâlem was a lady of deep religious conviction, and benevolent nature.[13] She belonged to the Naqshbandi, a major Sunni spiritual order of Sufism. She was a believer, and follower of the Indian Muhammad Jan (died 1850).[14] Muhammad Jan was active as of the 1830s and succeeded in gaining many followers in Istanbul.[13] She also taught the orthodox principles of the Naqshbandi to Abdulmejid.[15]
Like Valide Sultan, she favored Georgian Circassians like herself in choosing consorts for her son.
Bezmiâlem earned a reputation as an intelligent, amiable and charitable woman, and she was among the most loved and respected Valid Sultans in history. Additionally, some ambassadors referred to her as the most influential Valide Sultan in centuries

Influence over Abdulmejid[edit]
A considerable influence was exercised over Abdulmejid by Bezmiâlem.[13] Both her dominant position in the harem and her special position with regard to her son are shown by the letters which she wrote to him when he was on a trip in Anatolia in 1850. She tells how his family watched him leave.[16] She often wrote letters to his son, whose poor grammar revealed her humble origins and poor formal education, to which he answered in person rather than through intermediaries. Bezmiâlem's personal seal read: Devletlü, ifetlü Valide Sultan-ı âlişan Hazretleri (His Excellency, His Majesty the chaste and honored Valide Sultan), while a second, more elaborate one read: Muhabbetten Muhammed oldu hâsılhammed Muhabbetten oldu hâsılhammed Muhabbetten old Hâmâmâmuza. When Abdülmecid left Istanbul he left the management of the capital to his mother.
At other times that the kadıns, were all asking for him; that she had herself taken the children to the bath; that every one prayed for him. She wanted news of his health. She had passed out the cloth he had sent to the kadıns, and to his sisters and brother. She wrote of the birth of twin sons to one of his ikbals, and finally letters of joy telling of the preparations for his return.[1]

Patroness of architecture[edit]
Like other influential Ottoman women, Bezmiâlem was a patron of arts and architecture. In 1845, she commissioned a wooden bridge at the Golden Horn, known as the Cisr-i Cedid (New Bridge), and Valide Bridge.[17] The same year, she commissioned the "Gurebâ-yi Müslimîn" hospital, fountain, and a mosque in Yenibahçe.[9] She also built another "Gurebâ-yi Müslimîn" hospital in Mecca.[18][19]
Bezmiâlem commissioned Çeşmes (fountains) throughout Istanbul. The first was built in Beşiktaş-Maçka in 1839, just after Abdulmejid ascended the throne. The second was built in 1841 in the Uzunyusuf neighborhood of Silivrikapı. The third known as the "Ülçer Fountain" was built in the Ülçer neighborhood of Sultanahmet in 1843. The same year she built another fountain in Topkapı. In 1846, another fountain was built in the Cihannüma neighbourhood of Beşiktaş. In 1852–3, another fountain was built in Tarabya. Two another were built in Alibeyköyü, and near the Galata Tower known as the "Bereketzade Fountain".[18][19]
She also repaired the fountain of Abdullah Agha in Silivrikapı in 1841, another fountain in Kasımpaşa also in 1841, and Mehmed the Conqueror's fountain in Topkapı in 1851. She also commissioned three Sebils. Two in Medina; one on the road to the grave of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, and another in 1851 near to the above-mentioned one, outside the Damascus Gate, in the vicinity of the so-called Sebil Bahçesi. A third was built in the courtyard of the shrine of Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala.[18][19]

Dolmabahçe Mosque of Bezmiâlem Sultan.
In 1850, Bezmiâlem founded the Dârülmaârif (Valide School), near the mausoleum of her husband, Sultan Mahmud. It was an institution that prepared civil servants for both government offices, and the demand for Dârülfünun. She also established a lithography printer in this school and donated 546 volumes of valuable writing books to its library by French authors, including Hugo, Lamartine, Baudelaire and Flaubert. Since 1933, the Istanbul Girls High School continues its education in this school. A primary school was also opened near it. She also founded another school in Beykoz, and another primary school in 1841 in the Akşı neighborhood of Edirnekapı Molla.[18][19]
Bezmiâlem also founded the Dolmabahçe Mosque near the Dolmabahçe Palace. Garabed Balyan, and his son Nigoğayos Balyan designed the mosque. The mosque consists of a small though lofty dome prayer hall that is preceded by an extensive, truly palatial looking pavilion. The architecture is Neoclassical through and through, with the two minarets designed as Corinthian columns up to their balconies.[20] The construction of the mosque began before her death was completed after her death.[21][22]

Death[edit]
Bezmiâlem Sultan died in the Beşiktaş Palace[23] on 2 May 1853,[8] of Tuberculosis then raging in Istanbul and was buried in the mausoleum of her husband Sultan Mahmud II located on the Divanyolu Street, Istanbul.[24][25]

Her son Abdülmecid honored her with a magnificent funeral, costing 79,000 kuruş, a fortune, and well described by Sir Adolphus Slade in his Turkey and the Crimean War: A Narrative of Historical Events (1867): Female screams at dawn in the palace of Beshik-tash, one morning in early May, announced her mourning [of Abdülmecid I] to the passing guards and caiks, and greeted the body which at that early hour was being transported to the caik empire, followed by other caiks with the retinue of the late lady [Bezmialem], to the old menagerie. He was there washed and perfumed according to custom, and lying on a coffin covered with clothing of gold and silver. Preceded by censers and choristers, he was then brought out from inside the palace and placed in the shade of the trees in the central courtyard for a few minutes, while the court imam recited a prayer for the souls of the dead. During his recital, the spectators, taking off their slippers, remained standing on their soles upside down: 
The procession was then formed. Military pashas on horseback, in single file, flanked by their grooms and tchiaushe on foot, led the way, followed by a compact body of Arab dervishes singing vigorously. Then three legal dignitaries rode, also in single file, the cazi-inquirers of Europe and Asia with the evcaf nazir. A body of Khamedes (royal servants) marched later in order. Then the ministers of state rode in single file; the last three are the Captain Pasha, the Scheick ul Islam and the Grand Vizier. After them rode a body of the Sultan's eunuchs, the leader of which, the kislar agasi, a melancholy-looking Nubian elder, immediately preceded the body. The eunuchs of the deceased, scattering newly minted silver coins among the crowd, closed the procession. As the procession passed through the streets, flanked at intervals by troops, numerous spectators in the open spaces sobbed loudly; and although oriental women always have tears and smiles on command, those shed on this occasion were sincere, since sex had lost a lawyer that day, the poor friend.

The procession stopped in front of the garden of Mahmoudieh's mausoleum, where, on an elevated slope, the children of the adjacent schools lined up, chanting hymns, and, reforming on foot, proceeded through gilded gates and rose gardens, slowly towards the tomb. When its portals opened, the women of the valeh gathered inside the building to pay the final tribute of respect to their gracious mistress uttered, sad and plaintive; mingle, strangely harmonious, with the songs of the dervishes and the neighing of the driven horses. The body was buried next to that of Sultan Mahmoud II. 
Issue[edit]
Together with Mahmud, Bezmiâlem had one son:

Sultan Abdulmejid I (25 April 1823 – 25 June 1861, buried in Yavuz Selim Mosque, Fatih). 31th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire.

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bezmiâlem_Sultan&oldid=1220765641"Broadcast encryption is the cryptographic problem of delivering encrypted content (e.g. TV programs or data on DVDs) over a broadcast channel in such a way that only qualified users (e.g. subscribers who have paid their fees or DVD players conforming to a specification) can decrypt the content.[1][2][3] The challenge arises from the requirement that the set of qualified users can change in each broadcast emission, and therefore revocation of individual users or user groups should be possible using broadcast transmissions, only, and without affecting any remaining users. As efficient revocation is the primary objective of broadcast encryption, solutions are also referred to as revocation schemes.[4][5][6]
Rather than directly encrypting the content for qualified users, broadcast encryption schemes distribute keying information that allows qualified users to reconstruct the content encryption key whereas revoked users find insufficient information to recover the key.[1] The typical setting considered is that of a unidirectional broadcaster and stateless users (i.e., users do not keep bookmarking of previous messages by the broadcaster), which is especially challenging.[4] In contrast, the scenario where users are supported with a bi-directional communication link with the broadcaster and thus can more easily maintain their state, and where users are not only dynamically revoked but also added (joined), is often referred to as multicast encryption.[7]
The problem of practical broadcast encryption has first been formally studied by Amos Fiat and Moni Naor in 1994.[1] Since then, several solutions have been described in the literature, including combinatorial constructions, one-time revocation schemes based on secret sharing techniques, and tree-based constructions.[2] In general, they offer various trade-offs between the increase in the size of the broadcast, the number of keys that each user needs to store, and the feasibility of an unqualified user or a collusion of unqualified users being able to decrypt the content. Luby and Staddon have used a combinatorial approach to study the trade-offs for some general classes of broadcast encryption algorithms.[3] A particularly efficient tree-based construction is the "subset difference" scheme, which is derived from a class of so-called subset cover schemes.[4] The subset difference scheme is notably implemented in the AACS for HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc encryption. A rather simple broadcast encryption scheme is used for the CSS for DVD encryption.
The problem of rogue users sharing their decryption keys or the decrypted content with unqualified users is mathematically insoluble. Traitor tracing algorithms aim to minimize the damage by retroactively identifying the user or users who leaked their keys, so that punitive measures, legal or otherwise, may be undertaken.[8][4] In practice, pay TV systems often  employ set-top boxes with tamper-resistant smart cards that impose physical restraints on a user learning their own decryption keys. Some broadcast encryption schemes, such as AACS, also provide tracing capabilities.[9]

It's Alec Templeton Time was an early American television program broadcast on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. The series ran during the summer of 1955. It was a musical program hosted by blind satirist and musician Alec Templeton. The program, produced and distributed by DuMont, aired on Friday nights on most DuMont affiliates.[1]
It's Alec Templeton Time has the distinction of being one of the last programs to air on the dying DuMont Television Network, along with Have a Heart (ended June 14, 1955), What's the Story (ended September 23, 1955) and Boxing from St. Nicholas Arena (ended August 6, 1956).[citation needed] The struggling network was already beginning to shut down network operations before It's Alec Templeton Time even aired its first episode, and Paramount Pictures would take control of DuMont during the summer; as a result, the series' run was brief, and did not last past the summer months.


Episode status[edit]
As is the case with most DuMont programs, nothing remains of the series today.[citation needed]

The Hillside Strangler, later the Hillside Stranglers, is the media epithet for one, later discovered to be two, American serial killers who terrorized Los Angeles, California, between October 1977 and February 1978, with the nicknames originating from the fact that many of the victims' bodies were discovered in the hills surrounding the city.[1]
One unusual twist to the investigation was the arrival in L.A. of a psychic from Berlin. Detective Bob Grogan was polite, but unenthusiastic, when the psychic wrote in German what they should be looking for: Two Italians. Brothers. Aged about thirty-five.[2] It was initially believed that only one person was responsible for the killings. The police, however, determined from the positions of the bodies that two criminals were working together, but withheld that information from the press. The perpetrators were eventually discovered to be cousins Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono Jr., who were later convicted of kidnapping, raping, torturing and murdering 10 women and girls ranging in age from 12 to 28.[3][4]
The Hillside Strangler murders began with the deaths of two prostitutes who were found strangled and dumped naked on hillsides northeast of Los Angeles in October and early November 1977. It was not until the deaths of five young women who were not prostitutes, but girls who had been abducted from middle-class neighborhoods, that the media attention and subsequent "Hillside Strangler" moniker came to prominence.[5]
There were two more deaths in December and February before the murders abruptly stopped. An extensive investigation proved fruitless until the arrest of Bianchi in January 1979 for the murder of two more young women in Washington and the subsequent linking of his past to the Strangler case.
The most expensive trial in the history of the California legal system at that time followed, with Bianchi and Buono eventually being found guilty of those crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment.


Background[edit]
Main articles: Kenneth Bianchi and Angelo Buono

Angelo Buono mugshot
In January 1976, Kenneth Bianchi left Rochester, New York, and moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his cousin Angelo Buono Jr.[6] Buono provided a strong role model for the docile Bianchi. When Bianchi was short of money, Buono came up with the idea of getting some girls to work for them as prostitutes.[7] Two teenage runaways, Sabra Hannan and Becky Spears, met Bianchi and Buono, and once under their control, were forced to prostitute themselves. Eventually, Spears happened to meet lawyer David Wood, who was appalled at her situation and arranged for her to escape from the city.[7]
Encouraged by Spears' escape, Hannan ran away from Bianchi and Buono a short time later. With their pimping income gone, they decided to find more teenage girls. Impersonating police officers, they eventually found another young woman and installed her in the previous girl's bedroom. Additionally, they purchased (from a prostitute named Deborah Noble) a supposed "trick list" with names of men who frequented prostitutes. Noble and her friend, Yolanda Washington, delivered the trick list to Buono in October 1977.[7]

Murders[edit]
Yolanda Washington[edit]
Yolanda Washington happened to mention to Buono that she always worked on a certain stretch of Sunset Boulevard. When Bianchi and Buono found that Deborah Noble had deceived them about the list but were unable to find her, they decided to take out their rage on Washington; her naked body was found on October 17, 1977, on a hillside near the Ventura Freeway. Detective Frank Salerno of the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department was called to the scene,[8] where it was determined that the corpse was cleaned before being dumped, while faint marks were also visible around the neck, wrists and ankles, signs of a rope being used. The victim had also been raped.[4]

Judith Miller[edit]
On November 1, 1977, police were called to Alta Terrace Drive in La Crescenta,[9] a neighborhood 12 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, where the body of a teenage girl was found naked, face up on a parkway in a middle-class residential area. The homeowner had covered her with a tarp in the early morning hours to prevent the neighborhood children from viewing her on their way to school.[8] Ligature marks were on her neck, wrists and ankles, indicating to police she was bound and strangled. The body had been dumped, indicating she was killed elsewhere.[8]
Detective Salerno also found a small piece of light-colored fluff on her eyelid and saved it for the forensic experts. A coroner's report further detailed that she had been raped and sodomized.[8] The girl, who was described as being "small and thin, weighing about 90 pounds and appearing to be about 16 years old",[8] was eventually identified as 15-year-old Judith Lynn Miller, a former student of Hollywood High School. After dropping out, Miller was a runaway and small-time sex worker.
Miller was last seen alive on Halloween, October 31, 1977, talking to a man driving a large, two-toned sedan on Sunset Boulevard next to Carney's. The stranglers had told her they were ‘undercover’ police officers, handcuffed her, and took her to Buono's Auto Upholstery Shop at 703 E. Colorado St. in Glendale, where she was murdered.

Lissa Kastin[edit]
Five days later, on November 6, 1977, the nude body of another woman was discovered near the Chevy Chase Country Club in Glendale. Like Miller, her body bore five-point (neck, wrists, and ankles) ligature marks, and showed signs of having been strangled and brutally raped, but not sodomized.[8] The woman was identified as 21-year-old waitress Elissa Teresa "Lissa" Kastin, who was last seen leaving the restaurant where she worked the night before her body was discovered.[10]
In addition to working full-time, Kastin was also a professional dancer in the all-female dance troupe The L.A. Knockers and (unlike the previous two victims) was not a prostitute, drug user or runaway. The stranglers followed Kastin after she was seen driving home from work, pulled her over on the street she lived on, presented a fake ‘police badge’, and told her that they were detectives. They then handcuffed her and told her they needed to take her in for questioning.[10]

Aborted abduction of Catharine Lorre Baker[edit]
At some point in early November 1977,[11] the two men approached 24-year-old Catharine Lorre Baker, the daughter of actor Peter Lorre — famous for his role as a serial killer in Fritz Lang's film M — with the intent of abducting and killing her. However, when Lorre produced not only her driver's license when requested, but also a picture of her sitting on her father's lap as a child, the two let her go without incident, fearing the murder of a celebrity's child would attract an unusually high amount of police and press attention.[12]
Lorre did not realize who the men were until they were arrested, at which point she recalled that two men flashing L.A. police badges had approached her in the past.[13]

Dolores Cepeda (left) and Sonja Johnson
Dolores Cepeda and Sonja Johnson[edit]
On Sunday, November 13, 1977, two girls, 12-year-old Dolores Ann "Dolly" Cepeda and 14-year-old Sonja Marie Johnson,[14] boarded an RTD bus in front of the Eagle Rock Plaza on Colorado Boulevard and headed home. The last time they were seen was getting off the bus on York Boulevard and North Avenue 46, and approaching a two-tone sedan that reportedly had two men inside. Their two corpses were discovered by a 9-year-old boy who was treasure-hunting in a trash heap on a hillside near Dodger Stadium on November 20, 1977.[15] Both of the girls' bodies had already begun to decompose. It was determined that they had been strangled and raped.[10]

Kristina Weckler[edit]
Earlier that same day, November 20, 1977, hikers found the naked body of 20-year-old Kristina Weckler, a quiet, unassuming honors student at the Art Center College of Design, described by Detective Bob Grogan of the Los Angeles Police Department as a "…loving and serious young woman who should have had a bright future ahead of her".[15] Weckler was discovered on a hillside between Glendale and Eagle Rock. When found by Detective Grogan, the typical ligature marks were on her wrists, ankles, and neck, and when he turned her over, bruises were observed on her breasts and blood oozed from her rectum. Unlike the first three victims, there were two puncture marks on her arm, but no signs of the needle tracks that indicated a drug addict;[16] it was later determined that Weckler had been injected with Windex, a common ammonia-based  window, glass and hard-surface cleaner.[10]

Evelyn Jane King[edit]
On November 23, 1977, the badly decomposed body of 28-year-old Evelyn Jane King, an aspiring actress who had gone missing on November 9, was discovered in bushes[17] near the Los Feliz Boulevard off-ramp of the Golden State Freeway.[15] The severity of decomposition prevented determination as to whether she had been raped or tortured, but she had been strangled like the others. In response authorities created a task force — initially composed of 30 officers from the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department and the Glendale Police Department — to catch the predator now dubbed the "Hillside Strangler".[15]

Lauren Rae Wagner
Lauren Wagner[edit]
On November 29, 1977, police found the body of 18-year-old Lauren Rae Wagner, a business student who lived with her parents in the San Fernando Valley,[10] in the hills around Los Angeles's Mount Washington. She had ligature marks on her neck, ankles, and wrists. There were also burn marks on her hands indicating she was tortured.[18] Lauren's parents had expected her to come home before midnight, and the next morning, when they found her car parked across the street with the door ajar, her father questioned the neighbors.[18]
He found that the woman who lived in the house where Lauren's car had been parked saw her abduction. This woman stated that she saw two men: one was tall and young, the other one was older and shorter with bushy hair.[18] She also stated that she heard Wagner cry out "You won't get away with this!" during her abduction.[18]

Kimberly Martin[edit]
On December 14, 1977, the naked body of 17-year-old prostitute Kimberly Diane Martin, which also showed signs of torture, was found on a deserted lot near Los Angeles City Hall. Martin had previously joined a call girl agency because she feared exposing herself on the streets with the Strangler on the loose. The killers happened to place a call to her agency from a Hollywood Public Library pay phone, and she was the call girl who was dispatched. When the police investigated the apartment she had been dispatched to, they found it vacant and broken into.[19]

Cindy Hudspeth[edit]
The body of the final Hillside Strangler victim was discovered in Los Angeles on February 17, 1978, when a helicopter pilot spotted an orange Datsun abandoned midway down a cliff on the Angeles Crest Highway.[10] Police responded to the scene and discovered the nude body of the car's owner, 20-year-old Cindy Lee Hudspeth — a student and part-time waitress — in the trunk. Her corpse again showed ligature marks, and she had been raped and tortured. She had been strangled and her body placed in the trunk of her car, which was then pushed off the cliff.[19]
Hudspeth's murder had initially been unplanned. Bianchi had arrived at Buono's upholstery shop at closing time on February 16 to discover Hudspeth in the company of Buono, discussing upholstery work she wished him to perform on her car. The two men had a private discussion, opting to make her their next victim.[20]

Investigation and trial[edit]
In January 1979, after an intense investigation, police charged Bianchi and Buono with the crimes. Bianchi had fled to Bellingham, Washington, where he was soon arrested by Bellingham Police Department for raping and murdering two women he had lured to a home for a house-sitting job. Bianchi attempted to set up an insanity defense, claiming that he had dissociative identity disorder and that a personality separate from himself committed the murders. Court psychologists, notably Dr. Martin Orne, observed Bianchi and found that he was faking, so Bianchi agreed to plead guilty and testify against Buono in exchange for leniency.
At the conclusion of Buono's trial in 1983, Presiding Judge Ronald M. George, who later became Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court, stated during sentencing, "I would not have the slightest reluctance to impose the death penalty in this case were it within my power to do so. Ironically, although these two defendants utilized almost every form of legalized execution against their victims, the defendants have escaped any form of capital punishment."[21] Bianchi is serving a life sentence at the Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla. Buono died of a heart attack on September 21, 2002, at Calipatria State Prison in California, where he was serving a life sentence.[22]

Veronica Compton[edit]
In 1980, Bianchi began a relationship with Veronica Compton. During his trial, she testified for the defense. While incarcerated, Bianchi had smuggled a semen filled condom to her in the spine of a book to use to make it look like a rape/murder committed by the Hillside Strangler. She was later convicted and imprisoned for attempting to strangle a woman she had lured to a motel in an attempt to have authorities believe that the Hillside Strangler was still on the loose and the wrong man was imprisoned. She was released in 2003.

Maggie Jones (March 1894 – March 9, 1940)[5][6] was an American blues singer and pianist who recorded thirty-eight songs between 1923 and 1926. She was billed, alternately, as "The Texas Moaner"[2][3] and "The Texas Nightingale".[4] Among her best-remembered songs are "Single Woman's Blues", "Undertaker's Blues", and "Northbound Blues".[6]


Biography[edit]
Jones was born in Hillsboro, Texas,[5][6] to Pomp and Augusta Jones (né Craige).[1][7][8] Her birth name is sometimes given as Fae Barnes, and her year of birth as 1900, but the researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc state that she was born in 1894 and that "Fae Barnes" was a stage name.[5][1] She relocated to New York in 1922, where she performed in nightclubs. She appeared at the Princess Theater in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in 1922, and toured the Theater Owners Booking Association circuit until about 1926.[9]
Her debut recording session was on July 26, 1923, for Black Swan Records, where she was the first singer from Texas to record. She recorded for several record labels, including Black Swan, Victor, Pathé and Paramount, but most of her work was released by Columbia. On Black Swan and Paramount, she was billed as Fae (or Fay) Barnes; on Pathé and Columbia she recorded as Maggie Jones.[10]
Over a three-year period, she was accompanied by such notables as Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Charlie Green, and Elmer Snowden. Jones is especially noted for the six sides on which she was backed by Henderson and Armstrong; the writer Derrick Stewart-Baxter singled out "Good Time Flat Blues" as "her masterpiece".[11] A song titled "Anybody Here Want to Try My Cabbage" was recorded by Jones on December 10, 1924, and this was released as a single on March 30, 1925.[12] That song was written by Andy Razaf, Edgar Dowell and Fats Waller. Jones recording used the backing accompaniment of Armstrong and Henderson. With Henderson and Green she recorded "North Bound Blues", with lyrics containing trenchant references to the South's Jim Crow laws, which was unusual for a classic female blues singer.[11] In 1925, Jones recorded four songs written by Tom Delaney, including "If I Lose, Let Me Lose (Mamma Don't Mind)".[13] By October 3, 1926, Jones had cut her final disc. In 1927, she performed with the Clarence Muse Vaudeville Company and sang in Hall Johnson's choir at the Roxy Theater in New York City.[9]
In 1928–1929, Jones appeared with Bill Robinson in the Broadway production of Lew Leslie's revue Blackbirds of 1928, which toured the United States and Canada.[9] She often worked outside the music industry, including co-owning a clothes store in New York. By the early 1930s Jones moved on to Dallas, Texas, and ran her own revue troupe, which performed in Fort Worth. In the winter and spring of 1938, she performed at a variety of local venues,[14][15][16] concluding with a June 15 appearance alongside film and recording star Herb Jeffries, broadcast live from Ft. Worth's Grand Theater.[17] Jones subsequently disappeared from the public eye.[4][6] She died in Fort Worth of acute myocarditis on March 9, 1940.[6]
Her total recorded output is available on Maggie Jones, Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order, Vol. 1 (August 1923 to April 1925) and Maggie Jones, Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order, Vol. 2 (May 1925 to June 1926) (with Gladys Bentley, Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order (1928/1929)).

Libor MichálekSenator from Prague 2In office20 October 2012 – 13 October 2018Preceded byDaniela FilipiováSucceeded byMarek Hilšer
Personal detailsBorn (1968-12-12) 12 December 1968 (age 55)Náchod, CzechoslovakiaNationalityCzechPolitical partyPirateOther politicalaffiliationsGreen, Christian DemocratChildrenthreeAlma materPalacký University of Olomouc, Masaryk University, Nottingham Trent University (MPA)OccupationFinancial analyst
Libor Michálek (born 1968[1]) is a Czech economist, politician, and whistleblower. He led successful corruption cases against the Czech National Property Fund and the Environment Ministry as former employees of both.[2][3] He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to office in a national legislature.[4] His senatorial term was 2012–2018.[5]


Early life and career[edit]
Libor Michálek was born in Náchod in 1968.[1] He graduated from high school in Přerov in 1987, and from Palacký University of Olomouc in 1992.[1][6] He later studied in Masaryk University's management program,[1] and received his MPA from Nottingham Trent University's executive program in 2010.[6] After college, he worked as a UNIX programmer, business school teacher, and portfolio manager at an investment company.[6] Michálek was a broker at the National Property Fund from 1994 to 1996,[1][6] when he was fired after exposing a tunneling embezzlement scheme.[2][7] The resulting court case found that he was improperly dismissed.[7] He was later involved in compensating victims of financial crime.[3][8] Michálek served as a capital market supervisor at the Czech Ministry of Finance from 1997 to 1998, a director at the Czech Securities Commission from 1998 to 2006, a director at the Czech National Bank from 2006 to 2007, a senior consultant at the World Bank in 2007, and the chief financial market inspector at the Czech National Bank from 2008 to 2010.[6]
In August 2010, he became the director of the Czech State Environmental Fund.[1] On 13 December 2010, Michálek filed a criminal complaint of corruption against the Environment Ministry in its tender for reconstruction of a Prague water treatment plant.[3][9] He claimed the project was overpriced by Kč 3,000,000,000.[3] Based on a secretly audiotaped conversation, Michálek also alleged that Martin Knetig, an advisor to environmental minister Pavel Drobil, asked him to manipulate the tender to fund his party (the Civic Democrats) and Drobil's political career.[10] Michálek recorded his subsequent conversation with Drobil, who allegedly offered his deputy position for the destruction of the tapes.[2][10] Upon the story's publication, Drobil fired Michálek and Knetig,[10][11][9] denied any wrongdoing,[2][12] and resigned a day later.[3][10]
Prime Minister Petr Nečas defended Drobil, and called Michálek untrustworthy despite his public reputation as a whistleblower.[7] Since the Civic Democrats vowed to fight corruption, losing its first minister to corruption charges was a blow to the party's standing.[13][14] The Drobil incident was the first of several high-profile resignations.[15] On 21 December 2010, Czech Police Chief Oldrich Martinu resigned after Interior Minister Radek John's month-long call for his ouster in part due to the Drobil case's mishandling.[16] Michálek returned to the State Environmental Fund as a financial analyst in 2011.[6] The Drobil case is on indefinite hiatus for a lack of evidence as of September 2012.[17] As of February 2013, the case against Knetig is on a similar hiatus for insufficient evidence.[18]
Michálek is married and has three children.[19] He is a devout evangelical Christian.[7][20]

The Senate[edit]

At the end of July 2012, Libor Michálek accepted the Czech Pirate, Green, and Christian Democrat Party senatorial nominations for District 26.[21][4][22] The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms.[4][23] His personal 12-point platform prioritized direct democracy, fair political party competition, and anti-corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms.[24][25] In the October 2012 elections, he won 24.3 percent of the first round vote and 74.4 percent of the first-past-the-post runoff, giving him the seat.[4][23] Another candidate, Karel Berka, challenged the decision,[26] but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded.[27][28] He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office, the 81-seat Czech Senate.[4][29] His senatorial term was 2012–2018.[5]
Czech President Miloš Zeman has publicly considered Michálek for leading the Supreme Audit Office.[30] In 2013, Michálek authored the first bill designed to protect whistleblowers, which was overwhelmingly rejected on the floor of the Senate.[31]

Awards[edit]
In March 2011, Michálek was awarded first prize from the Endowment Fund Against Corruption for his whistleblowing role in the Environment Ministry corruption scandal.[32] In May 2011, he was awarded the František Kriegel Prize by the Charter 77 Foundation for his "brave, consistent and uncompromising fight against corruption in government."[2][33]

Daschly (Dasli) is an oasis in the north of Afghanistan which is on the south side of Amu Darya located in the Jowzjan Province. During archaeological investigations, 41 ancient sites were located here which two of these sites are of particular importance.[1][2]
Daschly 1 is a 99 x 85 m large castle with round corner towers and has about 3 to 4 m high walls that once perhaps were up to 8 m high. Inside the walling there are remains of what was presumably a completely roofed-over dense building, with no alleys or paths. In addition to the castle, there are remains of a town that was once probably inhabited by local rulers. 
Daschly 3 (37/07 N - 66/26 E) was a big palace of about 88 × 84 m high. It had a square interior with residential buildings and fortified outer walls that were laid out in a T-shape. After this palace was abandoned, a rectangular castle with a side length of about 150 × 130 m high with surroundings of deep moats was built here. Inside of it there is a dense development that leaves hardly any space for paths or alleys. The interior is divided by three walls. In the center there is a heavily fortified building, which once might have been a palace. Around the environment outside of the castle there are two more round wall rings, each separating one residential area from the next. 
The complexes probably date to the middle of the second millennium BC and belong to the oasis culture.

Jastrzębie-Zdrój Agreement (Polish: Porozumienie jastrzebskie) was an accord, signed on September 3, 1980, at Manifest Lipcowy Coal Mine in Jastrzębie-Zdrój, between the authorities of the People's Republic of Poland, and the Jastrzebie-Zdroj Interfactory Strike Committee. The agreement was signed by a government envoy Aleksander Kopec, and leader of the committee, Jaroslaw Sienkiewicz.  It was the last of the three accords, signed in late summer of 1980 in Poland. These accords resulted in creation of Solidarity, and as such, Jastrzębie-Zdrój Agreement is regarded as part of the August Agreements.
Coal miners from Upper Silesian city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój went on strike in late August 1980 (see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes), and during negotiations with the government, they based their demands on the 21 demands of MKS, to which the miners added their own points. After lengthy negotiations, Polish government accepted the agreement, and among accepted demands of the miners, were:

steady rise in salaries in connection with rising costs of living,
introduction of work-free weekends,
introduction of minimum pay and maximum number of working hours,
lowering of retirement age for those miners who work underground (presented to the Sejm for acceptance),
abolition of four-shift system at some mines,
extra financial bonuses for those miners who lived away from their families,
recognition of pneumoconiosis as an occupational disease,
improvement in deliveries of meats and meat products
coal bonuses for all coal mining industry workers,
limits of government administration.

Princely arms of the family
The House of Lobkowicz (Lobkovicové in modern Czech, sg. z Lobkovic; Lobkowitz in German) is a Czech[1] noble family that dates back to the 14th century and is one of the oldest Bohemian noble families.[2] The family also belongs to the German, Austrian and Belgian nobility. The first Lobkowiczs were members of the gentry of north-eastern Bohemia in the late 14th century. The family's Imperial immediacy over Princely county of Störnstein was mediatized by Bavaria in 1807. As such, the House of Lobkowicz belong to the small group of families that constitute the Hochadel (German for 'high nobility') and is one of the mediatised houses.

Notable family members[edit]
Mikuláš Chudý ("the Poor") z Újezda (c. 1378–1435) was a poor squire from the village of Újezd in Bohemia. After studying at the Charles University in Prague, he became a scribe in Kutná Hora. King Wenceslaus IV rewarded him for his services with the title to the village of Lobkovice (after which he began styling himself Nicholas of Lobkowicz), and he became the supreme scribe of the Bohemian kingdom in 1417. At the king's command, he captured several castles belonging to rebellious nobles; he was allowed to keep one, Hasištejn Castle, as a hereditary possession.
Nicholas Hasištejnský z Lobkowicz (died 1462). The elder son of Nicholas of Lobkowicz, he inherited Hasištejn Castle. He and his brother Jan were raised to the status of free lords by Emperor Frederick III in 1459. Twenty years later, they were awarded Czech lordly status as well.
Jan Popel z Lobkowicz (died 1470) was the younger son of Nicholas of Lobkowicz. He inherited Hluboká Castle and the village of Lobkovice from his father's estate. Along with his elder brother Nicholas, he was ennobled in 1459.
Jan Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (1450–1517) was a diplomat who traveled on ambassadorial missions to Luxembourg in 1477 and Rome in 1487. King Vladislaus II entrusted him with negotiating his marriage to Mary of Burgundy, but the match ultimately never occurred. Much like his younger brother Bohuslav, the so-called “Czech Ulysses,” Jan journeyed to the Holy Land, later writing a book about his experiences (Pilgrimage to the Holy Grave in Jerusalem, 1505). He helped develop a Franciscan monastery in Kadaň, and is buried there.
His brother Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (1461–1510) was a poet, essayist, and philosopher. He was well known for his prose, letters, and verses, including a satire on life in Bohemia. An extensive traveler who studied in Bologna and Ferrara and who voyaged to Egypt and the Holy Land, Bohuslav was elected Bishop of Olomouc but never held that office, as the pope refused to appoint him. He collected more than 650 books, primarily humanist and classical texts—an astonishing number for the era in which he lived. Roughly two thirds of his collection remains in the Lobkowicz Library, including more than 400 of the 750 incunabula belonging to the library.
Krystof Popel the Younger of Lobkowicz (1549–1609) was the Chief Steward of Bohemia during the reign of Emperor Rudolf II. Kryštof was a close friend of Hans von Aachen, the celebrated court painter. Known for his diplomatic and linguistic skills, he was often tasked with welcoming foreign visitors—including Persians, Turks, and Russians—to the Emperor's court, and was responsible for peace negotiations with the Polish king Sigismund.
Jiří Popel z Lobkowicz (c. 1551–1607 or 1613) was a devout Catholic nobleman who founded a Jesuit college in Chomutov and reestablished a monastery in Kadaň after it had been abolished due to connections with Lutheranism. Influential at the Imperial Court, in 1585 he became the Court Administrator, the second-highest office in Bohemia. However, he soon fell out of favor with Emperor Rudolf II, who blamed him and the other councillors for his brother Maximilian's defeat at the Battle of Byczyna and subsequent imprisonment. In 1593, he and his brother Ladislav Popel z Lobkowicz led an unsuccessful revolt against Rudolf II among the nobility. The two brothers fled Prague and were sentenced to death in absentia; Jiří was captured, but the Emperor lessened his sentence to life imprisonment and loss of property. He remained in prison for the rest of his life; the date of his death is unknown, but the years most frequently cited are 1607 and 1613.
Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkovic (c. 1575–1647). On 15 June 1587, he inherited the lordship of Horšovský Týn, which his father, John the Younger, had purchased in 1546. He was a royal councillor, and a court justice from 1628 to 1634. Being a Protestant, he was dispossessed in favour of the Catholic Lobkowicz line after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620.
Zdeněk Vojtěch Popel z Lobkovic (1568–1628), 1st Prince Lobkowicz
Zdeněk Vojtěch Popel z Lobkovic (1568–1628), 1st Prince Lobkowicz, was Chancellor to the Czech Kingdom under Emperors Rudolf II, Matthias, and Ferdinand II. Zdeněk Vojtěch was a major political figure in both Bohemia and the larger Habsburg empire. He and his wife Polyxena Pernštejn (1566–1642), the daughter of a Chancellor to the Czech Kingdom and an influential Spanish noblewoman, were leaders of the “Spanish” (i.e. Catholic) bloc at court, opposed to the Protestant factions. When the Emperor's Catholic ministers were hurled from the windows of Prague Castle in the famous Defenestration of Prague in 1618, they took refuge in the nearby Lobkowicz Palace. The incident also signalled a turning point in the fortunes of the Lobkowicz family: although their property was confiscated by rebellious Protestants in 1618, the Catholic victory at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 resulted in the restoration of their property and ensured that the family, as Catholic nobles, would continue to be highly influential. That same year, King Philip III of Spain awarded Zdeněk Vojtěch the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest order of European chivalry. In 1624, Ferdinand II granted him the title of Imperial Prince, and he became the first hereditary Prince Lobkowicz.
Polyxena Pernštejn (1566–1642), 1st Princess Lobkowicz, was the daughter of Vratislav of Pernštejn (1530–1582), Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom, and Maria Maximiliana Manrique de Lara y Mendoza (1538–1608), an influential Spanish noblewoman. In 1587, she became the fourth wife of William of Rosenberg (1535–1592), High Treasurer and High Burgrave of Bohemia and the wealthiest man in the country. After William's death, she married Zdeněk Vojtěch of Lobkowicz, Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom and later 1st Prince Lobkowicz. As all of William's marriages had been childless, Polyxena's marriage to Zdeněk Vojtěch brought considerable wealth and property into the Lobkowicz family. Polyxena and her husband were highly influential at the Imperial Habsburg court, where they spearheaded Catholic opposition to Protestant factions. After the Defenestration of Prague in 1618, the Emperor's Catholic ministers took refuge in the Lobkowicz Palace. A later painting shows a romanticized version of the incident, with Polyxena barring the door of the palace against a Protestant mob while the battered ministers cower behind her—while another version of events claims that Polyxena concealed the ministers under her skirts. The defeat of the Protestants at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 ensured that the Lobkowicz family would continue to play a major role in Bohemian and Imperial politics.
Kateřina Benigna Popelovna Lobkowicz (1594–1653), wife of Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkowicz, helped establish Loreta as a significant pilgrimage destination in Prague. She financed the construction of the site, which was designed by Italian architect Giovanni Orsi and built between 1626 and 1631.
Anna Magdalene (1606–1668), Baroness Popel von Lobkowicz, was the daughter of William the Younger Popel of Lobkowicz, Lord of Horšovský Týn. She married Julius Henry, Imperial Field Marshal and future Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, in 1632. Of their six children, two survived infancy. The youngest, Julius Francis (1641–1689), was the last Ascanian duke of Saxe-Lauenburg.
Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (1606–1682) was a Spanish Catholic philosopher, mathematician, architect and architectural theorist, ecclesiastic, and writer, believed to be a grandson of the eldest daughter of Jan Popel z Lobkowicz (c. 1527- 1590). After a precocious childhood, he entered the Cistercian Order and was later awarded a doctorate of theology by the University of Leuven. His titles and positions included Philip IV of Spain's envoy to the court of Emperor Ferdinand III; Abbot of Melrose, Scotland; Abbot-Superior of the Benedictines of Vienna; Grand Vicar to the Archbishop of Prague; Bishop of Satrianum; Bishop of Campagna; and, at his death, Bishop of Vigevano. His intellectual pursuits were no less illustrious: he published 262 works on subjects from poetry to astronomy to asceticism, was one of the earliest scholars to write on probability, and designed the façade of the Vigevano Cathedral. When the Swedes attacked Prague in 1648, he armed and led a band of ecclesiastics to serve in defense of the city, and the emperor rewarded him for his bravery with a collar of gold.
Václav Eusebius František, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz (1609–1677)
Václav Eusebius František (1609–1677), 2nd Prince Lobkowicz, was the only child of Zdeněk Vojtěch and Polyxena Pernštejn, and became one of the most influential European statesmen of the 17th century. He raised his own regiment to fight in the Thirty Years' War and held high offices at the Habsburg court, advising Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I in his capacity as President of the Imperial War Cabinet (from 1652) and President of the Imperial Privy Council (from 1669). He had a close connection with the Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain, Leopold I's young wife. The Lobkowicz Collections’ portrait of the Infanta (attributed to Velázquez) was presumably acquired during Leopold's reign. He also transformed his family's properties, overseeing the remodeling of the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague by Italian Baroque artists and the reconstruction of Roudnice Castle from a ruin to the family seat, and purchasing the ducal estate of Sagan in Silesia from Ferdinand III in 1646.
František Vilém (1616–1670), the fourth son of Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkowicz, served as a councillor to Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I between 1647 and 1659. He was rewarded with the title of Highest Hunter in the Kingdom of Bohemia, a hereditary honor.
Ferdinand August (1655–1715), 3rd Prince Lobkowicz, was a painting connoisseur whose additions to the Lobkowicz Collections include Veronese's David with the Head of Goliath, Rubens's Hygieia and the Sacred Serpent, Pieter Brueghel the Younger’s Village in Winter and Jan Brueghel the Elder’s St. Martin Dividing His Cloak. In addition to his own acquisitions, his wives also brought paintings as their dowries. The first, Claudia Franziska von Nassau Hadamar, brought with her portraits from the house of Nassau as well as a series of amateur portraits painted by her mother. The second, Maria Anna von Baden, brought a variety of Northern paintings, including Lucas Cranach the Elder's The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine of Alexandria and Cranach the Younger's Jesus and the Woman Taken in Adultery. Ferdinand August was also the first Prince Lobkowicz to systematically collect musical scores, and was an accomplished lutenist.
Wenzel Ferdinand (1656–1697), Count of Bílina. As well as being Count of Bílina, a Bohemian town famous for its healing mineral water, Wenzel Ferdinand was an Imperial councillor and chamberlain. He served as an envoy to Bavaria, France, Spain, England, and the Netherlands. While in the Netherlands, he commissioned a Delft service from Lambertus Cleffius – the earliest and largest Delft service still in existence.
Philip Hyacinth (1680–1734), 4th Prince Lobkowicz, was a patron of the arts who collected musical scores on several journeys to England. The composer Sylvius Leopold Weiss, one of the finest lutenists of his day, taught music to both Philip Hyacinth and his second wife Anna Maria Wilhelmina von Althan, and dedicated several works to the princess.
Eleonore, Princess Lobkowicz (1682–1741) was the daughter of Ferdinand August, 3rd Prince Lobkowicz. At the beginning of the 18th century, she had the mineral spring at Bílina cleaned, leading to the town becoming a well-known spa. In 1701 she married Adam Franz Eusebius, hereditary Prince von Schwarzenberg, whom Emperor Charles VI killed in a hunting accident in 1732. Subsequently, the Emperor took her son Joseph Adam to his court in Vienna, and she was paid a baronial maintenance of 5,000 gulden.
Eleonora Carolina (1685–1720), Countess of Bílina. The daughter and sole heir of Count Wenzel Ferdinand, she married her distant cousin Philip Hyacinth, 4th Prince Lobkowicz.
Johann Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz (1686–1755). A field marshal of the Imperial forces, Georg Christian was the fourth son of Ferdinand August, 3rd Prince Lobkowicz. He commanded the Lobkowicz regiment founded during the Thirty Years' War by Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz, and was commander-in-chief of the Habsburg armies in Italy. The Lobkowicz Collections holds portraits of eighteen officers that served in the Lobkowicz regiment under his command.
Ferdinand Philip (1724–1784), 6th Prince Lobkowicz. After Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Silesia during the War of the Austrian Succession, Ferdinand Philip supported Frederick over Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in order to protect his huge and highly profitable Silesian estate, originally acquired by Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz. It was probably for this reason that he was one of only two reigning princes of Lobkowicz not to be awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest Austrian order of chivalry. Wishing to avoid the war in Silesia and Bohemia but unwelcome at the Habsburg court in Vienna, Ferdinand Philip spent much of the 18th century in England, accompanied by Christoph Willibald Gluck, whom he had employed in the Lobkowicz Palace orchestra. He returned to Bohemia with two of Canaletto's finest paintings of London. His shrewd protection of his Silesian estate paid off: after his death, it was sold to the Duke of Courland for the incredible (at the time) sum of one million gulden.
Joseph František Maximilian (1772–1816), 7th Prince Lobkowicz, was a patron of Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Despite the previous Prince of Lobkowicz's lack of support for Maria Theresa, Joseph František Maximilian remained on good terms with the Habsburgs: Emperor Joseph II granted him the title of Duke of Roudnice in 1786, and to celebrate the coronation of Emperor Leopold II as King of Bohemia in 1791 he commissioned a reconstruction of the Lobkowicz Palace's exterior, giving it the appearance that it retains to this day. A talented singer, violinist, and violoncellist, Joseph František Maximilian was a noted patron of the arts: he was a founding member of the Society of the Friends of Music in Vienna, a member of the Society for the Promotion of Musical Culture in Bohemia, and a director of the Court Theatre of Vienna. He made his greatest impact on the musical world as a patron of Beethoven, who dedicated several major works to him, including the 3rd (Eroica), 5th, and 6th (Pastoral) symphonies.
Ferdinand Joseph Johann Nepomuk (1797–1868), 8th Prince Lobkowicz. A notable industrialist as well as a patron of the arts, he was a particular benefactor of the geologist and paleontologist August Emanuel von Reuss. In 1835 he established one of the largest sugar factories in Bohemia, in the town of Bílina. He served as a member of parliament in Bohemia from 1860 to 1863.
Karl Johann Josef of Lobkowicz (1815–1879). After having been head of government from 1852 to 1856, he served as a privy councillor in 1857. He was a stadholder in Lower Austria, Moravia, and Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the late 1850s and early 1860s.
Moric (1831–1903), 9th Prince Lobkowicz. He served as an Imperial Privy Councilor beginning in 1890.
Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz (1835–1908) was a political leader among the conservative Bohemian nobility. Georg Christian was a member of the Bohemian Diet from 1865 to 1872 and 1883 to 1907, presiding over it twice as Land Marshal of Bohemia. He served as deputy in the Austrian Parliament from 1879 to 1883 and became a hereditary member of the Austrian House of Lords in 1883.
Ferdinand Zdenko Maria (1858–1938), 10th Prince Lobkowicz. In 1907, he was appointed chamberlain to Archduke Charles, later Charles I of Austria, the last ruler of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Wilhelmina(1863–1945)[3] was the daughter of Moric, 9th Prince Lobkowicz. She sponsored a religious institution for widowed and unmarried noblewomen, The Order of the Sisters of God's Love, in Nelahozeves Castle. She was the last Lobkowicz to live in the castle, and is buried in the Nelahozeves village cemetery.
Ferdinand Lobkowicz (1885–1953), known as "the Evangelist". He was the eldest son of Ferdinand Zdenko Maria, 10th Prince Lobkowicz, but renounced his inheritance rights in 1920. His younger brother Maximilian inherited the family's properties instead.
Maximilian Lobkowicz (1888–1967). Despite the government's decision to redistribute inherited property and abolish the use of noble titles, Maximilian provided crucial support to the newly formed, democratic Czechoslovakia as a lawyer and diplomat, campaigning abroad for international recognition of the young republic. In the 1930s he mustered diplomatic support for opposition to the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and during World War II he served as ambassador to Great Britain for the Czechoslovakian government in exile. In 1945 he and his family regained the property that had been confiscated by the Nazis, only to see it seized again in 1948 by the Communist government. At the same time, Maximilian and his family were forced into exile.
Georg Christian of Lobkowicz (1907–1932), a racing driver who died after a crash at the 1932 Avusrennen, a motor race held at the AVUS circuit.
Princess Edward Joseph de Lobkowicz (1903–1976) was an American golfer and real estate broker who married Prince Edward Joseph de Lobkowicz.
Edouard de Lobkowicz (1926–2010) was an investment banker, an ambassador of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and the husband of Princess Marie-Françoise of Bourbon-Parma.
Bedřich (Frederick) Lobkowicz (1932–1998), physicist at University of Rochester.[4]
Stéphane de Lobkowicz, his wife Barbara d'Ursel de Lobkowicz and their daughter Ariane de Lobkowicz-d'Ursel have served in the Brussels Parliament.

The Lomond Hills (meaning either beacon hills or bare hills),[2] also known outside the locality as the Paps of Fife,[3][2] are a range of hills in central Scotland. They lie in western central Fife and Perth and Kinross, Scotland. At 522 metres (1,713 ft) West Lomond is the highest point in the county of Fife.


Etymology[edit]
The name Lomond Hills was first recorded Lomondys in 1315,[2]  and may derive from a Pictish cognate of Welsh llumon, meaning "beacon",[2]  an element found for example in the hill-name Pumlumon in Wales.[2] Also suggested is derivation from Gaelic lom monadh, "bare hill",[2]  perhaps adapted from an earlier Pictish name containing cognate elements.[2]

Physical geography[edit]
Summit Cone, West Lomond
The Lomond Hills contain two prominent peaks, West Lomond and East Lomond (or Falkland Hill)[4] (448 metres (1,470 ft)), which sit just under 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) apart above a long north and west-facing escarpment over 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) in length. The escarpment, made from beds of sandstone, limestone and a quartz-dolerite sill, rises steeply from the low ground to the north and west to a plateau of around 350 metres (1,150 ft) in height between the peaks of East and West Lomond. The western portion of the escarpment runs southwards from West Lomond beyond the deep valley of the Glen Burn (Glen Vale) to Bishop Hill (locally, simply The Bishop)[5] (461 metres (1,512 ft)). The steep-sided peaks of East and West Lomond themselves are volcanic in origin. Along the edges of the sandstone bed at the foot of the scarp slopes are several strikingly eroded outcrops, the most famous of which are the Bunnet Stane and John Knox's Pulpit,[6] so named because it is believed to be a spot where covenanters held conventicles in the 17th century. There are also striking outcrops in the columnar jointing at the edge of the dolerite sill on Bishop Hill, most notably Carlin Maggie.
The River Eden, one of the two primary rivers in Fife, has its source on the slopes of West Lomond. On the northern slopes of the Lomond Hills, two burns run down from the plateau in impressive gorges. These are the Maspie Burn and the Arraty Burn. Maspie Den has a path running along its length to an undercut waterfall at the top, which can be accessed just beyond Falkland House (approaching from the Falkland direction). Glen Vale with the Glen Burn, to the south of West Lomond, is equally impressive.

Geology[edit]
The hills are formed from early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks overlying Devonian sandstones and intruded by sills and volcanic plugs during late Carboniferous and Permian times. The lower ground to the north and west is formed from late Devonian rocks of the Glenvale Sandstone Formation traditionally ascribed to the Old Red Sandstone. Overlying this and forming the lower slopes of the scarp are the early Carboniferous sandstones of the Knox Pulpit and the Kinnesswood formations. Next in succession are the Pathhead Formation rocks which include cycles of sandstones, siltstones, mudstones, ironstones and limestone, formerly referred to as the Calciferous Sandstone Measures. These in turn are overlain by the varied cyclic sequences of the Lower Limestone Formation.
The igneous rocks are relatively resistant to erosion and form the main scarp and two summits. A quartz-dolerite sill of probable Permo-Carboniferous age, forming a part of the Midland Valley Sill Complex intrudes the early Carboniferous sedimentary rocks of the Lower Limestone Formation. The peaks of West Lomond and Green Hill are nepheline-basanite intrusions whilst East Lomond is a teschenite/olivine dolerite intrusion and vent agglomerate.  A few faults affect the escarpment vertically offsetting the crags on either side. The Coul Fault is a northerly downthrowing fault aligned WNW-ESE running through the range and beneath Ballo Reservoir.
Many lower areas are draped with glacial till from the last ice age. Easterly directed meltwater channels occur around the northeastern and southern margins.[7][8][9]

History[edit]
The remains of Iron Age hill forts can be found around the summits of both East and West Lomond as well as at Maiden Castle, a grassy knoll that lies between the two.
In more recent history, the Lomond Hills were mined for limestone, ore and lead, although there are no longer any working quarries there today. On the southwest slopes of East Lomond are the well preserved remains of a limekiln and quarry.
Beneath the northern slopes of the escarpment lies Falkland Estate, an area of forest (now commercial plantation), where the kings of Scotland would have hunted whilst staying at nearby Falkland Palace. The present custodian of the palace is Ninian Crichton-Stuart, brother of the Marquess of Bute.

Recreation and land management[edit]
Due to the steep gradients and poor soil, the primary land uses on the Lomond Hills are sheep grazing and commercial forestry (predominantly on the steep north slopes) and water catchment. There are six reservoirs in the Lomond Hills that were originally constructed to supply water to the rapidly growing mining towns of west Fife.
The Lomond Hills lie within the boundaries of Fife Regional Park, renamed the Lomond Hills Regional Park in 2003, and have their own ranger service who work principally with the landowners, estate managers and farmers on issues such as public access to help minimise the impact of recreational activities on their day-to-day business. The park covers approximately 65 square kilometres (25 sq mi) and is divided as follows: 1,120 hectares (2,800 acres) of land is in public ownership: 500 hectares (1,200 acres) belong to Fife Council and 620 are owned by Scottish Water. The balance of 5,355 hectares (13,230 acres) is privately owned.
As a result of their accessibility and proximity to several major population centres, the hills are very popular with walkers. This has resulted in a considerable amount of footpath erosion, particularly on the steeper sections, that the ranger service and volunteer workers are taking measures to counteract. Both East and West Lomond can easily be climbed from Craigmead Car Park, which lies between the two at a height of around 300 metres (980 ft). Alternative routes exist from the Bunnet Stane, the village of Falkland and the car park at the masts, high on East Lomond. The views from both summits, due to their prominence, are magnificent, stretching from the Highlands to the Borders, with the sea in the east.
As well as walking, there are a number of other recreational activities that take place in the Lomonds. East Lomond, due to the easy access from the high car park, is often used by paragliders on windy days. The Falkland Hill Race is held annually and begins at the fountain in the centre of Falkland village. The competitors must run (or in many cases walk) to the summit of East Lomond before returning to the fountain. The wooded northern slopes of East Lomond also boast a series of downhill mountainbike tracks.
Gliders from the Scottish Gliding Centre at Portmoak between Bishop Hill and Loch Leven may be seen riding the thermals above the hills.

Osama Orabi (Arabic: أسامة عرابي; born 25 January 1962) is an Egyptian retired professional footballer who played as a midfielder.


Playing career[edit]
Early career[edit]
As a 13-year-old boy, Orabi attempted to join Al Ahly in 1975, but did not succeed. He unsuccessfully tried out once again at Al-Ahly in 1978. In 1981, he trained for two weeks with the first team of Arab Contractors but failed to impress the technical staff to sign him.
Encouraged by a friend named Abdul Moneim Muhammad Ali, Orabi was introduced to Ahmed Maher, Al-Ahly U-21 Manager. Maher decided to attach Orabi to the team in 1982.

Al-Ahly[edit]
Orabi first appearance with Al-Ahly's first team was in 1982–83 season against Olympic Alexandria, when Mahmoud El-Gohary was Al-Ahly manager and Abdel-Aziz Abdel Shafi was the Football Director. Orabi was introduced as a substitute for Mokhtar Mokhtar in the last 20 minutes of the match that was played in Alexandria. Al-Ahly won 6–0 as Zakaria Nasef scored 3 goals,  Fawzi Scotty 2 goals, and Mokhtar Mokhtar 1 goal.
Orabi's professional football career began in the 1983–84 season and ended in the 1998–99 season. During this 16 seasons span, Orabi won 28 different championship titles with Al-Ahly. He achieved an unprecedented record for any player by winning the football league 10 times during his career.

National team[edit]
Orabi participated in the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy and played one of Egypt's three matches in the competition. He played the full match against Ireland, which ended in a 0–0 draw. The match was moderated by Belgian referee Marcel van Langenhove and took place in June 1990 in the city of Palermo.[1]

Coaching career[edit]
After his retirement, Osama Orabi became the trainer of Al-Ahly's first team during the 2001–02 Egyptian Premier League season. Al-Ahly's technical staff at the time included the Portuguese manager Manuel Jose, the General coach Mokhtar Mokhtar, and the coach Hossam El-Badry in addition to Orabi. Al-Ahly won the National League Champions Cup and the African Super Cup under this technical staff management.
Osama Orabi raised to the first man position as he became the manager of Al-Sekka Al-Hadid and later Gasco in the Egyptian Second Division. On 6 June 2010, El-Entag El-Harby (a.k.a. Military  Production) reached an agreement with Orabi to become the team manager with a one-season contract.[2] Orabi will be leading El-Entag El-Harby in its second season in the Egyptian Premier League in its history.

The Berenguela Tower (Spanish: Torre de la Berenguela or Torre de la Trinidad, lit. 'Tower of the Trinity'), is the bell tower of the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Tradition states that it was built by Archbishop Rodrigo del Padrón as a defense tower with the work continuing after his death by his successor, Archbishop Bérenger de Landore, after whom the tower is named. Reflecting its original purpose, much of the tower is made of ashlar stone. The tower sits on the southeast side of the cathedral where the Pratarias Square  [Wikidata] and Quintana Square meet. The tower is visible throughout the city.


Background[edit]
The upper portion of the 75 metres (246 ft) tower has a pyramid-shaped crown, surrounded by four permanently lit bulbs and topped with a lantern finial.[1] Construction of the tower began circa 1316 at the direction of Archbishop Rodrigo del Padrón as a defense tower. After Padrón's death the work was continued by his successor, Bérenger de Landore. The tower is named after de Landore. In the 15th century several modifications were made and in 1483 Louis XI of France donated the two largest of the thirteen bells.[2]
In 1833, Archbishop Rafael de Vélez [es] commissioned Andrés Antelo to install clocks on each side of the tower. The clock mechanism has two bells, one, sounding the full hour, called Berenguela, and a smaller one marking the quarter hours. The bells were cast in 1729 by Güemes Sampedro. Berenguela has a diameter of 255 cm (100 in) and a height of 215 cm (85 in), weighing approximately 9,600 kg (21,200 lb), while the smaller one weighs in  at 1,839 kg (4,054 lb), with a diameter of 147 cm (58 in) and a height of 150 cm (59 in). Both original bells cracked and were replaced by replicas, cast in Asten, Netherlands by the Eijsbouts foundry in 1989, and installed in the cathedral in February 1990.[3][4]
During a Jacobean Holy Year, Berenguela's lantern is lit throughout the year. otherwise it stays unlit. The light acts as a lighthouse to guide pilgrims to the cathedral during the holy years.[5]

Sir Peter Richard Caruana, KCMG KC (born 15 October 1956) is a Gibraltarian former politician who served as Chief Minister of Gibraltar from 1996 to 2011 and Leader of the Gibraltar Social Democrats (GSD) from 1991 to 2013. He is the longest serving Chief Minister to date.
Caruana is a barrister by profession. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel for Gibraltar in 1998 (which became King's Counsel upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II), and elected an Overseas Master of the Bench of Inner Temple in 2011.[1]


Early and personal life[edit]
Caruana was born in Gibraltar and is of Maltese and Italian descent. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School in Gibraltar, and then Grace Dieu Manor School and the independent Ratcliffe College (both in Leicestershire, England), and finally Queen Mary College, University of London and the Council of Legal Education. Before serving as Chief Minister, he was a partner in the law firm Triay & Triay. He is married to Cristina, daughter of Joseph Triay, a local barrister.[2] He has 7 children: Michael, Georgina, Nicola, Philippa, Patrick, Timothy, and James. His leisure interests are golf, and political and current affairs.

Politics[edit]
Prior to being elected to Government his political career progressed steadily. In 1990, Caruana became a member of the Gibraltar Social Democrats. One year later, he became leader of the party and in May 1991 gained a seat in the House of Assembly by winning Gibraltar's first contested by-election. In January 1992, Caruana led his party to the position of official opposition by winning seven seats in the House of Assembly. Finally, in May 1996, he led the party to victory and became Chief Minister of Gibraltar.
The GSD which he led from 1991 to 2012, is robustly against any transfer of sovereignty to Spain, but remains in favour of safe dialogue.[3] As Chief Minister, Caruana consistently refused to attend bi-lateral talks between the United Kingdom and Spain as part of the UK delegation, on the basis that the interests of the Gibraltarians were not protected, and he did not want to give any measure of legitimacy to talks over which Gibraltar had no control.
In 2002, he called a referendum on the subject of the proposed joint sovereignty deal, which led to it being abandoned.
In December 2004, the principle of tripartite talks, with the Government of Gibraltar as an equal party with the UK and Spain, was finally recognised, largely as a result of his involvement. This resulted in the Cordoba Agreement which improved communications between Gibraltar and Spain with direct flights from Madrid which subsequently collapsed due to a lack of demand, and in Spain finally recognising Gibraltar's international dialling code, thereby ending a long-standing dispute.
In November 2007, he was returned to office for a fourth term. Under his leadership, the Gibraltar Social Democrats were narrowly beaten in the general election of December 2011 by their rival party, the coalition between the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party and the Liberal Party of Gibraltar, who won said election by 1.2%. On 9 January 2013, Caruana made it public that he would stand down from the party leadership and as Leader of the Opposition at the end of the month.[4]

Awards[edit]
Caruana was appointed a Queen's Counsel for Gibraltar in 1998.[1] In 2003, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of Merit of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George by Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro.[5] Caruana was also appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to Gibraltar.[6][7]

2020 CW is a tiny near-Earth asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 1 meter (3 ft) in diameter. It was first observed by the Mount Lemmon Survey on 1 February 2020,[1] when it passed Earth very closely at a nominal distance of only 0.041 lunar distances (0.000105 astronomical units).[2] The object's orbital elements remain highly uncertain.[1][2]

Description[edit]
2020 CW passed within 15,660 kilometres (9,730 mi) of the Earth on 1 February 2020, with a fly-by speed of 21.2 kilometres (13.2 mi) per second.[2] The household-appliance-sized asteroid passed within the orbit of satellites in the geostationary ring at 35,900 kilometres (22,300 mi) above Earth's equator.[5] At the time, it was the closest approach in the year 2020. Since then, 2020 JJ made a closer approach on 4 May 2020.[6]
The asteroid was first observed 1 February 2020 by the Mount Lemmon Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory in the Santa Catalina Mountains northeast of Tucson, Arizona.[1] The next encounter closer than the Moon is predicted to occur 5 February 2029 at a distance of 19,040 kilometres (11,830 mi) or more.[2]

Rainbow is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Kesha. It was released on August 11, 2017, by Kemosabe and RCA Records. Primarily a pop record, Rainbow incorporates elements of pop rock, glam rock, neo soul, and country pop. Its lyrical themes range from letting go of the past, finding forgiveness within oneself for past mistakes, self-worth, and female empowerment.[2] Kesha assumed an integral role in the album's production and collaborated with several producers, including Ricky Reed, Drew Pearson, Ben Folds, and her mother Pebe Sebert.
Following the release of her second studio album, Warrior (2012), Kesha dealt with several struggles in her personal and professional life, including a stint in a treatment center for an eating disorder and emotional issues, as well as a highly publicized legal battle with her former record producer Dr. Luke, whom she accused of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Kesha began writing material for her next album while in rehab in 2014 and as her recording contract at the time obliged her to work with Dr. Luke, she later recorded a series of new songs on her own and gave them to her record label. In 2016, it was confirmed that work had officially commenced on Kesha's third studio album, with Sony Music Entertainment assuring Kesha she would be able to produce a new album without having to work with Dr. Luke, the founder of Kemosabe Records. "Praying" was released as the lead single from Rainbow in July 2017, going on to be certified platinum in several countries worldwide. "Woman" was released as the second single from the album thereafter, seeing moderate commercial success worldwide.[3]
Rainbow marks a noticeable departure from the electropop sound of Kesha's first two studio albums. She co-wrote all but one track on the album, and said that she wanted her new music to reflect that she is a "real person having a complete human experience," stating that there was no balance in her previous work.[4] Kesha stated that the album was inspired by several of her musical influences, including Iggy Pop, T. Rex, Dolly Parton, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, James Brown, and Sweet. The album also features collaborations and guest appearances by Parton, Eagles of Death Metal, and the Dap-Kings Horns.
Rainbow debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States with 117,000 album-equivalent units and was the subject of "universal acclaim" from music critics, with several complimenting the feminist angle and uniqueness of the record as well as Kesha's vocal performance and ability to interweave different genres of music on the album. The album has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, marking Kesha's first Grammy nomination. Kesha promoted the album through television and music festival performances and embarked on both the Rainbow Tour (2017–2019) and the Adventures of Kesha and Macklemore (2018), with American rapper Macklemore.


Background and recording[edit]
Kesha stated that Rainbow "quite literally" saved her life.
Kesha initially began writing songs for her third studio album while as a patient at Timberline Knolls, an Illinois treatment center, for an eating disorder in 2014. Eager to write music while in treatment, a friend brought her a toy keyboard, and after some negotiation, the staff let her keep it.[4] She was not permitted to use any instrument with a power cord, explaining in an interview with Rolling Stone that the staff did not want her to have any objects that could be used for suicide: "And I was like, 'I respect all of that, but please let me have a keyboard or my brain's going to explode. My head has all these song ideas in it, and I just really need to play an instrument.'"[5] She completed work on several songs while in treatment, and following her release from rehab, she removed the dollar sign from her name, explaining it as a way of taking back her power.[4] In her August 2014 Teen Vogue cover interview, Kesha revealed she had recorded 14 new songs while in rehab.[6] Thereafter, Kesha filed an ongoing lawsuit against her former producer, Dr. Luke, accusing him of sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Since her recording contract at the time obliged her to work with the man she accused of abuse, Kesha subsequently became unable to release any new music under her label unless she worked with Dr. Luke, to which she refused.[7][8] As a result, Kesha recorded 22 new songs on her own during the legal battle and later gave them to her label.[9][10] After Sony Music Entertainment assured the singer she would be able to produce a new album without Dr. Luke, the founder of her label, work on Kesha's third studio album officially commenced.[11][12] In the summer of 2016, Kesha embarked on her third world tour, the Kesha and the Creepies: Fuck the World Tour. The tour commenced on July 23, 2016, in Las Vegas and ended on October 29, 2016, in Maine. The tour included various covers of songs and several rock and country reworks of her own hit singles.[13][14]
In a New York Magazine profile in October 2016, Kesha stated that as much as her first two studio albums Animal (2010) and Warrior (2012) represented who she was, she felt there was "no balance", saying that she is "a real person having a complete human experience" and she wanted her future music to represent that: "To this day, I've never released a single that's a true ballad, and I feel like those are the songs that balance out the perception of you, because you can be a fun girl. You can go and have a crazy night out, but you also, as a human being, have vulnerable emotions. You have love."[4] In an interview with Good Morning America the week of Rainbow's release, Kesha stated that she had written every song on the album and described Rainbow as "quite literally saving [her] life", and expressed her hope that the album would help people. She also explained the symbolism of the album's title, saying that she thinks "color symbolizes hope – and the rainbow, it's no coincidence that it's also the symbol for the LGBT community. I've always just found hope in the bright colors, and I wanted to bring that more into my everyday life. Now my house is covered in rainbows, and my life and my body – I have like 10 rainbow tattoos. I go to the tattoo artist and it's like, 'A rainbow something?'"[15]

Composition[edit]
Kesha has said that Rainbow was inspired by her "true" musical influences: Iggy Pop, T. Rex, Dolly Parton, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys, James Brown, and Sweet.[16] The album contains a combination of both mellow songs and upbeat songs such as "Bastards" and "Woman", respectively. The album opens with the country-infused cut "Bastards", which, as Katie Baillie of Metro analyzed, is "about not letting the bullies drag you down." "Woman" was inspired by a "pussy grabbing comment" Donald Trump made, which angered Kesha and made her yell "I'm a motherfucking woman!" This line is included throughout the song. Kesha wrote the title track on a toy keyboard while in rehab. It opens only with vocals and basic chords played on a piano.[2] The first line Kesha sings is, "Got back the stars in my eyes, I see the magic inside of me." Baillie writes that the track "builds in both sound and emotion [...] as a full live orchestra kicks in." Kesha was inspired to write "Learn to Let Go" by one of her friends who went through "the worst childhood imaginable." The track is also based on Kesha's struggles while making Rainbow.[2]

Artwork[edit]
The album cover and artwork was created by artist Robert Beatty. Kesha had requested for Beatty's help based on his artwork for Tame Impala and the Flaming Lips.[17] Beatty worked with photographer Olivia Bee and art director Brian Roettinger.[18] The cover itself features psychedelic imagery that is a trademark of Beatty's work.[18]

Promotion[edit]
Kesha performed in Japan at the Summer Sonic Festival on two dates: August 19 in Osaka and August 20, 2017, in Tokyo.[19] Following this, Kesha staged a solo concert in Nagoya on August 21.[20] In September, Kesha performed at the KAABOO and iHeartRadio festivals.[21] Kesha was also a performer at the MTV Europe Music Awards on November 12.[22] Kesha, alongside many other popular female singers, performed "Praying" at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018.
Kesha embarked on the Rainbow Tour, which began in Birmingham on September 26, 2017. She also went on a co-headlining tour with American rapper Macklemore named the Adventures of Kesha and Macklemore (2018). The tour took place in 30 cities in North America during the summer of 2018.

Singles[edit]
The album's lead single, "Praying" was released on July 6, 2017, with the album's pre-order. The track was announced a day prior to the song's release and was co-written by Ryan Lewis. The song deals with Kesha's past suicidal thoughts and is suggested by reviewers that it is about Dr. Luke, although he is not named in the song. The song impacted US radio on July 18, 2017.[23]
"Woman" was released as the album's first promotional single on July 13, 2017. The song was released as the second and final single from the album, when it officially impacted US adult contemporary radio on January 22, 2018, and contemporary hit radio on January 23, 2018.[3]
"Learn to Let Go" was released as the album's second promotional single on July 28, 2017. "Hymn" was released as the album's third promotional single on August 3, 2017, and was the only song out of the previous three releases to not have an accompanying music video out at that time. The official music video for the song was released months later on May 31, 2018. The song went on to chart in Scotland and New Zealand (on the Heatseekers Chart), at 88 and 6, respectively.[24][25]

Rainbow received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 81 out of 100, which indicates "universal acclaim" based on 27 reviews.[27] Katie Baillie of Metro, who reviewed Rainbow a month before its release, called it a "powerful, emotional and strongly feminist record that is worth the four-year wait." She wrote that the "vulnerability of some songs will bring a tear to your eye, while others are so close to Kesha's old sound it'll have dance floors filled everywhere in no time." She described the album as "a roller coaster of emotions, making you weep at the sadness of 'Rainbow' and fist-pumping the air with 'Woman', and it was so worth the wait."[2]
Andrew Uterberger of Billboard complimented Kesha's ability to make every song on the album sound different as well as differentiate herself from the electropop sound of her first two albums, stating that "it all works" and writing: "Kesha has the swagger for neo-glam, the grit for old-school soul, the pipes for power-balladry – listening to some of the spine-shivering feats she accomplishes on 'Praying', it's practically unthinkable that she was mostly consigned to sing-speaking her way through the majority of her musical career. And she's not even half done: Before the end of Rainbow, the singer formerly known as K-Money will have sauntered her way through train-chugging, Johnny Cash-via-Kacey Musgraves country ('Hunt You Down'), schlocky frat rock ('Boogie Feet') and quirky singer-songwriter parables ('Godzilla'). And the only arguable stumble in the bunch comes with the stomping 'Boots', which pairs the taunting wordplay of Kesha 1.0 ("If you can't handle these claws/ You don't get this kitty) with an electro-folk stomp that feels like a lukewarm version of Miley Cyrus' Bangerz."[38]

Kesha's cover of Dolly Parton's "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You", featuring guest vocals from Parton herself (pictured), was hailed by one critic as Rainbow's most powerful moment.
Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone gave Rainbow four stars out of a possible five and wrote: "On her excellent comeback record, Rainbow, Kesha channels that drama into the best music of her career – finding common ground between the honky-tonks she loves (her mom is Nashville songwriter Pebe Sebert) and the dance clubs she ruled with hits like 'Tik Tok' and 'Die Young', between glossy beats, epic ballads and grimy guitar riffs. In the process, she also finds her own voice: a freshly empowered, fearlessly feminist Top 40 rebel." Spanos also noted the noticeable departure from the electropop sound of Kesha's first two albums, writing, "Kesha used to sing about partying with rich dudes and feeling like P. Diddy. Rainbow is full of sympathetic (if at times cloying) prisoner metaphors and therapist clichés [...] Across the board, she achieves a careful balance of her diverse musical selves: The gospel-tinged 'Praying' takes the high road by wishing the best to the people who have hurt her, and 'Woman' is a blissfully irreverent, proudly self-sufficient retro-soul shouter backed by Brooklyn funk crew the Dap-Kings."[39] She also stated that the album's "most powerful moment" is the singer's cover of Dolly Parton's "Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You", saying, "Parton herself helps out on guest vocals. But this isn't some Grand Ole Opry homage. Kesha flips and filters it through her dreamy vision, turning the sweet tune into rousing rockabilly until the standard sounds refreshed and vividly modern, battle-tested and born again. Just like the woman singing it."[39]
Katherine Flynn of Consequence of Sound complimented Kesha's ability to retain her uniqueness on the record and stated that the album "feels much more organic" than her previous work, writing: "Rainbow, as a comprehensive work, feels much more organic and of this earth than anything by dollar-sign Ke$ha. There's a strong, organic rock and country influence that places her much more firmly in a lineage, a tradition, instead of the weird, airless, EDM-influenced vacuum that she inhabited on songs like the title track of 2012's Warrior and hits like 'Blow'."[40] In an equally favorable review, Hilary Weaver of Vanity Fair described Rainbow as "a blatant, angry response to the singer's battle with a legal system that has left her feeling frustrated and trapped as an artist—but also a powerful pop album that earns the anticipation", writing: "This is an unapologetically open and honest Kesha we have never heard before—her voice is still recognizable but not as poppy and more focused with a message she wants her audience to hear loud and clear. She seems to come closest to directly referencing Dr. Luke once, as 'the boogeyman under [her] bed' in 'Letting Go'; the album is a more general, vocal proclamation against anyone who has wronged her in the past. This is Kesha's story, but it’s also the response that any woman in the Trump era of 'locker-room talk' might want to blast in her car on a particularly frustrating day." She also described Kesha as being in a "far different place than when her last album was released", calling her a "symbol of women standing up against patriarchal forces keeping them down" and writing: "It lends an automatic weight to Rainbow that Ke$ha might not have been able to shoulder—but Kesha, at least as she appears on this album, is up to the challenge."[1]
In a more mixed review, Chris Willman of Variety stated that Kesha seems "stuck between a rock and a hard place" on Rainbow, writing: "For a while, anyway, it seems that a better title for this album than Rainbow would have been Warrior (except she used that one on her previous record). It would be nice to report that the songs addressing the distress of the last few years reveal her as a great confessional singer/songwriter, but the clunkiness of her most sober material here blunts its impact. Her most angry/inspirational tracks, like 'Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down', 'Learn to Let Go', and 'Praying', suffer not from seriousness but relative artlessness as Kesha unleashes a stream of Deepak-ian self-help bromides (embellished with plenty of Tupac-ian language) that’d sound better as bathroom-mirror sticky-note affirmations than they do as gospel-choir-backed lyrics." He also negatively compared Kesha to Pink and the Dixie Chicks on the album, writing: "The moment for some kind of personal revelation is nigh, but all these pop-psych clichés leave you feeling you know less about the real Kesha than you did coming in."[41] Willman also lamented that the moments where Kesha expresses glimpses of her previous electropop "ridiculousness" on the album "[feel] refreshing and, just maybe, even more authentic. Not that you'd want her to push past her pain prematurely, but when it comes to the writing part, Kesha just happens to still be cleverer at playing koo-koo than guru."[41]

Gross-Basenach or Groß-Basenach is the designation for a series of five so-called M-class German military semi-rigid airships constructed by balloonist Nikolaus Basenach and Major Hans Georg Friedrich Groß (1860–1924) of the Royal Prussian Airship Battalion Nr 2[1] between 1907 and 1914.
They produced one experimental and four military Groß-Basenach types, rebuilding each one several times. In all they were not as successful as Major Groß wished. He was one of the sharpest critics of the Zeppelin airships, but the overall superiority and popularity of the Zeppelins doomed his own airships. Even his more successful competitors, Parseval and  Schütte-Lanz, could not compete with Zeppelin after the war's end.


Versuchsluftschiff[edit]
The Versuchluftschiff (experimental airship) had a volume of 1,800 cubic metres and had a keel directly under the balloon envelope. It was mostly constructed by the firm Siemens-Schuckert GmbH.[2]
The first flight took place at 1907-05-07.[2] The power plant was a 24-25 horsepower (HP)[2] Gaggenau automobile engine and allowed a top speed of 29 kilometres per hour (18 mph).
Later the airship was rebuilt, including among other things the empennage.

M I[edit]
Groß-Basenach M I
5,000 m³ volume
Length 65.5 metres, Diameter 11.1 metre
built by the Luftschiffer-Bataillon in Berlin Tegel
First flight: 30 June 1908
Propulsion: two Körting-engines each 75 HP
On 21 September 1908 it set a flight endurance record of over 13 hours. In 1913 the hull was lengthened to 71.8 metres. In its lengthened state it first flew on 26 March 1913. The keel was changed three times and the volume increased to 5600 m³. Nevertheless, the maximum speed remained unchanged at 47 kilometres per hour (29 mph).

M II[edit]
M II was built in 1909 and enlarged in 1911.

M III[edit]
Engine Körting 8 SL 116
M III was built in 1909 and first flew on 31 December 1909

Volume: 7,800 m³
Länge: 81.5 metres
enlarged in 1912 to 9,000 m³ and a length of 83.3 metre
Propulsion: two Körting-engines each 75 HP
Maximum speed: 59 kilometres per hour (37 mph); after rebuild: 68 kilometres per hour (42 mph)
M III was the fastest airship of its time.

M IV[edit]
19,000 cubic metres volume
fitted with a ballonet to regulate the pressure
1913 Rebuilt and equipped with 100-kilogram bombs
1914 enlarged
Propulsion: three Maybach-engines with a total of 480 horsepower (360 kW)
M IV achieved a top speed of 82 kilometres per hour (51 mph). From 28 December 1914 until 3 November 1915 it performed 24 patrols over the Baltic Sea. On 10 September 1915 it attacked a submarine with 100-kilogram bombs.[citation needed]

Jamia Ashrafia (جامعہ اشرفیہ, Ashrafia Islamic University), Lahore, Pakistan, is a religious educational institution founded by Mufti Muhammad Hassan in 1947.[3] The university has produced numerous scholars of Islam, serving various sectors of life.


History[edit]
The school was founded on 14 September 1947, just a month after the Partition of India which created Pakistan. Muhammad Hasan Amritsari named the university for Deobandi scholar Ashraf Ali Thanwi, in recognition of his support for the creation of an independent homeland for British India's Muslims.
It was founded in a quadrangular three-storied building in Nila Gumbad Anarkali at the centre of the thickly populated area of Lahore. 120 kanals of land between Canal Road and Ferozepur Road were purchased on 28 March 1955, and construction of a new school building began with the laying of the foundation stone of a mosque. In 1957 the majority of staff and students shifted to the new campus, and teaching of hadith courses began under the famous scholar Muhammad Idris Kandhlawi in 1958.
Today the main campus comprises a mosque, a large administrative and teaching block, two boarding houses (one for local students and one for foreign), a hospital, and residences for faculty and employees.

Leadership[edit]
Mufti Muhammad Hassan died on 1 June 1961. His sons, Mufti Muhammad Ubaidullah (late), Maulana Abd-ur-Rahman Ashrafi (late), Maulana Fazl-ur-Raheem, and Mufti Hasan's grandson Maulana Hafiz Arshad Ubaid manage the university matters.

The Burgthann–Allersberg railway was a ca. 15 kilometre long Lokalbahn or branch line in Bavaria, southern Germany, that began at Burgthann on the Nuremberg–Regensburg main line.


History[edit]
Planning and Construction[edit]
Plans to link Allersberg to the railway network at the end of the 19th century variously envisaged routes from Nuremberg, Ochenbruck or Roth, but in the end the Royal Bavarian State Railways built a branch from the Nuremberg–Regensburg railway at Burgthann. The route was finally opened on 15 December 1902.

Closure[edit]
The Deutsche Bundesbahn decided to close the route as early as the 1970s. The dilapidated state of the bridge over the B 8 accelerated this process, so that on 2 June 1973 the last train on the Allersberger Bockl left the station of Allersberg.

The trackbed today[edit]
After the line was dismantled, large sections of the trackbed were converted into a footpath and cycle way. The former station buildings at Pyrbaum and Allersberg are now homes. At another location, 33 years later, on 6 December 2006, the new Allersberg (Rothsee) station on the Nuremberg–Ingolstadt high-speed railway was opened.

Dontrell Smith (born January 16, 2003), known professionally as Kidd Kenn, is an American rapper and singer from Chicago, Illinois.[5][6] He rose to prominence with his singles "No Brakes" and "Moves" (featuring Rico Nasty).[7]


Early life[edit]
Dontrell Smith[8] was born on January 16, 2003, in the Chatham neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois.[9] He dropped out from high school while he was in the freshman year.[10] During the COVID-19 pandemic, he moved to Los Angeles with great responsibilities, paying bills and doing everything on his own.[11][12] The situation led to him making song covers, which provoked him to take  his rap career seriously.[13]

Musical career[edit]
"Eriod" was Kidd Kenn's first released track and served as his debut commercial single, which was also accompanied by a music video.[14] He considered rapping as "a full-time career" after the release of his hit single, "No Brakes", which received millions of streams on various platforms.[15] On August 11, 2018, Kenn released his debut mixtape, Childish, which added a guest verse from Katie Got Bandz. As of February 9, 2024, the mixtape rated as number 43 on the Album of The Year.[16]
A year later, Smith's career began to take off with his hit singles, which led him to his signing to Island Records.[17] After signing a recording deal, he went on to release his second mixtape Child's Play in 2020.[18] In September 2020, he released "Freestyle", featuring guest artist Delli Boe, which was accompanied by a music video.[19] On June 11, 2021, he released his debut extended play Problem Child.[20] Since then, he has collaborated with Rico Nasty on the song "Moves".[21] On 5 October 2021, Kidd Kenn made history by appearing as the first gay male rapper in the BET Hip Hop Awards Rap Cypher, he performed alongside Toosii, Lakeyah, Symba and DJ Hed.[22] On 20 May 2022, he released the song "Body", as a promotional single for his EP Celebrating Pride. The song became the lead single on the EP.[23] On June 17, 2022, Kenn released his single "At It Again", a collaboration with Belize singer Delli Boe,[24] which was accompanied by a music video.[25]
On June 29, 2022, Kidd Kenn released a single titled "Want Not A Need" featuring Baby Tate.[26] He also released an Ep that same year titled Celebrating Pride. After the release, he went on to release another extended play titled Grown in July 2022.[27] In August 2022, Kidd Kenn released a cover version of Old Town Road by Lil Nas X, the performance lends a glamorous, feminine touch to the song.[28] In December 2022, "Grown" was ranked at number 16 on The Triibe's 25 best Chicago hip hop and R&B albums of 2022.[29] He released his fifth EP "Busy Being Bad" on 20 October 2023.[30]

Standard of the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough at the Archbishop's throne in Christ Church Cathedral
The United Dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough is a diocese of the Church of Ireland in the east of Ireland. It is headed by the Archbishop of Dublin, who is also styled the Primate of Ireland. The diocesan cathedral is Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.


Overview and history[edit]
Diocese Highlighted
Early Christianity in Ireland[edit]
The broad Dublin area was Christian long before Dublin had a distinct diocese, with monasteries such as Glendalough as well as at Finglas, Glasnevin, Rathmichael, Swords, Tallaght. Several of these functioned as "head churches" and the most powerful of all was Glendalough.
In the early church in Ireland, the church had a monastic basis, with greatest power vested in the Abbots of the major communities. There were bishops but not organised dioceses in the modern sense, and the offices of abbot and bishop were often comprised in one person. Some early "Bishops of Dublin", back to 633, are mentioned in Ware's Antiquities of Ireland but the Diocese of Dublin is not considered to have begun until 1038, and when Ireland began to see organised dioceses, all of the current Diocese of Dublin, and more, was comprised in the Diocese of Glendalough.

The Norse Diocese of Dublin[edit]
Following a reverted conversion by one Norse King of Dublin, Sitric, his son Godfrey became Christian in 943, and the Kingdom of Dublin first sought to have a bishop of its own in the 11th century, under Sitric MacAulaf, who had been on pilgrimage to Rome.  He sent his chosen candidate, Donat (or Donagh or Donatus),  to be consecrated in Canterbury in 1038, and the new prelate set up the Diocese of Dublin as a small territory within the walled city, over which he presided until 1074. The new diocese was not part of the Church in Ireland but of the Norse Province of Canterbury. Sitric also provided for the building of Christ Church Cathedral in 1038 "with the lands of Baldoyle, Raheny and Portrane for its maintenance."[1]
At the Synod of Rathbreasail, convened in 1118 by Gillebert (Gilbert), Bishop of Limerick, on papal authority, the number of dioceses in Ireland was fixed at twenty-four. Dublin was not included, the city being described as lying in the Diocese of Glendalough, but the Norse Bishops continued, still attached to Canterbury.

The Reorganisation of the Church in Ireland, 1152[edit]
Then, in 1151, Pope Eugene III commissioned Cardinal Paparo to go to Ireland and establish four metropolitans, and at a general synod at Kells in 1152, Armagh, Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, were created archiepiscopal sees. In a document drawn up by the then Archbishop of Tuam in 1214, the cardinal is described as finding both a bishop based in Dublin, who at the time exercised his episcopal office within the city walls only, and "He found in the same Diocese another church in the mountains, which likewise had the name of a city (Glendalough) and had a certain chorepiscopus. But he delivered the pallium to Dublin which was the best city and appointed that the diocese (Glendalough) in which both these cities were should be divided, and that one part thereof should fall to the metropolitan."
The part of North County Dublin known as Fingall was taken from Glendalough Diocese and attached to Dublin City. The new Archdiocese had 40 parishes, in deaneries based on the old senior monasteries. All dependence upon English churches such as Canterbury was also ended.

The Early Archbishops[edit]
The founding Archbishop of the larger Dublin Diocese, consecrated at Lambeth, was Gregory, with the Bishops of Kildare, Ossory, Leighlin, Ferns, and Glendalough reporting to him.
The second Archbishop, from 1161 to 1179, was Saint Laurence O'Toole, previously Abbot of Glendalough, who had previously been elected as Bishop of Glendalough but had declined that office. During his time in office, the presence of the Church grew in Dublin city (by 1170 there were six churches other than the cathedral within the walls[2]) and religious orders from the continent came to Ireland (Augustinians, Dominicans, Franciscans and Carmelites had houses in Dublin, and the great convent of Grace Dieu, near Donabate, was an example of women's religious life and education). As part of this trend, Laurence installed a community of canons to minister according to the Aroasian Rule in the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, later known as Christchurch. The important house of Abbey of Saint Mary was founded in Dublin at that time, first under the Benedictine Rule, then passing to the Cistercians.
Not only was the Irish Church transformed in that 12th century by new organisation and new arrivals from abroad, but Ireland's political scene was changed permanently by the coming of the Normans and the influence of the English Crown.
Saint Laurence's successor was a Norman, and from then onward to the time of the Reformation in Ireland, Dublin's Archbishops were all either Norman or English.

Merger of Dublin and Glendalough[edit]
In 1185, the Lord of Ireland, John Lackland, granted the merger of the dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough. This was initially without effect as the charter lacked papal approval. When the bishop Macrobius died in 1192, a synod was held in Dublin under the direction of the papal legate Metthew O Enna. William Piro was elected as bishop of Glendalough and remained in office at least until 1212. Robert de Bedford was elected as successor in 1213 or 1214 but he had never the opportunity to take possession of the diocesan seat. Instead, John, now King of England, reissued a grant to join Glendalough to Dublin which was finally approved by Pope Innocent III in 1216 and confirmed by his successor Honorius III in the same year.[3][4]

Reformation[edit]
The English-speaking minority in Ireland post-Reformation mostly adhered to the Church of Ireland or to Presbyterianism; the dioceses became integrated into this new church independent from the Catholic Church. In 1833, the two provinces of Dublin and Cashel were merged. Over the centuries, numerous dioceses were merged, in view of declining membership.[citation needed]

The Mystery of the Disappearing Cat (1944) is the second in the Five Find-Outers series of children's mystery novels by Enid Blyton. It was published by Methuen and Co Ltd and follows the first book in the series, The Mystery of the Burnt Cottage. It tells of a stolen cat the group of children work to uncover.


Plot[edit]
Luke, a friend of the Five Find-Outers, is working in Lady Candling's garden when her valuable Siamese cat is stolen. The Five Find-Outers and Dog work to solve the case.

Characters[edit]
The Main Characters

Elizabeth "Bets" Hliton — The youngest of the Five Find-Outers and Dog
Philip "Pip" Hilton— A member of the Five Find-Outers and Dog and Bets's brother
Lawrence "Larry" Daykin— The chief of the Five Find-Outers and Dog
Margaret "Daisy" Daykin— A member of the Five Find-Outers and Dog and Larry's sister. She is also the founder of The Five Find-Outers and Dog.
Frederick Algernon "Fatty" Trotteville —The smartest of the five Find-Outers and Dog. He is also the leader of the group.
Buster — Fatty's Scottish Terrier dog
Mr Goon — the bumbling village Policeman who again fails to solve the case. Friend of Mr Tupping.
Suspects

Luke — Mr Tupping's assistant gardener of fifteen. Friend of the Five Find-Outers and Dog. Top suspect of stealing Lady Candling's best siamese cat, Dark Queen.
Lady Candling — The owner of the stolen valuable cat
Miss Harmer — The person who takes care of Lady Candling's cats
Miss Trimble — Lady Candling's companion, scared of the fierce Mr Tupping.
Mr. Tupping — The gardener of Lady Candling. Rude, bad tempered, fierce and cruel to Luke. Thinks he owns the garden.
Summary[edit]
It all takes place next door to Pip and Bets Hilton, when Lady Candling's prize cat, Dark Queen (a valuable siamese), disappears right under the nose of Luke, the gardener's help. Mr Tupping, (the gardener), is a nasty piece of work and the children immediately decide it would be great if he were the thief! But how could he be, if he wasn't even there when Dark Queen was stolen? All the evidence points to poor young Luke, Mr Tupping's helper, but the Find-Outers simply can't believe Luke is the thief.
There are a couple of other possible suspects in Lady Candling's staff, such as Miss Harmer the cat handler, and Miss Trimble, who takes care of the roses. They're all pretty sure it was Mr Tupping...but how on earth did he do it? The answer to the mystery is very simple and pretty clever. Mr Tupping stole Dark Queen in the morning, then painted a small patch of cream-colored paint to another cat's tail to disguise it as Dark Queen, whose tail was bitten by another cat, resulting in the creamy patch on its tail. Then he made Luke work beside the cage all day, so that he could be the top suspect of the case. In the afternoon, Mr Tupping hopped into the cage, rubbed the paint off the cat's tail with a rag soaked in turps, and then announced Dark Queen was gone! At last, Mr Tupping was caught and shown that he had been mixed up with dog thieving cases before.

The LongPen is a remote signing device conceived of by writer Margaret Atwood in 2004 and debuted in 2006.[1] It allows a person to write remotely in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the Internet and a robotic hand.[2] It also supports an audio and video conversation between the endpoints, such as a fan and author, while a book is being signed.
The system was used by Conrad Black, who was under arrest, to "attend" a book signing event without leaving his home.[2]

Taekwondo techniques vary between most schools and level and not all techniques are included.Techniques often combined into shorter set (Hyeong), but these vary from school to school.


Hand attacks[edit]
Taekwondo hand strikes are  as a close distance alternative to kicks. They are executed in a number of ways from standing, jumping, spinning and rushing forwards. Hand strikes make up fast combinations of strikes which can leave an opponent stunned and unable to defend himself. Taekwondo hand strikes can be separated into two distinct styles:

Closed hand strikes (jireugi)
Open hand techniques (chigi)
Various surfaces of the hand may be engaged as the striking surface depending on which area of the opponents body which is being targeted. This leads to a large array of hand positions.

Forefist - A closed fist may be jabbed out directly to strike with the forefist knuckles. This is a suitable position for general punches to soft areas of the body. Without protection, it is inadvisable to strike the bony face as fingers are likely to get broken on the hard temple and jaw bones.
Hammer fist - A closed fist may be brought down in a hammering motion to strike with the underneath. Such a strike can obliterate an opponent's nose, making it nearly impossible for him to retaliate.
Backfist - A Son Deung clenched hand is swung backwards into the face of an opponent. The back of the hand makes contact and the momentum garnered in the swing makes this a powerful strike. Spinning backfists are a knockout punch and banned in most Taekwondo competitions.
Flying Punch - struck usually from the rear hand, the combatant hops on the front foot, kicking back with the rear foot and simultaneously extending the rear hand as a punch, in the form of "superman" flying through the sky.
Knifehand - 'Sonkal' is the Taekwondo name for a move similar to the "karate chop", i.e. where an open hand is hammered down to make impact with the underside. A ridgehand is the opposite, where the top of the open hand strikes. These are commonly made to the side of the neck.
Fingertips - Jumeok can be used to strike vulnerable areas of the body such as pressure points. Four finger strikes engaging the tips of the outstretched hand (known as a spearhand) can be made to vital points in the neck.
Thumb - Eomji is a fist with the thumb protruding over the top. This is a formidable weapon in pressure point striking. Vulnerable areas can be targeted all over the body such as the sternum, the spaces in between the ribs and other nerve clusters.
Palm heel - a classic self-defense strike where the hand is pulled back to engage the base of the palm in an upwards thrusting strike. This is particularly dangerous if applied to the base of the nose or chin and can result in death. This strike is banned in competition Taekwondo.
Elbow strike (palgup chigi)- The forearm is folded inwards towards the body and the strike is delivered with the outside of the forearm or elbow while stepping forwards. Tae Kwon Do also makes use of reverse and front elbow strikes.
Four-knuckle strike - This is a fist shape particular to the Asian martial arts. Instead of closing the fist completely, the fingers are held out and only the knuckles are bent, thereby presenting the upper set of knuckles as the striking surface. This fist is used for breaking boards as the smaller surface area concentrates the punches power. In self-defense, it may be used to purposefully break an attacker's jaw.
Eagle strike - In this strike, the fingers all touch together, and the hand is pointed down, exposing the top of the wrist, which is then swung upward to strike the underside of the jaw. If done properly, this strike can easily fracture the jawbone, and is usually banned from competitions due to the extreme danger. If done improperly, however, the practitioner may break his wrist.
Tiger claw - A strike using the space between the index finger and thumb. Fingers are made rigid, and the attack is usually directed towards the neck/trachea. Serves as a way to incapacitate an opponent for a few seconds.
Pincer hand - A strike which uses thumb and forefinger to strike opponent's throat. In this technique a fist is closed except thumb and forefinger which are fully extended outwards.
Scissor finger - A fist in which forefinger and middle finger is extended out as if to dig someone's eye. Similar to Pincer hand except that the forefinger and middle finger is extended outwards.
Chestnut fist - Similar to normal fist except that first three knuckles are pushed outward slightly with thumb.
Kick (Chagi)[edit]
Main article: Kick
All kicks can be executed as jump kicks, spin kicks, jump spin kicks or multi-rotational spin kicks. Also, all can be performed by the front or rear leg in a given stance.
Some of the best-known Taekwondo kicks include:

Front Kick (앞 차기 ap chagi): This is a very linear kick. The practitioner raises the knee to the waist, pulls the toes back and quickly extends the foot at the target. It is also known as the snap kick. The front kick is one of the first kicks learned in taekwondo; if mastered it can become one of the most powerful. This technique is more meant to be used to push the attacker away, but can injure the opponent as well.
Side kick (옆 차기 yeop chagi): A very powerful kick, in which the practitioner simultaneously raises the knee and rotates the body 90 degrees, while extending their leg. In WTF style taekwondo, this technique should strike with the outside edge of the foot, although using the heel may provide more force if used in sparring.
Roundhouse kick (돌려 차기 dollyeo chagi): The practitioner raises the knee, turns the hips, pivots on the non-kicking foot, and snaps the kick horizontally into the target at an 80 to 90-degree angle, either with the instep or with the ball of the foot with the toes pulled back.
Back kick (뒷 차기 dwit chagi): The practitioner turns the body away from the target and pushes the back leg straight toward the target, hitting it with the heel while watching over the shoulder.  The turning motion helps to give this kick a lot of power. Without proper care, you can "spin out" and lose your balance from using this attack.
Reverse side kick (반대 옆 차기 bandae yeop chagi):  This kick is similar to the back kick, except the body turns further, allowing the heel to hit the target with the foot pointing to the side as in a regular side kick, instead of downward as in a true back kick.
Hook kick (후려 차기 huryeo chagi): A less popular kick traditionally, however it has found increasing favor in modern competitions. The practitioner raises the knee in a fashion similar to the roundhouse kick, then extends the foot outward then snaps it around in a dorsal arc, with the heel as the intended striking weapon.
Axe kick (내려 차기 naeryeo chagi): Another kick that has increased in popularity due to sparring competitions. The leg is raised usually from the outside of the body like an outside crescent kick. then the leg is pulled down with the heel pointed downward. It is typically targeted toward the head, shoulder, or chest and requires significant flexibility to employ effectively. This kick is best used against the collar bone, which can readily break from this attack. the setup in the initial raise of the kick can also be done from the inside, or middle (straight up and down.)Jump Spin Kick
Crescent kick (an chagi/bakkat chagi): There are two variations of this kick: the outer crescent and the inner crescent. In the outer, the practitioner raises the extended leg as high as possible, and slightly up across the body, (a bit across the centerline of the body), then sweeping outward to the side, in a circular movement. In the inner, the motions are the same but the direction of the kick changes, this time originating from the outside of the body, heading towards the inside, or centerline of the body. These kicks are also called "inside crescent kick" and "outside crescent kick" at some taekwondo schools.
Reverse Turning Kick (반대 돌려 차기 bandae dollyeo chagi): This kick may appear similar to a hook kick, but is performed with a straight leg, and usually at least a half-rotation. The heel connects with the target.
Spin kicks There are several spinning kicks that involve the rotation of the entire body and head before the kick is released. Spinning kicks include the back pivot kick (dweel chagi), spinning hook kick (dweel huryeo chagi), spinning axe kick, returning kick, 360 turning kick, and a number of other kicks of varying popularity.
Fly Kick (on mondollyo chagi):The practitioner steps forward and spins in the direction of their back leg while raising their knee and jumping to perform a spinning inside crescent kick in midair.
Jump Kicks (뛰어 차기 ttwieo chagi):
Steven Ho: Jump Spin Hook Kick
There are also many kicks that involve jumping before their execution. These include the jumping front kick (ee dan ap chagi), jumping side kick (이단 옆 차기 idan yeop chagi), flying side kick, jumping axe kick, jumping roundhouse (ee dan dollyeo chagi), jumping spinning hook kick, jumping spinning roundhouse kick, jumping back kick, and jump spinning side kick. Normally, jumping kicks involve pulling up the back leg to help gain height during the jump and then performing the kick itself with the front leg.

Advanced kicks: There are a variety of kicks that can be used in combination or stem out from a simple kick to create more difficult ones. Some of these include 540 Kick (One spins 1½ times in mid-air and does a kick, usually a back spinning hook kick), a 720 Kick (the practitioner spins 2 times in mid-air and performs a kick, usually a back spinning hook kick), and Triple Aero Kicks (Practitioner performs round house kick, back spinning hook kick, and another round house kick in mid-air).
Fast Kicks: Also, many kicks can be employed using a fast kick style. The practitioner shuffles the back leg forward to the front leg, and the front leg comes up and kicks closer to the enemy than the practitioner had been before execution. This can be used with side kick, roundhouse kick, front kick, hook kick, and axe kick.
Monkey Kick: This is an awkward, ineffectual kick that is just barely impactful enough to cause hogu that are rigged for electronic scoring to register a point, especially in WT (formerly WTF) - style sparring. It is often cited as an example of how the practice electronic scoring harms sport Taekwondo.  Electronic hogu have embedded sensors that detect the vibration from a blow. In principle, the idea is that a legitimate taekwondo kick (such as a roundhouse kick) will impact the hogu and cause the sensors to vibrate -- thus scoring a point. Because there is no guarantee that the legitimate kick will impact directly on the sensor, the sensors need to be calibrated to detect even "light" impacts. This kick takes advantage of this light calibration by allowing the competitor to score a point with a simple, awkward tap of the foot on the hogu, as long as the impact occurs near a sensor. In the case of a Monkey Kick specifically, this light impact is accomplished by tapping the bottom of the foot against the opponent's sensor while standing very close to the opponent.
After many complaints from different Member National Associations, the WT Technical Commission decided to sanction the athletes who used the technique in excess. The Commission also called all coaches from the participating countries for a meeting so the coaches could express their opinions about the technique and situation[1]
Lower Kick: This kick can disarm the opponent if done with a lot of force but if the opponent is on the guard the kick might not work.
Blocks[edit]
Main article: Blocking (martial arts)
Taekwondo blocks known as Makgi are used to stop and deflect an incoming attack. They engage various parts of the arm with the hand and are held in different positions such as knife-hand, closed fist etc. Each block is suitable for a particular kind of attack and may be combined with another punch or kick to make a counter-attack.

Single Forearm Block - Wae Sun Palmok is used to deflect an attack (usually a kick) made at the torso. Starting up near the opposite shoulder, and the leading hand is projected down and across the body to deflect the kick with the forearm.
Low Block - Najundi Makgi is used to defend against low attacks to the torso or legs. This is one of the most basic Taekwondo blocks and one of the first things a beginner will learn. The lead forearm is bent and raised to shoulder height, snapping the arm down straight with the palm facing the ground, which blocks any incoming low kicks.
Rising Block - Chookya Makgi is another basic Taekwondo block, used to defend against overhead attacks to the head and shoulders. The arm is bent and raised above the head, and the underside of the forearm absorbs the impact of the blow, which may be painful but is better than it connecting with your head or delicate clavicle. This block is used to defend against Hammerfists, Axe Kicks and overhead strikes with blunt instruments.
Palm Block - Sonbadak Naeryo Makgi is a standard block used to deflect incoming kicks and punches. The open hand is raised up to shoulder height and thrust directly down to meet the attackers limb. The heel of the hand makes contact with the attacker's forearm in case of a punch, or shin in case of a kick. Although simple, it requires a lot of partner training to get the timing of this Taekwondo block correct.
Knife Hand Block - The hand is kept in a knife hand position to block attacks to the torso. As the front arms sweeps down in an arc from the inside to the outside of the body, the back hand is simultaneously pulled back to the back hip and ready for a counter punch.
Double Forearm Block - This is a more advanced Taekwondo block, designed to be used against a strong attack to the center of the body. Standing sideways, the lead forearm blocks the attack with the fist closed. The second arm provides further support, linking into the crook of the arm so both forearms are at a 90 degree angle to the body.
Double Knife Hand Block - With the hands held open in the knife hand position, a powerful kick aimed at the solar plexus can be successfully blocked. Both hands come across the body, intersecting at the forearms and providing a firm defence.
Nine Block - This is a black belt leveled block and the first time it is usually used is around the black belt form. The person blocks their chest with one hand and stomach region with the other. The shape of the block forms a number nine when executed correctly. Both arms are bent at a 45 degree angle as well and it leaves little space open in the mid region of the defenders body. Your hand when this move is executed correctly should also be above your groin on the bottom and next to you opposite shoulder with the top hand.
Upper Block - Also known as the Ulgul Makgi.  The one using the block first keeps their fist sideways at the stomach or torso. They then rise the fist up to their head, deflecting the attack.  Any attack made at the upper part of the body is blocked if timed correctly using this block.
Patterns, poomsae, hyung, tul[edit]
Taekwondo patterns, also known as poomsae, teul, or hyeong constitute an important part of Taekwondo competitions.[2] A pattern is a series of movements linked together in a prescribed sequence. Both basic and advanced taekwondo techniques can be contained within a single patterns and the higher the level of the competitor, the greater the difficulty of the techniques and the complexity of the pattern. Competitors must perform their highest pattern in front of a panel of judges.
There are three types of Taekwondo pattern competition:

Team Taekwondo patterns - Performed simultaneously by several competitors from a club organised into a single team. Club teams compete by performing two patterns each, one after the other. Once one team have finished both their patterns can the competing team then perform theirs. Again, the judges choose the best pattern to go through to the next round.
In taekwondo tournaments, pattern competitions are generally graded on:

Realism. Taekwondo patterns are the learning ground for real combat. As such, every technique must display the requisite speed, power and firmness to be realistically used as an attack or defines move.
Spirit. A competitor's 'presence' on the mat must be as credible as his technique. Self belief, confidence in abilities, and intention to perform to a personal best are tangible virtues considered indispensable in Taekwondo practitioners.
Decorum. Proper manners must be displayed when interacting with the judges directly before and after the pattern. Respect must also be extended to rival competitors, clubs and other officials.
Form. General qualities that judges look for in any Taekwondo practitioner include proper breathing technique and body control. The diaphragm must be engaged in deep breathing, shallow breathing concentrated in the upper abdomen results in raised shoulders and stressed muscles. The muscles of the body should be lightly relaxed in order to perform the pattern with fluidity, speed and grace. Muscles should only be tensed at the moment of imaginary impact in order to commute maximum power to any individual Taekwondo technique.

Self defense[edit]
Taekwondo self-defense is known as kinuo and it forms one of the 20 main principles of the art. The self-defense applications would be difficult to score in sparring as they are designed primarily to cause injury or quickly incapacitate an adversary.
In competition, self-defense techniques take the format of a demonstration event, much like ponomoom. One person is usually designated the part of the Taekwondo practitioner, while several teammates take the role of common street aggressors who attack from various angles with punches, kicks and grabs common to street brawlers. Weapons may also be used, as Taekwondo has specific techniques for dealing with armed adversaries.
Taekwondo self-defense competition provides an opportunity for students to display their understanding of Taekwondo self-defense applications and the ability to put together their own team choreography. Self-defense routines are often performed as displays for the public, in which case there are no judges present. Many Taekwondo clubs include self-defense in their daily routine in both WTF and ITF.
There are two main concepts in Taekwondo self-defense. For real life combat situations, an experienced Taekwondo practitioner is versed in the following:

Linear (or hard) techniques
Circular (or soft) techniques
Linear Techniques
These include mostly punching, kicking, headbutts and other striking maneuvers. Force is countered with force and all limbs are involved in stopping an adversary. Taekwondo kicks have a wide reach that keeps the adversary at a distance. With proper execution opponents may be incapacitated with a single blow, which lessens the number of attacks in encounters with multiple people.
Circular techniques
These emphasize redirection and manipulation rather than strength. The adversary can be manipulated into a position whereby a lock, stranglehold and/or finishing move can be applied. Grappling techniques are used both as a means of securing an adversary and escaping from an adversary's grip. Soft self-defense techniques like the stranglehold or joint lock can be used to subdue the attacker, avoiding dealing permanent injury.
Taekwondo self-defense techniques demonstrated in competition may include:

Pressure point applications.[9] In Taekwondo philosophy, the body has many sensitive areas that are susceptible to precise attack. These are known as pressure points or ji ap sul. There are three types of pressure point that can induce one or a combination of the following: pain, paralysis, or death. These can be targeted with gripping and/or striking in order to immobilize or cause substantial pain to submit the opponent.
Throws. Known as too sul, Taekwondo practitioners can divert the opponent's force to their own advantage and throw him to the ground. Once on the ground the practitioner has greater control over his adversary and can follow up with subsequent controlling or finishing techniques.
Joint Locks. Otherwise known as kwan jyel sul in Taekwondo, these can be useful against armed attackers. Typically the attacking limb is grabbed and then manipulated to cause immense pain in the adversary. Joint locks can be applied on any joint in the body and are particularly useful for controlling an opponent who has been thrown to the ground.
Termination techniques. These are a range of strikes applied to an opponent downed by a previous throw or strike. Powerful downward traveling kicks and hand strikes are used to make sure the opponent stays down.
Choking techniques. In chil sik sul, the idea of applying a stranglehold is to deprive the attacker's brain of either oxygenated blood through the carotid artery and/or oxygen for the lungs through the trachea. The Taekwondo practitioner uses leverage from his arm and sometimes involves the attackers clothing in applying pressure to the sensitive neck area. Choke holds are particularly dangerous and only taught to higher level Taekwondo students, as over exertion can crush the trachea or cause sudden death.
Freeing techniques. Paegi are taught to Taekwondo students so that they can quickly free themselves and neutralise the danger of being grabbed by an attacker. Competition demonstrations frequently involve one student grabbing another from behind. The science of Taekwondo is equally concerned with defense as attack so proper freeing techniques must be learnt.
Like other Taekwondo competition events, self-defense is marked by a panel of judges. When scoring they are looking at the following factors:

Aliveness. How realistic is the Taekwondo students demonstration? Does he move with the requisite urgency and do his techniques have the emotional content to make the judges believe in their power?
Technique. Are the Taekwondo techniques being demonstrated precisely? Are the kicks clean, fast and strong? Are joint locks and throws being performed accurately? Does the student have control over his adversaries or are they making it easy for him?
Variety. What is the range of the Taekwondo practitioners knowledge? Is he showing his understanding of liner and direct counter-attacks? Has he performed a practical finishing technique after each throw or lock?
Difficulty. More difficult Taekwondo techniques score higher than simple ones if performed correctly. However, a poorly executed technique will always score lower than a simple, effective technique performed well; students should not be demonstrating techniques that they have not mastered.

Norman Smith was a British Labour Party councillor of the London Borough of Lewisham from 1978 until 1990, and civil Mayor of Lewisham for three terms.


Personal life[edit]
Smith was born in Leigh on 25 January 1919, descended from colliers. 
He married Joan Margery Parkinson in Lewisham in 1945 and they lived together on the Downham Estate.  Joan had been born in Greenwich on 7 October 1925.
Smith supported Millwall F.C..[1] He died on 3 March 1993,[2] and his wife Joan followed him on 6 July 2006.

Community work[edit]
Smith was Chairman of the Downham (Wesley Halls) Community Association from at least 1979. The Association's records reflect that his contributions included cutting the grass and repairing broken windows. 
[3]

Local councillor[edit]
Together with Thomas I. Bradley and Frederick A. Barrett, Smith was elected Labour councillor for the Downham ward of the London Borough of Lewisham in successive local elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986, winning the majority on all three occasions.[4][5][6] Labour's run in Downham came to an end when the Liberal Democrat Focus Team obtained the greater share of the vote in the 1990 local elections and a 1992  by-election.[7][8]

Mayor of Lewisham[edit]
Smith served three terms as Mayor of Lewisham, in 1983–4, and from 1986 until 1988.
[9]
His mayoral engagements included:

Welcoming Princess Diana to Deptford when she visited The Albany arts centre on 23 May 1984; and [10][11][12]Greeting Prince Charles in Deptford High Street on 18 July 1986, when Charles opened the Deptford Enterprise Agency.[13]
Norman and Joan Smith greeting Charles, then Prince of Wales, in Deptford High Street, 18 July 1986
In November 1986, Smith traded places for a day with 77-year-old great-grandmother Daisy Williamson, a former cleaner of Bellingham, South East London, after Williamson wrote a poem about her dream of being mayor. Smith took up Williamson's dustpan and pinny and waited on her at Lewisham Town Hall, while Williamson donned Smith's mayoral regalia.[14][15][16][17]
As Mayor, Smith's unveilings included: 

On 14 March 1987, together with British Rail Area Manager Nicholas Woods, a plaque commemorating the London and Greenwich Railway at Deptford railway station; and [18][19]On 2 May 1987, a maroon plaque memorialising Richard Jefferies at 20 Sydenham Park Road, London SE26 4ED.[20]
In June 1987, Smith joined Glenda Jackson in launching the Reminiscence Centre in Blackheath, a centre for creative activities for older people run by Age Exchange.[21][22]
In October 1987 Smith attended the launch of the Festival of London, following which a correspondent for the Daily Telegraph reported: 

"Having told me he believes that people are fed up with boring mayors, the cheerful Smith promptly leapt on to the stage with the town crier to dance a calypso to a steel band".[1]
Memorials[edit]
A plaque in the vestibule of St Barnabas Church, Downham reads:

“THE GROUNDS OF THIS CHURCH WERE IMPROVED BY THE COUNCIL IN MEMORY OF THE LIFE OF NORMAN SMITH, FORMER MAYOR OF LEWISHAM AND LONG STANDING MEMBER OF THIS CONGREGATION. JULY 1993”.[23]

Groß Ellershausen is a village (borough: Ortsteil) in Göttingen, Germany.  The village lies  on highway B3, west of the southern part of the city proper, separated from it and the River Leine by the Autobahn A7.  Further west, just beyond the village is the 77 hectare local forest, Genossenschaftsforst Groß Ellershausen.[1]  From the village, running north and then through the forest is a bicycle- cum foot-path built on the old Hannöversche Südbahn railway line.


History[edit]
St. Martin's Church in Groß Ellershausen, the steeple was built in the 10th or 11th century.
As long ago as the early neolithic, the present area of the village held settlements, as witnessed by the large number of LBK findings[1]
The earliest written record of the village is from the year 989 in the Traditiones Corbeyenses of the Corvey Abbey (III § B 115b), where it is called "Aliershusun".[2]
The village church was built in the 11th century, and is one of the oldest structures in southern Lower Saxony.[3]
In 1144, the village was presented to the Bursfelde Abbey.[3]  In a record from 1574, the earliest record of the name "Ellershausen" can be found.[4]
During the Thirty Years War, the village suffered the depredations of war and pillage common to the era and area.  Once again, in the Seven Years' War, the village was brutally used by Freikorps Fischer.[1]
The village has suffered more than once the ravages of flood-waters.  The earliest known such disastrous flooding was on 29 April 1800, with damaging high water also coming in August 2007.[1]
Through the 19th century the village was an agricultural community that also profited from the orderly exploitation of the village woodland.  A few craftsmen also plied their trades.  In 1856, the  (Ib.) Hannöversche Südbahn was completed, with the line passing through the community.  However, it was not until 1931 that trains stopped at the village.  In 1980, the line was discontinued.[1] By this time, bus service and possession of personal automobiles were commonplace and extensive, and a significant proportion of the villagers were commuters to work or school in nearby Göttingen.
In 1932, the village had the word Gross added to it, to distinguish it from Ellershausen vor dem Walde near Hanover.[1] The village was incorporated into Göttingen in 1973.

Economy[edit]
There are over fifty businesses in the village.[5]
There is a volunteer fire department.[6]

Education[edit]
Younger children attend the Mittelbergschule, which also services Hetjershausen and Knutbühren.[7]  Older children attend school in Göttingen.

Government[edit]
Mayor: Heidrun von der Heide
The Ortsrat has 4 CDU members and 5 members (including the mayor) from the SPD.[8]

Demographics[edit]
The population of the village stood at 1,421 in 2006.

Religion[edit]
The community is, like the region in general, predominantly Lutheran. There is one church in the village, St. Martin's Church,[9] built in the 10th or 11th century[3] and said to be one of the oldest surviving structures in southern Lower Saxony.
Administratively, the church is part of the Sprengel Hildesheim-Göttingen der Evangelisch-lutherischen Landeskirche Hannovers.[10]

Social aspects[edit]
Since at least the early 19th century, there have been a number of  social facilities and societies and clubs in Groß Ellershausen.

In sport a semi-closed league (also referred to as a semi-open league) is a sports league where a group of teams are guaranteed entry into the league every season, while another group of teams have to qualify or stand at risk of relegation following each season. It is considered a hybrid of closed leagues and leagues with promotion and relegation. Semi-closed leagues can lead to a league where its permanent members are richer vis-à-vis the remaining teams in these semi-closed leagues or teams in more local competitions in which permanent members compete.[1]

Examples[edit]
The following are examples of leagues said to be semi-closed:

EuroLeague[2][3]
The proposal for a European Super League in 2021
The NASCAR Cup Series since the implementation of the charter system in 2016
FIVB Men's and Women's Volleyball Nations League
The Honor of Kings Pro League (since 2020)

Project description[edit]
The Rodenbach sculpture trail is part of the hiking trail network of the collective municipality of Weilerbach. It begins at Dorfweiher and runs along the nature reserve to the old Steige (climbing trail). Along the path there are 19 sculptures or groups of sculptures.

History[edit]
In 1991, the municipality of Rodenbach invited schoolgirls from the stone sculpturing class of the German "master school" (Meisterschule) in Kaiserslautern to create a sculpture trail in Rodenbach. Head teachers, departmental schoolteachers and sponsors helped to realise the project. As a theme for the works, motives related to the local area were chosen: water or Celtic history.
In 2003, the sculptor, Ludwig Grub, who had lived in Rodenbach for many years, created the Summstein ("humming rock"), (Sculpture Way, Pos. 2) and the Rodenbacher Tümpelkriecher ("Rodenbach puddle creeper") on the village pond, (Sculpture Way, Pos. 3); as well as the well in Rathausstraße for which old cattle troughs were used.[1]

Shūkan Shinchō (週刊新潮) is a Japanese conservative[1][2] weekly news magazine based in Tokyo, Japan. It is considered one of the most influential weekly magazines in the country[2] and is the first Japanese weekly magazine founded by a publishing company which does not own a major newspaper.[3][4]


History and profile[edit]
Shūkan Shinchō was first published on 19 February 1956.[5] The cover of the first issue featured an illustration by Japanese artist Rokuro Taniuchi.[5][6] The magazine is part of Shinchosha, which also founded it, and is published on a weekly basis.[5] Its headquarters is in Tokyo.[7]
Shūkan Shinchō is a general-news magazine, but it targets men.[2] It claims that "[its] average reader is 41.4 years old, 34.2% are white collar, and 60.9% own their own homes" and that "the majority [of its readers] are upper class, wealthy and intellectually inclined".[2] As of 2017 Mark Schreiber, a contributing author of Japan Times, argued that the readers of the magazine are mostly older and retired Japanese men.[8] The major competitor of the magazine is Shūkan Bunshun.[9]

Shūkan Shinchō has a nationalistic and conservative political stance.[2] Shūkan Shinchō and its rival Shūkan Bunshun are the only major "non-establishment" weekly news-magazines that do not feature pornography. This makes them the magazines of choice for men who want to read so-called alternative news (sources other than the major newspapers and broadcasters) but who don't want to look at, or be seen looking at, pornography.[2] As a result, these two Shūkanshi (weekly magazines) are seen as more socially acceptable to read than their rivals.[2] The layouts of these two magazines are also of a better quality than that of their direct competitors.[2] However, these two publications have been described as "especially egregious offenders of journalistic ethics".[2] Shūkan Shinchō is also described as a tabloid magazine by Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Japanese daily.[9] Shūkan Shinchō was found guilty of libel in a Tokyo court for publishing an unsubstantiated allegation of murder by a Soka Gakkai member.[10] The magazine was criticized in 2001 for sensationalistic stories regarding a disputed Paleolithic settlement site in Japan.[11] It has also been rebuked for publishing the names and photographs of minors who have been accused of criminal acts, even before their trials began.[7]

Circulation[edit]
From October 2014 to September 2015 Shūkan Shinchō was the ninth-best selling magazine in Japan with a circulation of 537,596 copies.[12]

2× All-Star (1996, 1997)

Todd Randolph Hundley (born May 27, 1969) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher and outfielder. He was a two-time All-Star who played for 14 seasons with the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Chicago Cubs.


Early life[edit]
Hundley was born in Martinsville, Virginia, and  grew up in Illinois, where his father, Randy, was a catcher for the Chicago Cubs. Hundley attended William Fremd High School in Palatine, Illinois, where he played on the school baseball and hockey teams. As a switch-hitting junior, he led his team in runs batted in and had a batting average of .357.[1]

Professional career[edit]
The Mets selected Hundley in the second round of the 1987 MLB draft with the 39th overall pick. He was selected as a compensation pick from the Baltimore Orioles for signing Ray Knight.[2]
Hundley made his major league debut with the New York Mets on May 18, 1990, when he was 20 years old. He came up with great fanfare but did not hit very well in his first few years in the Major Leagues.[3] Hundley described himself as overmatched early in his career.[4]
After a few years and a few injuries, his hitting increasingly improved to match his defense. He began to break out in the strike-shortened 1994 season and that breakout continued into the following seasons.[5] In 1996, Hundley hit 41 home runs, setting the Mets single-season home run record (previously set by Darryl Strawberry in 1988) and the single-season record for catchers (previously set by Roy Campanella in 1953).[6][7][8] Carlos Beltrán subsequently tied the team record in 2006 and Pete Alonso broke it in 2019.[9] Javy López broke the positional record in 2003.[10] Hundley was named to the National League All-Star team for the first time in 1996 and then again 1997. He also received votes for the Most Valuable Player Award in 1996.[3]
The Mets' acquisition of perennial All-Star Mike Piazza in May 1998 combined with a career-threatening elbow injury brought his tenure with the Mets to a close. With Piazza on the roster, the Mets moved Hundley to left field where he had little success.[11] He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on December 1, 1998, in a three-team trade that brought Armando Benítez and Roger Cedeño to the Mets while also sending fellow catcher Charles Johnson to the Baltimore Orioles.[12]
Rob Neyer later summarized the trajectory of Hundley's tenure with the Mets as "overmatched, dangerous, hurt, Piazza, gone."[13]
While playing for the Dodgers in 2000, Hundley became the first visiting player to hit a home run into McCovey Cove at what was then Pacific Bell Park (now Oracle Park).[14]
After two seasons in Los Angeles, Hundley signed with the Chicago Cubs for four years and $23.5 million in December 2000.[15] Hundley spent two seasons in Chicago where he was both unproductive on the field and unpopular with fans.[16][17][18]
Only two years into his contract, he was traded back to Los Angeles with Chad Hermansen for Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek before the 2003 season. His final season came in 2003. Despite not playing in 2004, he was paid $7 million.[3]
In 2007, the Mitchell Report revealed that Mets clubhouse attendant Kirk Radomski told investigators he sold Deca-Durabolin to Hundley prior to his 1996 record-breaking season.[19]

Personal life[edit]
On January 6, 1990, Todd married his high school sweetheart Tiffany Saarinen.
As of September 1998[update], Hundley and his wife, have four children, Heather, Justin, Emma and Josh.[20] By August 2005, he and Tiffany were divorced.[21]
In August 2005, Hundley was arrested and charged in Lake County, Illinois, with driving under the influence and endangering the life and health of children after being pulled over in his Hummer H2 with his two daughters in the backseat and failing field sobriety tests. Hundley attributed his condition to the prescription painkiller Vicodin.[22]
Hundley married Jodi A. Contreras Shupe on March 2, 2006, in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[23]
In May 2012, Hundley sold his six-bedroom Glenview, Illinois, home for $1.4 million, $200,000 less than his 2004 purchase price.[24]

BANK was an artists' group active in London during the 1990s.


History and project[edit]
Simon Bedwell and John Russell spent a few years on sporadic art events and fake mailout-only 'shows' in the years after leaving St Martins artschool, then in 1991 organised their first proper show, with fellow ex-St Martins friend Dino Demosthenous, in an ex-Barclays on Lewisham Way, South London; this is where the name BANK came from.[citation needed] Dino Demosthenous left in 1992. In 1993, Russell and Bedwell were joined by Milly Thompson, David Burrows and Andrew Williamson (Bedwell, Burrows and Williamson having worked as a group sporadically for the 2 years previously, with shows at Richard Demarco gallery Edinburgh, and Clove 2, London). Burrows left BANK in 1995, Williamson in 1998, Russell in 2000. When BANK's own gallery, Gallerie Poo Poo, closed after the three-day show Press Release in January 1999,[citation needed] the group began to exhibit their collective work in other venues: The Mayor Gallery, London, Magasin 4, Bregenz, Rupert Goldsworthy Gallery, New York, Anthony Wilkinson Gallery, London, Chapman FineARTS, London, Suburban, Chicago, and finally the inaugural show at Store, London, after which Milly Thompson and Simon Bedwell began to work separately as artists whilst managing the BANK archive. BANK works have continued to circulate in exhibitions in the UK and abroad, most recently in The Banquet Years, a mini-retrospective at MOT International, London, who now represent the 'estate' of BANK as well as Bedwell and Russell.[citation needed]
BANK's contribution to UK contemporary art was a series of curated group shows, often with comical, and sometimes offensive, titles. As a group they adopted an aggressive stance towards the mainstream contemporary art scene of the time.[citation needed]
The approximately twenty shows curated by BANK included the work of the BANK artists alongside the work of several future Turner Prize nominees and winners. Although the BANK exhibitions were mostly held in warehouse spaces on Curtain Road, then Underwood Street (both Shoreditch, London) the name of the gallery changed. Initially it was BANKSPACE, then DOG, and finally Gallerie Poo-Poo.  The various artworks were bound together, via polemical mailouts, deliberately overt thematizing and radically non-hierarchical methods of display, within single sprawling installations with a penchant for what then seemed like visual vulgarity.
BANK also published a satirical magazine delivering tabloid-style critiques of the art world. Headlines included, "AD MAN YOU’RE A BAD MAN," and, "GALLERIES 'ALL OWNED BY RICH PEOPLE' SHOCK."[1] Other "frankly adolescent" headlines were "ARSE COUNCIL", "SIMON PATTERSON - ONE IDEA, EIGHT YEARS", "CARRY ON CURATING", "PIPPA-LOTTA-RIST-ACTION" and "SAM-TAYLOR WOULD-NOT"[2] These 34 tabloids, along with the Fax-Back project - in which gallery press releases were returned to galleries with corrections and commentary - have since become BANK's best known work.[citation needed]
Julian Stallabrass describes BANK’s activity as "the parodic creation of corporate identity at the centre of which (as their name suggests) is a noisy and constant reference to that matter of which the art world usually whispers: money."[3] They had, according to Matthew Collings, a "surly, self-destructive, self-conscious, introspective attitude - combined...with critical intelligence and a flair for spotting weaknesses in the art system".[4]

World Almanac AuthorMultipleCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishSubjectReferencePublisherWorld Almanac Books (imprint of Skyhorse Publishing)Publication dateNovember 28, 2023 (1st: 1868)Media typePrinted BookPages1,008ISBN978-1-5107-7246-5
The World Almanac and Book of Facts is a US-published reference work, an almanac conveying information about such subjects as world changes, tragedies, and sports feats. It has been published yearly from 1868 to 1875, and again every year since 1886.[1]


History[edit]
19th century[edit]
The first edition of The World Almanac was published by the New York World newspaper in 1868 (the name of the publication comes from the newspaper itself, which was known as the World). Published three years after the end of the US Civil War and the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, its 120 pages of information touched on such events as the process of Reconstruction and the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.
Publication was suspended in 1876, but in 1886, newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer, who had purchased the World and quickly transformed it into one of the most influential newspapers in the country, revived The World Almanac with the intention of making it "a compendium of universal knowledge." The World Almanac has been published annually since. From 1890 to 1934, the New York World Building was prominently featured on its cover.[2]

The World Almanac and Book of Facts, 1987, besides a tea kettle, TIPA, Dharamsala, India
In 1894, when it claimed more than a half-million "habitual users," The World Almanac changed its name to The World Almanac and Encyclopedia. This was the title it kept until 1923, when it became The World Almanac and Book of Facts, the name it bears today.

20th century[edit]
In 1906, the New York Times, reporting on the publishing of the 20th edition, said that "the almanac has made for itself a secure position, second only to the forty-year-old Whitaker's Almanac of London, with which alone it can be compared."[3]
In 1923, the name changed to its current name, The World Almanac and Book of Facts.[1]
Calvin Coolidge's father read from The World Almanac when he swore his son into office.[1] Since then, photos have shown that Presidents John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton have also used The World Almanac as a resource.[1]
In 1931 The New York World merged with the Scripps-owned Telegram to form the New York World-Telegram. The World-Telegram subsequently acquired the assets of The Sun in 1950, and officially became the New York World-Telegram and The Sun. Ownership of the Almanac passed to the Newspaper Enterprise Association (another Scripps-owned business) in 1966, when the World-Telegram merged with the New York Herald Tribune and the New York Journal-American.[4]
During World War II, The World Almanac could boast that it was read by GIs all over the world: between 1944 and 1946, at the request of the U.S. Government, The World Almanac had special print runs of 100,000 to 150,000 copies for distribution to the armed forces.
In late December 1984, the 1985 edition reached first place in the category of paperback Advice, How- To and Miscellaneous books, on the New York Times best-seller list, with more than 1,760,000 copies sold at the time.[5]
The first version of the video game Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, published in 1985, included a copy of The World Almanac in the purchase.[6]
From the 1968 to 1986 editions the Almanac bore the imprints of local newspapers (in New York,the Daily News for most of the time) in various markets while published by NEA.
Thereafter it was branded with "World Almanac Books", initially as an imprint of Pharos Books, another Scripps-owned entity, until the sales noted below.
Over the decades The World Almanac has been featured in several Hollywood films. Fred MacMurray talks about it with Edward G. Robinson in Double Indemnity; Bette Davis screams about it in All About Eve; Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper flirt about it in Love in the Afternoon; it is featured in Miracle on 34th Street when a trial is held to see if Santa Claus really exists; Rosie Perez continually reads it in the film White Men Can't Jump; and Will Smith checks it for the exact time of sunset so he can set his digital watch in I Am Legend.
The World Almanac For Kids was published annually since 1995 until 2014.
In 1993 Scripps sold The World Almanac to K-III (later Primedia). The World Almanac was sold to Ripplewood Holdings' WRC Media in 1999. Ripplewood bought Reader's Digest and the book was then produced by the World Almanac Education Group, which was owned by The Reader's Digest Association.

21st century[edit]
The World Almanac was sold to Infobase Publishing in 2009. In 2018, The World Almanac published its 150-year anniversary edition.[7] The World Almanac,together with the "World Almanac Books" imprint used since the closing years of Scripps ownership, was sold to Skyhorse Publishing in 2020. 
As with other Skyhorse imprints it is distributed by Simon & Schuster.[8]

Editing and publishing[edit]
In the mid-1980s, The World Almanac was being put together by a 10-member staff. At that time, 20 percent of the book was rarely updated (for example, the text of the Constitution of the United States), 50 percent was updated at least briefly each year, and 30 percent of the content was completely new each year.[5]

Hilary McGrady (born in 1966) is a Northern Irish arts and cultural activist and environmentalist.[1] She became Director-General of the National Trust in March 2018.[2]


Early life and education[edit]
Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, McGrady grew up during The Troubles in Northern Ireland. McGrady’s father was a builder, while her mother looked after Hilary and her two siblings.[1] A career advisor at McGrady's school suggested she become a hairdresser, but she instead studied Graphic Design at art college.[1]

Career[edit]
After finishing her degree in Graphic Design, McGrady worked as a designer before moving into marketing, including as a Brand Manager for Diageo, the global drinks company.[3] She moved into the charity sector, heading the Northern Irish organisation Arts & Business.[4]

Belfast European Capital of Culture Bid[edit]
Following the departure of Shona McCarthy, McGrady joined the Imagine Belfast 2008 team as Chief Executive to lead the city’s bid to become European Capital of Culture.[4] Although the bid was unsuccessful, it led to the creation of a new a new Culture and Arts Plan 2003–2006 for the city, credited with boosting cultural activity and tourism.[5]

National Trust[edit]
In 2006 McGrady joined the National Trust as regional director for Northern Ireland. She later became Regional Director for Wales and for London and South East region. In 2014 she was appointed Chief Operating Officer, leading the Operations and Consultancy teams.[5]
In December 2017 it was announced that McGrady would succeed Helen Ghosh as Director-General of the Trust[6] and she started the role in March 2018. She is the organisation’s first Director-General not to have attended Oxbridge.[7]
In 2020 the Trust celebrated its 125th anniversary, with McGrady announcing that the organisation would reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030, including the planting of 20 million trees.[8] She also pledged to create 20 "green corridors" connecting urban areas with wilder countryside for people and nature. The first of these was announced in Bath in 2022.[9]
The majority of the anniversary celebrations were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with McGrady making a number of media interventions on the organisation's financial losses, and the need for a sustainable recovery.[10]
The publication of a research document exploring National Trust places' links with slavery and colonialism in 2020 attracted controversy. McGrady revealed in January 2022 that she had received death threats, although she had not reported these to the police because, she said, such abuse "comes with the territory."[11]
On 28 July 2023 McGrady was one of a number of signatories to an open letter to the Prime Minister expressing alarm about the UK Government's environmental policy. In her capacity as Director-General of the National Trust she said that the Trust's membership supported her in speaking up "for the future of life on this one precious planet" and warned that she would not "stand by whilst politicians use the environment as a political football".[12][13]

Personal[edit]
Hilary lives in County Antrim with her husband, whom she met at art college. Their relationship initially caused difficulty for her family who were Protestants and unionists, while her husband came from a Catholic, nationalist area.[1] They have three grown-up children. She lists her interests as the arts, gardening and hill walking.[2]

Garner–Hayfield Community School District was a school district headquartered in Garner, Iowa; circa 1998 it was the second largest employer in that city. In addition it served the unincorporated areas of Duncan, Hayfield, and Miller. Circa 1998 it had 950 students.[1]
For a period the district shared specialized classes with the Ventura Community School District. Beginning in 2012, the two districts began a whole grade-sharing program in which students from one district attended school in the other district, with high school students at Garner and with middle school students at Ventura.[2]
The election to determine whether the districts would merge was held on September 9, 2014, with 602–22 in Garner–Hayfield and 351–51 counts in Ventura favoring the merger.[3] Approval required each district to have over half of its constituents to vote in favor.[4] They merged into the new Garner–Hayfield–Ventura Community School District on July 1, 2015.[5]

Schools[edit]
It previously operated Garner–Hayfield K–8 (Elementary and Middle) and Garner–Hayfield High.[6]

The European Tribe First UK editionAuthorCaryl PhillipsCountryUnited KingdomLanguageEnglishGenreEssaysPublisherFaber and FaberPublication date1987Media typePrint
The European Tribe is the first book of essays by Caryl Phillips, published in 1987 (in the UK by Faber and Faber and in the US by Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Characterised by Andrea Lee in The New York Times as "part travelogue, part cri de coeur",[1] the collection chronicles the author's journey through multiracial Europe of the 1980s, "guided by a moral compass rather than a map" and "seeking personal definition within the parameters of growing up black in Europe".[2] Maya Jaggi of The Guardian has called it "a coolly indignant dissection of the 'sickness in Europe's soul'".[3]

According to a review in The Caribbean Writer, "The topics of race, nationality and culture have loomed large in the consciousness of 20th century individuals, and they continue to attract literary writers of diverse sensibilities. Rarely, however, has the black writer attempted to grapple with such impassioned issues among Europeans; it is an enticing subject, for which Mr. Phillips would appear to be exceptionally equipped."[4] Charles R. Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote: "Novelist Caryl Phillips' brief, eye-opening book, The European Tribe, is one black man's answer to Tocqueville's classic [Democracy in America], and may well become a classic of cultural exploration itself. ...Phillips' true theme in his travels everywhere is the global disenfranchisement of black people at a time when 'America has conquered Europe economically, politically, and culturally.' In 1831, Tocqueville wrote of Americans: 'The taste for superiority crops up everywhere.' A century and a half later, Phillips sees Europe in decline, America, 'the Frankenstein that Europe created risen from the slab,' and right-wing extremism becoming increasingly the solution to unemployment, hopelessness, and disillusionment in Western Europe.

The European Tribe, comprised partly of personal odyssey, partly of political indictment, is too important a book to be ignored."[5]
The European Tribe was awarded the Martin Luther King Memorial Prize in 1987.[6]

Phractura is a genus of loach catfishes (order Siluriformes) that occur in Africa.
Phractura species are elongated fish with a long caudal peduncle and bony scutes on the sides, back, and belly.,[1] this feature giving the genus its name from the Greek phraktos, which means enclosed and oura which means tail.[2] Phractura species are often associated with vegetation.[1] The genus was originally given the name Peltura but this name was preoccupied by a genus of trilobites which the name Peltura had been applied to by Louis Agassiz in 1846.[3] Phractura species, like other genera in Doumeinae, have a mouth modified into a suckermouth that allows it to clean to the objects and scrape the surface of the substrate.[4]

Species[edit]
There are currently 13 recognized species in this genus:[5]

Phractura ansorgii Boulenger, 1902 (African whiptailed catfish)
Phractura bovei Perugia, 1892

Tadahito "Tad" Mochinaga (持永 只仁, Mochinaga Tadahito, March 3, 1919 – April 1, 1999) was a pioneer Japanese stop-motion animator.[1] Having done many stop motion films/shorts in Japan, he is best known as the animator for Rankin/Bass' "Animagic" productions at his MOM Studio in Tokyo throughout the 1960s. He did this work in association with American director Arthur Rankin, Jr. who wrote and designed the productions before sending them to Japan for animation.
In 1945, Mochinaga traveled to Xinjing in the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo set up in occupied China, to work at the Manchukuo Film Association. He stayed in China after the war and from 1950, he spent three years in Shanghai working on such films as Thank You, Kitty.  He is perhaps the only major artist of the era to have worked in both the Chinese and Japanese animation industries.


Biography[edit]
Mochinaga began his animation career in the middle of WWII Japan. During this time, he was the assistant of Seo Mitsuyo on Momotarō's Sea Eagles, an animated propaganda film depicting the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Mochinaga was officially in charge of backgrounds and visual effects. Most Japanese children at this time were taken on official school trips to watch the film. Mochinaga was not particularly happy about this. He wrote in his memoirs:"I heard that many youths volunteered for the flying corps and that while they were on duty they died on air raids. I wonder whether the film we made influenced their decision to volunteer... I thought, in the future I only wished to make a film that would benefit the young, difficult though that might be."[2]Shortly after the release of Momotarō's Sea Eagles, Mochinaga was put in charge of Fuku-Chan's Submarine despite his own protests that he was too inexperienced. Due to the fact that much of his staff was drafted to the military and lack of supplies and funds, Fuku-Chan's Submarine was barely finished and released in 1944.
Exhausted, Mochinaga returned home to find it destroyed in a bombing raid. Foreseeing the end of the war and fearing the inevitable American occupation of Japan that might involve purging propagandists as well as food shortages, Mochinaga fled with his pregnant wife to Japan-occupied Manchuria where they both had family. There, he got a job at Man-Ei as a graphic artist. Less than a month after moving to Manchuria, Japan surrendered.
Fearing what would happen now that the Japanese army had fled, the Japanese workers attempted to flee but were captured by the Soviet army. Fortunately for Mochinaga, he was rehired at the now rebranded Northeast Film Studio. While there, he was given papers identifying him as a Chinese film worker and the Soviets did not seem to consider that a Japanese National could be a film worker in China. He was then given the job of subtitling Soviet films for Chinese, Korean, and Japanese markets. While there, he was able to pull other Japanese refugees into the company and get them work, including Oshiro Noboru.
Mochinaga soon found himself in another war zone as the Chinese National and Communist armies battled for dominance over Manchuria. After he and his staff were captured trying to flee to Hao Gang, he had to confess to being Japanese. However, lucky for him, he happened to be captured by the Eighth Route Army, a Prisoner of War-friendly organization.
In 1946, the frontline of China's Civil War moved further south, allowing Japanese nationals to finally return home. However, Mochinaga chose to stay. There, he avoided censorship by concentration on map graphics and subtitles. During this time, there was only an estimated 20,000 feet of unexposed film left in China. Mochinaga (and all Chinese filmmakers at the time) had to be very careful with the amount of film they used. Mochinaga was forced to mix his own homemade paints from what he could scavenge.
Mochinaga was assigned the task of animating a propaganda comic drawn by Hua Junwu. In order to save the paints, he built puppets and to save film, he shot it frame-by-frame instead of live. This was a resounding success as many in the region fondly remembered going to puppet shows. Thus, Mochinaga accidentally popularized stop motion in China.
Mochinaga continued to work as a successful animator and filmmaker in China for the next decade, finally returning to his home country in 1954, four years before the massive famines in 1958.[3]

On 21 December 1975, six terrorists attacked the semi-annual meeting of OPEC leaders in Vienna, Austria; the attackers took more than 60 hostages after killing an Austrian policeman, an Iraqi OPEC security officer, and a Libyan economist. Several other individuals were wounded. The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group was led by Carlos the Jackal. The siege resulted in complex diplomatic negotiations.[1] It ended two days later, after flights to Algiers and Tripoli, with all the hostages and terrorists walking away from the situation.[2] The fact that this was one of the first times that Arab states were targeted by terrorists also led to them being more cooperative in developing antiterrorism efforts at the United Nations.[3]


Background[edit]
At his trial, the former terrorist Hans-Joachim Klein revealed that the masterminds of the attack came from Libya.[4] He testified in court in 2000 that the information about the security measures at the conference and the weapons came from Libya. Only under this condition could the campaign have been started.[5][4]

Siege[edit]
The path taken by the attackers inside OPEC Headquarters
On 21 December 1975, Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum Ahmed Zaki Yamani and the other oil ministers of the members of OPEC were taken hostage in Vienna, Austria, where the ministers were attending a meeting at the OPEC headquarters at Dr-Karl-Lueger-Ring 10 (renamed Universitätsring in 2012). The hostage attack was orchestrated by a six-person team led by Venezuelan terrorist Carlos the Jackal (which included two West Germans Gabriele Kröcher-Tiedemann, Hans-Joachim Klein, Lebanese Anis al-Naqqash and Syrian Kamal Kheir Beik[6]). The self-named "Arm of the Arab Revolution" group called for the liberation of Palestine. Carlos planned to take over the conference by force and kidnap all eleven oil ministers in attendance and hold them for ransom, with the exception of Ahmed Zaki Yamani and Iran's oil minister Jamshid Amuzegar, who were to be executed.
Carlos led his team past two Austrian police officers in the building's lobby and up to the first floor, where a police officer, an Iraqi plainclothes security guard and a young Libyan economist, Yusuf al-Azmarly, were shot dead.
As Carlos entered the conference room and fired shots into the ceiling, the delegates ducked under the table. The terrorists searched for Ahmed Zaki Yamani and then divided the sixty-three hostages into groups. Delegates of friendly countries were moved toward the door, 'neutrals' were placed in the centre of the room and the 'enemies' were placed along the back wall, next to a stack of explosives.
This last group included delegates from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Carlos demanded that a bus be provided to take his group and the hostages to the airport, where a DC-9 airplane and crew would be waiting. In the meantime, Carlos briefed Yamani on his plan to eventually fly to Aden, South Yemen where Yamani and Amuzegar would be killed. During the attack Hans-Joachim Klein was shot and injured; however, Carlos refused to leave him behind and demanded medical assistance. Kurdish-born doctor Wiriya Rawenduzy, who was living and working in Vienna, volunteered to accompany the terrorists on board in exchange for the hostages' safe release upon arrival.[7]
Carlos threatened the execution of a hostage every 15 minutes and demanded that the Austrian authorities read a communiqué about the Palestinian cause on Austrian radio and television networks every two hours. To avoid the executions, the Austrian government agreed and the communiqué was broadcast as requested. The communiqué was written in French and demanded that the Arab world wage a "total liberation war". As requested, a bus was provided the following morning at 6:40 and 42 hostages were boarded and taken to Vienna International Airport. The Viennese police said that 96 hostages were taken during the siege, though around 50 hostages resident in Vienna were freed.

Flight[edit]
An Austrian Airlines DC-9 was provided for the group and was airborne just after 9:00, with explosives placed under Yamani's seat. The plane first stopped in Algiers, where Carlos left the plane to meet with the Algerian Foreign minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Five oil ministers and 31 other hostages were released, while five oil ministers remained captive.
The refueled plane left for Tripoli, where there was trouble in acquiring another plane as had been planned. Carlos decided to instead return to Algiers and change to a Boeing 707, a plane large enough to fly to Baghdad nonstop. Ten more hostages were released before leaving.
With only ten hostages remaining, the Boeing 707 left for Algiers and arrived at 3:40 a.m.[clarification needed] After leaving the plane to meet with the Algerians, Carlos talked with his colleagues in the front cabin of the plane and then told Yamani and Amuzegar that they would be released at mid-day. Carlos was then called from the plane a second time and returned after two hours.
At this second meeting it is believed that Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in an attack on the plane. Yamani's biography[citation needed] suggests that the Algerians had used a covert listening device on the front of the aircraft to overhear the earlier conversation between the terrorists, and found that Carlos had in fact still planned to murder the two oil ministers. Boumédienne must also have offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment.
On returning to the plane, Carlos stood before Yamani and Amuzegar and expressed his regret at not being able to murder them. He then told the hostages that he and his comrades would leave the plane, after which they would all be free. After waiting for the terrorists to leave, Yamani and the other nine hostages followed and were taken to the airport by Algerian Foreign Minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The terrorists were present in the next lounge and Khalid, the Palestinian, asked to speak to Yamani. As his hand reached for his coat, Khalid was surrounded by guards and a gun was found concealed in a holster. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.

Aftermath[edit]
In the years following the OPEC raid, Carlos's accomplices revealed that the operation was commanded by Wadie Haddad, a founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. Fellow militants Bassam Abu Sharif and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20 million and US$50 million from "an Arab president". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution".[8][9] He was finally captured in 1994 in Khartoum, Sudan,  and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.[10]

In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
The 1997 film The Assignment depicts the OPEC siege early in the film.
The 2010 Olivier Assayas-directed series Carlos documented the life of Ramírez Sánchez. The film won a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Movie. Carlos was played by the Venezuelan actor Édgar Ramírez.

Computer addiction is a form of behavioral addiction[1] that can be described as the excessive or compulsive use of the computer, which persists despite serious negative consequences for personal, social, or occupational function.[2] Another clear conceptualization is made by Block, who stated that "Conceptually, the diagnosis is a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder that involves online and/or offline computer usage and consists of at least three subtypes: excessive gaming, sexual preoccupations, and e-mail/text messaging".[3] Computer addiction is not currently included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as an official disorder.[4] The concept of computer addiction is broadly divided into two types, namely offline computer addiction, and online computer addiction. Offline computer addiction is normally used when speaking about excessive gaming behavior, which can be practiced both offline and online.[5] Online computer addiction, also known as Internet addiction, gets more attention in general from scientific research than offline computer addiction, mainly because most cases of computer addiction are related to the excessive use of the Internet.[2]
Experts on Internet addiction have described this syndrome as an individual working intensely on the Internet, prolonged use of the Internet, uncontrollable use of the Internet, unable to use the Internet in an efficient, timely matter, not being interested in the outside world, not spending time with people from the outside world, and an increase in their loneliness and dejection.[6]


Symptoms[edit]
Being drawn by the computer as soon as one wakes up and before one goes to bed
Replacing old hobbies with excessive use of the computer and using the computer as one's primary source of entertainment and procrastination
Lacking physical exercise and/or outdoor exposure because of constant use of the computer, which could contribute to many health problems such as obesity
Backache
Headaches
Weight gain or loss
Disturbances in sleep
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Blurred or strained vision[7]
Depression and marital infidelity [8]
Effects[edit]
Excessive computer use may result in, or occur with:

Lack of face to face social interaction
Computer vision syndrome
Causes[edit]
Kimberly Young[9] indicates that previous research links internet/computer addiction with existing mental health issues, most notably depression. She states that computer addiction has significant effects socially, such as low self-esteem, psychologically and occupationally, which led many subjects to academic failure.
According to a Korean study on internet/computer addiction, pathological use of the internet results in negative life impacts such as job loss, marriage breakdown, financial debt, and academic failure. 70% of internet users in Korea are reported to play online games, 18% of whom are diagnosed as game addicts, which relates to internet/computer addiction. The authors of the article conducted a study using Kimberly Young's questionnaire. The study showed that the majority of those who met the requirements of internet/computer addiction experienced interpersonal difficulties and stress and that those addicted to online games specifically responded that they hoped to avoid reality.[10]

Types[edit]
Computers nowadays rely almost entirely on the internet, and thus relevant research articles relating to internet addiction may also be relevant to computer addiction.

Gaming addiction: a hypothetical behavioral addiction characterized by excessive or compulsive use of computer games or video games, which interferes with a person's everyday life.[11] Video game addiction may present itself as compulsive gaming, social isolation, mood swings, diminished imagination, and hyper-focus on in-game achievements, to the exclusion of other events in life.[12][13]
Social media addiction: Data suggest that participants use social media to fulfill their social needs but are typically dissatisfied.[14]  Lonely individuals are drawn to the Internet for emotional support. This could interfere with "real-life socializing" by reducing face-to-face relationships.[15] Some of these views are summed up in an Atlantic article by Stephen Marche entitled Is Facebook Making Us Lonely?, in which the author argues that social media provides more breadth, but not the depth of relationships that humans require and that users begin to find it difficult to distinguish between the meaningful relationships which we foster in the real world and the numerous casual relationships that are formed through social media.>[16]
Cyberstalking[edit]
According to Prof. Jordana N. Navarro et al. Cyberstalking is known as a behavior that includes but not limited to internet or technology use to stalk or harass an individual over time and in a menacing fashion.  Cyberstalking has been on the rise since the 1990s. These cryptic behaviors are also noticeable. Many of the cyberstalking cases are from people that do not know each other. Cyberstalkers are not limited to geographical boundaries, research has suggested various impulses in cyberstalking aside from excreting power and control over the target. Internet addiction and cyberstalking share several key traits that should lend support to new investigations to further scrutinize the relationship between the two disorders. Studies have shown that cyberstalkers can have different motives, but these results are not necessarily indicative of mental health issues. A cyberstalker is usually an emotionally damaged individual, a loner who seeks attention, gratification, and connection and in the process becomes infatuated with someone (Navarro et al. 2015)

Diagnostic Test[edit]
Many studies and surveys are being conducted to measure the extent of this type of addiction. Kimberly Young has created a questionnaire based on other disorders to assess the level of addiction. It is called the Internet Addict Diagnostic Questionnaire or IADQ. The questionnaire asks users about their online usage habits as well as their feelings about their internet usage. According to the IADQ sample, Internet Addiction resembles that of a Gambling disorder. Answering positively to five out of the eight questions on the IADQ may be indicative of online addiction.[17]
According to the article "Validating the Distinction between Computer Addiction and Engagement: Online Game Playing and Personality", the authors introduced a test to help identify the differences between addiction and engagement. Based on similar ideas, here are some ways to distinguish between computer engagement and addiction.[18]



Computer engagement:
Computer addiction:


I would not think about computers when I am doing other important things
I would ignore valued things because I am interested in my computer


I would not give up my work or school day because I want to spend more time on a computer
I would sometimes give up my friends or family gathering because I am interested in my computer


I would not think about the computer when I am not using it
I would not be able to focus on my work or study because I am interested in my computer


I would not be anxious if I were told to not use a computer
I would be anxious if I were told to not use a computer


I would succeed if I want to reduce the time that I spend on a computer
I would not succeed if I want to reduce the time that I spend on a computer


My schedule would not be affected by a computer
I often stay up at night because I want to spend more time on the computer


I don't think that I am addicted to computer
I think that I am addicted to computer

Origin of the term and history[edit]
Observations about the addictiveness of computers, and more specifically, computer games date back at least to the mid-1970s. Addiction and addictive behavior were common among the users of the PLATO system at the University of Illinois.[19] British e-learning academic Nicholas Rushby suggested in his 1979 book, An Introduction to Educational Computing, that people can be addicted to computers and experience withdrawal symptoms. The term was also used by M. Shotton in 1989 in her book Computer Addiction. However, Shotton concludes that the 'addicts' are not truly addicted. Dependency on computers, she argues, is better understood as a challenging and exciting pastime that can also lead to a professional career in the field. Computers do not turn gregarious, extroverted people into recluses; instead, they offer introverts a source of inspiration, excitement, and intellectual stimulation. Shotton's work seriously questions the legitimacy of the claim that computers cause addiction.
The term became more widespread with the explosive growth of the Internet, as well the availability of the personal computer.[20] Computers and the Internet both started to take shape as a personal and comfortable medium that could be used by anyone who wanted to make use of it. With that explosive growth of individuals making use of PCs and the Internet, the question started to arise whether or not misuse or excessive use of these new technologies could be possible as well. It was hypothesized that, like any technology aimed specifically at human consumption and use, abuse could have severe consequences for the individual in the short term and the society in the long term.[21]  In the late nineties people who made use of PCs and the internet were already referred to the term webaholics or cyberholics. Pratarelli et al. suggested at that point already to label "a cluster of behaviors potentially causing problems" as a computer or Internet addiction.[20]
There are other examples of computer overuse that date back to the earliest computer games. Press reports have furthermore noted that some Finnish Defence Forces conscripts were not mature enough to meet the demands of military life and were required to interrupt or postpone military service for a year. One reported source of the lack of needed social skills is an overuse of computer games or the Internet. Forbes termed this overuse "Web fixations", and stated that they were responsible for 12 such interruptions or deferrals over the 5 years from 2000 to 2005.[22]

1905–1914
Henry James Smith (December 29, 1883 – May 6, 1953) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played 98 games in various professional and amateur leagues, including the National Hockey Association and Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association. Among the teams he played with were the Cobalt Silver Kings, Toronto Tecumsehs, Ottawa Senators, and Montreal Wanderers. He was a member of the famous "Ottawa Silver Seven" from 1905 to 1907. His brothers Alf and Tommy also played ice hockey.[2]


Playing career[edit]
Harry Smith first played senior-level hockey with the Ottawa Aberdeens of the CAHL-Intermediate league in 1901. He played for Arnprior of the Upper Ottawa Valley Hockey League before joining Smiths Falls of the Southern Ontario Hockey Association. He played two seasons with Smiths Falls before returning home to play in Ottawa with the Ottawa Senators, already the Stanley Cup champion. He played two seasons with the Silver Seven with his brother Alf who was playing-coach. In the 1905–06 season, Alf, Harry and brother Tommy all played for the Silver Seven, occasionally playing together on one line.
Smith was known as a rough player. In 1907 Smith and teammates Alf Smith and Charles Spittal were charged with assault after beating Montreal Wanderers players Hod Stuart, Ernie "Moose" Johnson and Cecil Blachford with their sticks. Harry Smith was acquitted while Spittal and Alf Smith were each fined $20.[3] When Smith played in an exhibition game with the Winnipeg Maple Leafs against the Winnipeg Hockey Club on December 19, 1907, the Winnipeg Hockey Club players refused to carry on the contest after it had degenerated into a number of violent displays, the last of which involved blows between Harry Smith and Winnipeg Hockey Club defenseman Percy Browne.[4] He was subsequently expelled from the MHA along with Maple Leafs teammate Joe Hall.[5]
Smith was also known to have one of the better shots in the game during his era, which helped him score many goals.[6]

He became a professional player in 1907–08 with the Pittsburgh Bankers of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League (WPHL). On February 15, 1908, he was involved in a riot with spectators in a game against the Pittsburgh Athletic Club at the Duquesne Gardens where he went into the stands swinging his stick after he had been hit on the ice by a chair thrown by a spectator.[7] In 1908–09 he was a 'for hire' player playing for the Bankers,[8] Toronto Pros (OPHL), Haileybury Comets (TPHL) and Montreal Wanderers (ECHA), where he was member of the Wanderers 1909 Stanley Cup challenge championship squad, although the team did not hold the Cup at the end of the season.
In December 1909, prior to the 1909–10 season, Smith was badly scalded on one if his legs by the bursting of a valve in a steam engine while working for his father Henry in Fort William. He was laid up in hospital for several days, and it was first thought that he would not be able to play any hockey during the season, but he did play later on for both the Cobalt Silver Kings and the Haileybury Comets in the National Hockey Association.[9]
He moved on to the Waterloo Colts of the OPHL in 1911, the Schreiber Colts in 1912, before returning to the NHA with the Toronto Tecumsehs. He returned to Ottawa in 1913–14, playing two games with the Ottawa Hockey Club (now known as the Senators) before ending his career with the Halifax Crescents of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL).
He died at Ottawa in 1953.[6]

The government's nickname, the "Swedish coalition", refers to the flag of Sweden (pictured)
The Michel I Government was the Federal Government of Belgium formed following the 2014 Belgian government formation and sworn in on 11 October 2014. The administration was a centre-right coalition of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V), the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld) and the Reformist Movement (MR). The prime minister was Charles Michel. The government had an agenda of socio-economic reforms, especially through austerity measures, with its priorities being improving Belgium's economic competitiveness and reducing unemployment. It fell in December 2018 over the Global Compact for Migration.


Investiture and status in parliament[edit]
The government was sworn in on 11 October 2014, taking the oath of office before King Filip of Belgium. The four parties had a majority in the Chamber of Representatives with 85 members out of 150. On 16 October 2014, the motion of confidence from the Chamber of Representatives was approved by a vote of 84 in favour, 58 against and one abstention (by Aldo Carcaci, the People's Party MP).[1]
The government's number of seats was reduced to 83 when two N-VA members, Hendrik Vuye and Veerle Wouters, left the party in September 2016.

Coalition[edit]
The government consists of a centre-right coalition of the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA), Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&V), the Open Flemish Liberals and Democrats (Open Vld) and the Reformist Movement (MR). It is nicknamed "Swedish coalition" inasmuch as the party colours yellow (N-VA) and blue (liberal, i.e. MR and Open Vld) and the cross (Christianity, i.e. CD&V) are combined on the Swedish flag. Initially (given doubts about its durability) the government was also called a "kamikaze coalition", inasmuch as the MR is the only French-speaking party in the coalition.
For the first time in 25 years, the French-speaking Socialist Party did not become a part of the federal government, whereas the Flemish nationalist N-VA helped form a government for the first time. Initially no French-speaking party wanted to partner with the N-VA, but in negotiations MR agreed to do so on the condition that the government's focus would be on socio-economic issues and that no "community-related" issues (as arise in the complex Belgian federal system) or constitutional reform plans would be part of the cabinet programme.

Policies and events[edit]
Despite three parties (all but N-VA) having been part of the preceding Di Rupo Government as well, the programme of this coalition differs substantially from the previous one. The emphasis is on socio-economic reforms, especially through austerity measures. Important goals for the parties include helping businesses become more competitive, and increasing job growth.
The announced measures were met by protests primarily from the labour unions, which argued that the measures favour employers and disproportionately burden employees and families. The unions, ACV/CSC, ABVV/FGTB and ACLVB/CGSLB, which play an important and institutionalised role in Belgium's political process, did not accept the government's offer for dialogue, maintaining that the government was not seriously inclined to reconsider any of the measures. Instead, the unions organised several regional and national strikes in November and December 2014, culminating in a one-day general strike on 15 December.[2]
One of the federal executive's flagship measures was tax reform, or tax shift , aimed, among other things, at reducing the cost of labour. It took effect on 1 January 2016.[3][4][5]
Following the 22 March 2016 attacks in Brussels, Interior Minister Jan Jambon and Justice Minister Koen Geens submitted their resignations. They were refused by the Prime Minister.[6]
Another reform of the executive consists of increasing the age of retirement. It will thus increase from 65 to 66 in 2025 and from 66 to 67 in 2030 in order to finance the future cost of pensions. This measure, strongly criticized by the unions, provoked numerous strikes and demonstrations.[7]
An often recurring subject was whether or not a capital gains tax should be introduced, together with a general tax reform. In the summer of 2017, the corporate gains tax was announced to be reduced from 33.99% to 29% starting 2018 and further down to 25% from 2020 whereas a capital gains tax of 0.15% on gains on financial securities was introduced for wealthier citizens holding accounts of at least 0.5 million Eur in value. Meanwhile the first 627 Eur of income through dividends became tax exempt.
Other measures taken by the government include the purchase of F-35s to replace the Belgian army's F-16s, the abandonment of nuclear power by 2025, the removal of abortion from the penal code and the launch of a public investment pact in cooperation with the private sector.[8][9]
The government presided over the arrest of suspects who were accused of playing a role in the Paris attacks of November 2015, as well as a terrorist attack in Brussels in March 2016.
In December 2018, a political crisis emerged over whether to sign the Global Compact for Migration; N-VA was against whereas the other three parties supported it. On 4 December the Prime Minister of Belgium, Charles Michel, announced that the issue would be taken to parliament for a vote.[10] On 5 December, parliament voted 106 to 36 in favor of backing the agreement.[11] Michel stated that he would endorse the pact on behalf of the parliament, not on behalf of the divided government.[12] Consequently, N-VA quit the government; the other three parties continue as a minority government (Michel II).
On 18 December 2018, Michel submitted the cabinet's resignation to the King, who accepted it on 21 December.[13]

Composition[edit]
The Constitution requires an equal number of Dutch- and French-speaking ministers (regardless of the Prime Minister). Since MR is the only French-speaking party, it has more ministers than it would otherwise get with its electoral weight; this is compensated by having only Dutch-speaking Secretaries of State.

Changes in composition[edit]
On 21 May 2015 the portfolios Urban Policy and fighting Fiscal Fraud were re-allocated between three N-VA members. Urban Policy moved from Jan Jambon to Elke Sleurs, while Sleurs handed over Fiscal Fraud to Johan Van Overtveldt.[14]
On 21 September 2015 it was announced that minister of Budget Hervé Jamar (MR) would resign to become governor of Liège. He was succeeded by Sophie Wilmès (MR).[15]
On 25 March 2016, in the aftermath of the March 2016 terrorist attacks in Brussels, Interior Minister Jan Jambon and Justice Minister Koen Geens both offered their resignation over their failure to detain one of the suspects, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, despite warnings from Turkey's government in 2015. Michel rejected both resignations and the government's composition remained unchanged.[16]
On 15 April 2016, in the aftermath of the March 2016 terrorist attacks in Brussels, minister of mobility Jacqueline Galant (MR) resigned, after it became known that prior to the attacks she had received a summary of a damning European Commission report (2015) on security at Belgian airports.[17][18] Two days later she was replaced by François Bellot.[19][20]
On 29 April 2016, Bart Tommelein (Open Vld) left his position as Secretary of State for Social fraud, Privacy and the North Sea to replace Annemie Turtelboom who had resigned earlier that same day as Flemish Minister for Finance, Budget and Energy in the Flemish Government. While Tommelein was replacing Turtelboom, he was himself replaced by Philippe De Backer who gave up his position as Member of the European Parliament.[21]
On 20 February 2017, Elke Sleurs (N-VA) announced she would leave her position as Secretary of State for Equal Rights, Disabled Persons, Scientific Policy, Urban Policy and fighting Poverty to become lijsttrekker in Ghent for the upcoming 2018 municipal elections.[22] Three days later, the N-VA decided to replace Sleurs with Zuhal Demir. Demir was sworn in by the King on 24 February 2017.[23]
On 26 July 2017, Willy Borsus (MR) was appointed Minister-President of the Walloon Government, leaving his position as Minister of the Middle Class, SMEs, Self-employed and Agriculture, which was taken by Denis Ducarme.[24]
Following the Belgian local elections of October 2018, Minister of Defence Steven Vandeput was elected Mayor of Hasselt, a position he will be taking up as from 1 January 2019. Vandeput will therefore vacate his position in the federal government and on 2 November 2018, the N-VA nominated Sander Loones as his successor, with Loones already taking up the position on 12 November 2018.[25]
On 9 December 2018, King Philippe approved the resignation of 5 N-VA members of cabinet: three ministers, Jan Jambon, Johan Van Overtveldt and Sander Loones, and two state secretaries, Theo Francken and Zuhal Demir. Secretaries of state Pieter De Crem (CD&V) and Philippe De Backer (Open Vld) were appointed as ministers.[26] The following portfolios were reattributed: Asylum and Migration to Maggie De Block, Interior to Pieter De Crem, Finance to Alexander De Croo, Telecommunications, Postal Services, Administrative Simplification and Digital Agenda to Philippe De Backer, Defence to Didier Reynders, Equal Rights, Disabled Persons and fighting Poverty to Kris Peeters, Scientific Policy and Civil Service to Sophie Wilmès, and Urban Policy to Denis Ducarme.[27]

Posthumous nameEmperor Wu (武皇帝)Temple nameGaozu (高祖)HouseYuwenDynastyNorthern ZhouFatherYuwen TaiMotherEmpress Xuan
Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou ((北)周武帝) (543 – 21 June 578[1]), personal name Yuwen Yong (宇文邕), Xianbei name Miluotu (禰羅突), was an emperor of the Xianbei-led Northern Zhou dynasty of China. As was the case of the reigns of his brothers Emperor Xiaomin and Emperor Ming, the early part of his reign was dominated by his cousin Yuwen Hu, but in 572 he ambushed Yuwen Hu and seized power personally. He thereafter ruled ably and built up the power of his military, destroying the rivaling Northern Qi dynasty in 577 and annexing its territory. His death the next year, however, ended his ambitions of uniting China, and under the reign of his erratic son Emperor Xuan (Yuwen Yun), Northern Zhou itself soon deteriorated and was usurped by Yang Jian, who founded the Sui dynasty, in 581.


Background[edit]
Yuwen Yong was born in 543, as the fourth son of the Western Wei paramount general Yuwen Tai. His mother was Yuwen Tai's concubine Lady Chinu. He was born at Yuwen Tai's then-headquarters at Tong Province (同州, roughly modern Weinan, Shaanxi). He was considered filially pious, respectful, and intelligent in his youth. During six years his father entrusted him and his brother to general Li Xian for his protection and education, as the court had become too dangerous.[2] In 554, Emperor Fei of Western Wei created him the Duke of Fucheng.
Yuwen Tai died in 556, and in spring 557, Yuwen Yong's cousin Yuwen Hu, entrusted with the governing authority by Yuwen Tai, forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Yong's older brother Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou. Yuwen Jue took the throne as Emperor Xiaomin, but used the alternative title of "Heavenly Prince" (Tian Wang). Yuwen Hu served as regent, and later that year, when Emperor Xiaomin tried to seize power from him, Yuwen Hu deposed Emperor Xiaomin and then killed him, replacing him with another older brother of Yuwen Yong's, Yuwen Yu, who took the throne as Emperor Ming. Emperor Ming created Yuwen Yong the greater title of Duke of Lu and often consulted Yuwen Yong on important matters. Although Yuwen Yong did not speak much, Emperor Ming made the observation, "He did not often speak, but whatever he spoke was always right."
In 559, Yuwen Hu formally returned his authorities to Emperor Ming, and Emperor Ming began to formally rule on governmental matters, but Yuwen Hu retained the command of the military. In 560, Yuwen Hu, apprehensive of Emperor Ming's abilities, had the imperial chef Li An (李安) poison him with sugar cookies. Emperor Ming, realizing that he was near death, designated Yuwen Yong as his successor, and after he soon died, Yuwen Yong took the throne as Emperor Wu. However, the control of the government again fell into Yuwen Hu's hands.

DNA analysis[edit]
A 2024 genetic study analyzed the genetic makeup of Emperor Wu, determining him to be of primarily Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry (c. 62%), with lower amounts of 'Yellow River farmers' ancestry associated with Han Chinese (c. 32%). The remaining 6% was derived from Western Steppe Herders. It was furthermore revealed that he might have died of a stroke, as he carried several risk-alleles. The study's authors also could reconstruct how he looked like, determining him to have had "a typical East or Northeast Asian facial appearance". A previous study on his wife, Empress Ashina of the early Turkic ruling class, the Ashina tribe, determined her to be of nearly entirely Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry.[3]
His face was reconstructed in 2024 using the DNA analysis, CNN posted his reconstructed face. 

Early reign[edit]
Emperor Wu was said to be largely a silent emperor early in his reign, giving Yuwen Hu free rein over the government, although he appeared to start cultivating a group of officials who would be loyal to him as the years went by. He formally bestowed Yuwen Hu with not only the military authorities, but also authority over all six ministries.
With the Liang Dynasty general Wang Lin and the throne claimant that he supported, Xiao Zhuang, having been defeated by Chen Dynasty in spring 560 and having fled to Northern Qi, Northern Zhou (and its vassal Western Liang, with Emperor Xuan of Western Liang as its emperor) contended for control of Xiao Zhuang's former territory with Chen, precipitating a confrontation. Starting in winter 560, the Northern Zhou generals Heruo Dun (賀若敦) and Dugu Sheng (獨孤盛) began a drawn-out stalemate with the Chen general Hou Tian (侯瑱), initially being successful in thwarting Hou's attacks. Around the new year 561, however, Dugu was forced to withdraw, and Heruo was isolated. In spring 561, Hou agreed to let Heruo withdraw if Heruo would yield, and so Heruo withdrew; the modern Hunan region thus became Chen territory. (Yuwen Hu, believing Heruo to be at fault for losing the region, removed him from his posts.)
Also in 561, Emperor Wu honored his mother Lady Chinu empress dowager.
In spring 562, to foster a peaceful relationship with Chen, Northern Zhou returned the brother of Emperor Wen of Chen, Chen Xu, as well as Chen Xu's wife Liu Jingyan and son Chen Shubao, to Chen. In exchange, Chen gave the city of Lushan (魯山, in modern Wuhan, Hubei) to Northern Zhou.
In summer 562, Emperor Wu, seeing that previously, nobles were not receiving any material benefits from their titles, began to have the nobles receive stipends based on the size of their fiefs.
In spring 563, while on a visit to Yuan Province (原州, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), Emperor Wu suddenly returned to the capital Chang'an without explanation. One of his attendants, Houmochen Chong (侯莫陳崇) the Duke of Liang, speculated to his associates that Yuwen Hu had died. When Houmochen's speculations became known, Emperor Wu publicly rebuked Houmochen, and the same night, Yuwen Hu sent troops to surround Houmochen's mansion, forcing him to commit suicide. Soon thereafter, he publicly bestowed Yuwen Hu the honor of having his name be subject to naming taboo, an honor that Yuwen Hu declined.
Also in spring 563, Emperor Wu promulgated a new 25-volume criminal code drafted by the official Tuoba Di (拓拔迪), which divided the criminal punishment into 25 classes.
In fall 563, Northern Zhou entered into an alliance treaty with the Gokturks, known to the Chinese as Tujue, against Northern Qi, part of which involved a promise that Emperor Wu would marry the daughter of Ashina Qijin, Tujue's Mugan Khan. In winter 563, the joint forces of Northern Zhou and Tujue launched a two-prong attack on Northern Qi, with the northern prong attacking Northern Qi's secondary capital Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and the southern prong attacking Pingyang (平陽, in modern Linfen, Shanxi). The northern prong, commanded by the general Yang Zhong (楊忠), put Jinyang under siege, but was soon defeated by the Northern Qi general Duan Shao (段韶) and forced to withdraw. In response, the southern prong, commanded by Daxi Wu (達奚武), also withdrew. Still, the attack demonstrated the growing Northern Zhou strength—as previously, in the winter months, Northern Zhou forces would break the ice on the Yellow River to prevent possible Northern Qi attacks, but around this time and thereafter, Northern Qi forces broke the ice on the river to prevent possible Northern Zhou attacks.
In fall 564, in order to placate Yuwen Hu, Emperor Wucheng of Northern Qi returned Yuwen Hu's mother Lady Yan and his (and Emperor Wu's) aunt (Yuwen Tai's sister), who had been trapped in Northern Qi territory several decades earlier, to Northern Zhou. In order to celebrate Lady Yan's return, Emperor Wu issued a general pardon, and prostrated himself before her as an ordinary nephew would. In turn, Yuwen Hu considered calling off planned joint attacks with Tujue against Northern Qi, but was fearful that Tujue would believe that Northern Zhou was abandoning the alliance, and therefore launched another joint attack with Tujue in winter 564. The assault, the main brunt of which was against Luoyang, however, was unsuccessful, and soon was abandoned.
In spring 565, Emperor Wu sent his brother Yuwen Chun (宇文純) the Duke of Chen, Yuwen Gui (宇文貴) the Duke of Xu, Dou Yi (竇毅) the Duke of Shenwu, and Yang Jian (楊薦, different person than the more-known Yang Jian, referenced above and below) the Duke of Nanyang, to lead a ceremonial guard corps to Tujue to welcome back Ashina Qijin's daughter for marriage to him. However, when they arrived at Ashina Qijin's headquarters, he turned against the treaty and detained Yuwen Chun and his attendants.

Middle reign[edit]
In 566, the non-Chinese tribes of Xin Province (信州, modern eastern Chongqing) rebelled and captured Baidicheng, under the leadership of the chieftains Ran Lingxian (冉令賢) and Xiang Wuziwang (向五子王). The general Lu Teng (陸騰), however, was able to persuade some of Rang's subjects to turn against him, and he subsequently defeated Rang and Xiang, killing them and suppressing the revolts.
In 567, in light of the death of Chen's Emperor Wen and succession by his son Emperor Fei of Chen in 566, the high level Chen officials engaged in infighting, and Emperor Wen's brother Chen Xu was victorious. The general Hua Jiao (華皎), the governor of Xiang Province (roughly modern Changsha, Hunan), felt uneasy, and therefore sought aid from Northern Zhou and Western Liang. Yuwen Hu, over the opposition by the official Cui You (崔猷), sent an army commanded by Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Zhi (宇文直) the Duke of Wei to assist Hua and Western Liang, which was also aiding Hua. The Chen general Wu Mingche, however, quickly defeated the joint forces of Northern Zhou, Western Liang, and Hua, forcing Hua and Yuwen Zhi to both give up the war and flee to the Western Liang capital Jiangling. Chen was able to retain all of Hua's territory and further make minor territorial gains against both Northern Zhou and Western Liang as well. Yuwen Hu relieved Yuwen Zhi from his posts, and while Yuwen Zhi was eventually restored to them, Yuwen Zhi, who had previously had a cordial relationship with Yuwen Hu, bore a grudge against Yuwen Hu and secretly encouraged Emperor Wu to act against Yuwen Hu.
In spring 568, a major storm at Tujue's headquarters inflicted substantial damage, and Ashina Qijin took it as a sign of divine displeasure at his rescission of the marriage agreement with Northern Zhou. He therefore returned Yuwen Chun, along with the daughter he promised Emperor Wu, back to Northern Zhou.  Emperor Wu personally welcomed her and created her empress.
Perhaps in light of the new adversarial relationship with Chen, when Northern Qi made peace overtures in fall 568, Northern Zhou accepted, and there was peace between the states for about a year, until fall 569, when Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Prince of Qi led an army to siege Northern Qi's city of Yiyang (宜陽, in modern Luoyang, Henan) -- and for more than a year, the two states would engage in struggle for the control of Yiyang. Meanwhile, in fall 570, the Chen general Zhang Zhaoda (章昭達) put siege to Jiangling, nearly capturing it, but was eventually fought off by Northern Zhou and Western Liang's joint forces.
In 569-570, Emperor Wu organized a debate between Buddhists and Daoists and commissioned two reports - the Xiaodao Lun and the Erjiao Lun - on the suitability of either religion for their adoption by the Chinese government.[4] He came out with a more favorable impression of Daoism, and would found the Tongdao Guan (通道观) for Daoist research, which would eventually compile the first Daoist encyclopedia, the Wushang Biyao (无上秘要).[4][5]
In winter 570—as forewarned by the Northern Zhou general Wei Xiaokuan, who advised against the Yiyang campaign—the famed Northern Qi general Hulü Guang left Yiyang and instead advanced onto Northern Zhou territory north of the Fen River (汾水, flowing through modern Linfen), building forts and capturing substantial territory from Northern Zhou. While a counterattack by Yuwen Xian subsequently fought Hulü to a stalemate, damage had been done, and Northern Zhou was further forced to give up on the Yiyang campaign in fall 571 to concentrate against Hulü.
Also in 571, Hua went to Chang'an, and on the way, he met Yuwen Zhi at Xiang Province (襄州, roughly modern Xiangfan, Hubei), suggesting to Yuwen Zhi that Western Liang was in such a desperate shape that if Northern Zhou wanted to see it preserved, Northern Zhou should lend some land to Western Liang. Yuwen Zhi agreed and made the proposal to Emperor Wu; in response, Emperor Wu gave three provinces—Ji (基州), Ping (平州), and Ruo (鄀州) (together making up about modern Jingmen and Yichang, Hubei) to Western Liang.
By 572, Yuwen Hu had controlled the military for 16 years and the government for nearly as long. Emperor Wu had long wanted him out of the way, although he showed few outward signs of it. He conspired with Yuwen Zhi, distant relatives Yuwen Shenju (宇文神舉) and Yuwen Xiaobo (宇文孝伯), and Wang Gui (王軌) against Yuwen Hu. In spring 572, he made his move. After Emperor Wu and Yuwen Hu had a meeting, he invited Yuwen Hu into the palace to meet with Empress Dowager Chinu. On the way to her palace, he told Yuwen Hu that Empress Dowager Chinu was having problem with alcoholism and not listening to his advice to stop her drinking, so he wanted Yuwen Hu to advise her to change her ways as well. He further gave Yuwen Hu the text of the Jiu Gao (酒誥) -- an anti-alcoholism declaration written by King Cheng of Zhou—and suggested that he read the Jiu Gao to Empress Dowager Chinu. Once they reached her palace, Yuwen Hu, pursuant to Emperor Wu's request, started reading the Jiu Gao. Before he could finish it, Emperor Wu stepped behind him and used a jade tablet to strike the back of his head. Yuwen Hu fell to the ground, and Yuwen Zhi, who was hiding nearby, jumped out, and cut off Yuwen Hu's head, ending Yuwen Hu's hold on power. Yuwen Hu's sons, brothers, and key associates were all executed.

Late reign[edit]
The epitaph of Emperor Wu's mausoleum. It reads: "The Xiao Mausoleum of Great Zhou ancestor Emperor Wu" (“大周高祖武皇帝孝陵”)
Having been instrumental in Yuwen Hu's death, Yuwen Zhi sought to take over Yuwen Hu's post, but Emperor Wu, who wanted to directly control the government, divided the authority between several officials, retaining most authorities in himself. He took the opportunity posthumously to honor his brother Emperor Xiaomin (Yuwen Hu had refused to do so previously) and create his son Yuwen Yun the Duke of Lu crown prince. He also began to oppose overt luxury and destroyed several palaces that he found overly luxurious as well as other items that he considered ornately decorated.
Also in summer 572, Emperor Wu learned that Northern Qi's emperor Gao Wei, apprehensive of Hulü Guang, had executed Hulü. Being glad, Emperor Wu declared a general pardon.
By 573, it had come to Emperor Wu's attention that Crown Prince Yun was not paying attention to matters of state but instead associated with immoral people. In response, Emperor Wu selected staff members for Crown Prince Yun who were known for their strict conduct. This made the crown prince unhappy.
Around the new year 574, Emperor Wu gathered Confucian scholars, Taoist monks, and Buddhist monks, and had them debate about their philosophies. He ranked Confucianism the highest, then Taoism, and then Buddhism. Subsequently, in summer 574, he banned both Taoism and Buddhism, ordering their monks to return to secular life. He also banned the worship of minor deities whose cults were not registered with the government. (This became known as the second of the Three Disasters of Wu)
In spring 574, Empress Dowager Chinu died. Emperor Wu mourned for more than a month, eating only a small amount of rice during this period.
In fall 574, while Emperor Wu was at Yunyang (雲陽, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Yuwen Zhi, who had long resented not receiving more authority, rebelled at Chang'an. The official Yuchi Yun (尉遲運), one of the officials in charge of the capital along with Crown Prince Yun, defeated Yuwen Zhi, forcing him to flee. Yuwen Zhi was soon captured and executed.
Believing Northern Qi to have been substantially weakened not only by Hulü's death but also by the successful campaign that Chen waged against it in 573 (capturing the provinces between the Yangtze River and the Huai River), by 575, Emperor Wu was seriously considering a major campaign against Northern Qi. However, he kept the matter secret, consulting only Yuwen Xian, Wang Yi (王誼), and Yu Yi (于翼). Only until he was ready in fall 575 did he announce it generally. He aimed his attack at Luoyang, but he spent about 20 days sieging it and could not capture it, and became ill.  He withdrew, with virtually no gain.
In spring 576, pursuant to Emperor Wu's orders, Crown Prince Yun launched a campaign against Tuyuhun; a campaign that appeared to be moderately successful. Yet the campaign would bring another deterioration of the relationship between father and son, as Wang Gui, who officially served as the crown prince's lieutenant (along with Yuwen Xiaobo) but was in charge of the operation, reported a matter of immoral acts that the crown prince and his associates Zheng Yi (鄭譯) and Wang Duan (王端) engaged in. Emperor Wu himself caned the crown prince and his associates, expelling the associates from the crown prince's palace. (Crown Prince Yun, however, soon recalled his associates.) Emperor Wu was also exceedingly strict with Crown Prince Yun, disallowing him from resting or drinking. Whenever he had faults, Emperor Wu would batter him or whip him, and further warn him that he would be deposed. Emperor Wu further ordered the crown prince's staff to report all of his actions to the emperor. Fearful of his father, Crown Prince Yun learned to feign upright behavior, and the emperor thought that the crown prince had changed.
In winter 576, Emperor Wu again attacked Northern Qi; this time, changing strategy and attacking Pingyang instead. He was able to capture Pingyang quickly, before Northern Qi troops could arrive. The Northern Qi emperor Gao Wei soon advanced toward Pingyang with a large army, and Emperor Wu, not wanting to engage Gao Wei's army directly, withdrew, leaving the general Liang Shiyan (梁士彥) in charge of defending Pingyang. Gao Wei put Pingyang under siege, and at one point nearly captured it. Emperor Wu, after reorganizing his forces, relaunched his army and headed for Pingyang, seeking to lift the siege. Around the new year 577, he arrived near Pingyang and Gao Wei chose to engage him—but, once the battle began, panicked when his favorite concubine Consort Feng Xiaolian falsely believed that the army had been defeated—and he abandoned the army, causing its collapse. Gao Wei fled to Jinyang, and Emperor Wu gave chase. No longer having the will to fight Emperor Wu, Gao Wei further fled back to the Northern Qi capital Yecheng, leaving his cousin Gao Yanzong in charge of Jinyang. Gao Yanzong launched a counterattack, catching Emperor Wu by surprise and nearly killing him. However, after the victory, Gao Yanzong's army went into a celebration, and he was unable to reorganize it, and Emperor Wu soon defeated and captured him, and headed for Yecheng.
Gao Wei, after passing the throne to his young son Gao Heng to deflect ill omens, considered resisting, but instead decided to flee southeast across the Yellow River, planning to regroup and see if he could make a last stand—but if not, to flee to Chen. In spring 577, Emperor Wu entered Yecheng. With Gao Wei's official Gao Anagong feeding him intelligence on Gao Wei's location, he was able to capture Gao Wei.  After Gao Wei was returned to Yecheng, he treated Gao Wei with respect and created Gao Wei the Duke of Wen. Gao Wei's uncle Gao Jie (高湝) and cousin Gao Xiaoheng (高孝珩), making one last stand at Xindu (信都, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), were also soon defeated and captured. Another of Gao Wei's cousins, Gao Shaoyi, after making a failed bid to resist, fled to Tujue and came under the protection of Ashin Qijin's successor Tuobo Khan. Other than Ying Province (營州, roughly modern Zhaoyang, Liaoning), held by the official Gao Baoning (高寶寧), a distant relative to Northern Qi's imperial Gao clan, all of Northern Qi's territory came under Northern Zhou rule.

In summer 577, Emperor Wu returned to Chang'an with Gao Wei and other members of the Gao clan in tow. In winter 577, apprehensive of the Gao clan members, he falsely accused Gao Wei of conspiring with the former Northern Qi official Mu Tipo and killed Mu and ordered Gao Wei and the other members of the Gao clan to commit suicide.
In light of Northern Qi's defeat, Chen, then ruled by Chen Xu (who had deposed Emperor Fei and took the throne himself as Emperor Xuan), launched an attack commanded by Wu Mingche on Pengcheng (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), an important city on the former Chen/Northern Qi border. Emperor Wu sent Wang Gui to relieve Pengcheng, and in spring 578, Wang defeated Wu, capturing him.
By summer 578, Emperor Wu was engaging in military campaigns on two fronts: against Tujue in the north and against Chen in the south. However, he suddenly grew ill and, after stopping at Yunyang, ended the attack against Tujue. He entrusted the important matters to Yuwen Xiaobo, and he soon died at the age of 35. Crown Prince Yun succeeded him (as Emperor Xuan), and by 581 Northern Zhou had fallen, its throne having been seized by Emperor Xuan's father-in-law Yang Jian.

Mausoleum[edit]
Emperor Wu was buried at the Northern Zhou Qiaoling Mausoleum, together with his Turkic wife, Empress Ashina.[6][7]
A recent study on the remains of Emperor Wu (his skull was nearly completely preserved), has shown that "Emperor Wu had typical East or Northeast Asian facial characteristics", which bring some light on the appearance of the people of Xianbei ancestry, to whom Emperor Wu belonged, in the 6th century CE.[8][9]

Relation with xiangqi[edit]
Yuwen Yong was a great fan of xiangqi, he wrote a book about it, Xiang Jing, in 569 AD.

Operation Chromite (Korean: 인천상륙작전; Hanja: 仁川上陸作戰; RR: Incheon Sangnyuk Jakjeon; lit. Operation Inchon Landing) or Battle for Incheon: Operation Chromite in US, is a 2016 South Korean spy war film
co-written and directed by John H. Lee. It is a fiction based on a true story of Operation X-ray [ko] by ROK Navy Intelligence Unit and Operation Trudy Jackson [ko] by US Military Intelligence Unit (including KLO and CIA), depicts espionages which took charge for preparatory stage of Operation Chromite (Incheon Landing Operation, Battle of Inchon) in Korean War.[4][5][6]
Produced by Taewon Entertainment [ko], presented by Finecut. In South Korea, released July 27, 2016 which the date concluded the armistice agreement of Korean War, distributed by CJ Entertainment.[7]


Plot[edit]
In 1950, just a few months after North Korean forces have overrun most of South Korea, an American-led UN coalition is deployed to Korea to aid the struggling South Koreans. General Douglas MacArthur devises a secret plan to attack behind enemy lines at the port city of Incheon. The risky strategy is opposed by leaders of the other military branches, forcing MacArthur to devise a clandestine operation to gather essential information from within occupied Incheon by coordinating a weeklong South Korean intelligence operation known as "X-ray".
The linchpin of this top-secret incursion, Captain Jang Hak-Soo of the ROK Navy Intelligence Unit (a former Korean People's Army officer who defected to South Korea after seeing his father executed in front of him by his fellow communist officers), and seven members of the X-Ray unit disguise themselves as a Korean People's Army inspection unit and infiltrate the North Korean command center in Incheon, coordinated by the Soviet-trained commander Lim Gye-Jin, a protégé of Kim Il Sung. Their prime objective is to determine the placement of North Korean defenses (such as mines and artillery) and the tactical characteristics of the Incheon harbor (notorious for swift currents and major tidal surges), and secure a lighthouse crucial to the landing's success.
Immediately suspicious of Jang's "inspection mission", Lim attempts to impede his comrade's investigation and orders his staff to monitor the new arrivals closely. The U.S. command relays MacArthur's orders to obtain navigation charts showing naval mine placements in the harbor and prepare a strategy to assist the coalition forces with landing an amphibious assault in a narrow two-hour window between tides. When contacts within the South Korean military intelligence unit known as KLO (Korea Liaison Office, predecessor to present-day South Korean Headquarters of Intelligence Detachment, or HID) warn Jang that time is running out to successfully complete the mission, he pushes his group to extremes. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, MacArthur prepares Operation Chromite, an invasion force of 75,000 UN troops and over 200 warships, to imminently depart for the Korean Peninsula.[8]

State Route 263 (SR 263, also known as Devils Canyon Road) is a 9.24-mile (14.87 km) long state highway in the U.S. state of Washington, serving rural Franklin County and the Lower Monumental Dam. The highway begins at the Port of Windust on the Snake River and travels east to the Lower Monumental Dam and north to SR 260 in Kahlotus, paralleling the Columbia Plateau Trail. Devils Canyon carried traffic on the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway in the early 20th century before the completion of a road serving the Lower Monumental Dam in 1961. The Devils Canyon Road was paved and signed as SR 263 in 1991 and the railroad became the Columbia Plateau Trail the same year.


Route description[edit]
Aerial view of the Lower Monumental Dam, served by SR 263, on the Snake River
SR 263 begins at the Port of Windust along the northern shores of the Snake River in rural Franklin County. The highway travels east past Windust Park along hills to the northwest and the riverbank on the southeast banks, part of Burr Canyon. At the Lower Monumental Dam, the roadway turns north into the narrow Devils Canyon and follows the Columbia Plateau Trail.[3] The highway enters Kahlotus and becomes Spokane Street before ending at SR 260.[4]
Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 70 and 290 vehicles per day used the highway, a decrease from previous years.[5]

History[edit]
Devils Canyon was originally home to the Portland–Spokane line of the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, completed in 1908 with a small tunnel near the north bank of the Snake River.[6][7][8] The United States Army Corps of Engineers built an improved Devils Canyon Road to connect Kahlotus to a grain facility owned by the newly established Port of Kahlotus in 1961.[9][10] The Lower Monumental Dam on the Snake River was completed in February 1969 and opened in May of the same year at the south end of Devils Canyon.[11][12] The rail line fell into disuse by 1987 and the right-of-way was acquired by the Washington State Park System in 1991 to become the Columbia Plateau Trail.[13]
A state legislative committee received proposals to add the Windust–Kahlotus road to the state highway system in 1986.[14] The road was designated as State Route 263 (SR 263) in 1991 and signed into law on April 1, 1992 to serve the Port of Kahlotus, now the Port of Windust, and connect to the existing SR 260 in Kahlotus.[2] No major revisions have occurred since the signing of the highway in 1961,[15] however a landslide in July 2012 closed the highway for two days as Washington State Department of Transportation crews cleared up to 4,500 cubic yards (3,440 m3) of debris and repaired damaged asphalt.[16][17]

Major intersections[edit]
The entire highway is in Franklin County.

John Jay Hall is a 15-story building located on the southeastern extremity of the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University in New York City, on the northwestern corner of 114th St. and Amsterdam Avenue. Named for Founding Father, The Federalist Papers author, diplomat, and first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Jay (Class of 1764), it was among the last buildings designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, which had provided Columbia's original Morningside Heights campus plan, and was finished in 1927.
The building includes freshman housing for students of Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science; John Jay Dining Hall, the university's primary undergraduate dining facility; JJ's Place, an underground student quick service restaurant; the university's health services center; and an elegant wood-paneled lounge. Among its most prominent residents was the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca.
Unlike Carman Hall, the other exclusively freshman dormitory at Columbia, in which rooms are double-occupancy and arranged in clusters of two around a common bathroom as a suite, John Jay Hall's accommodations consist primarily of single rooms along narrow corridors, generally with three double-occupancy rooms per floor. Other dormitories housing undergraduate freshmen (but not exclusively so) include Wallach Hall, Hartley Hall, and Furnald Hall.


History[edit]
"Skyscraper Dorm"[edit]
The John Jay lobby in 1927
Following the First World War, significantly expanded enrollment at Columbia, combined with skyrocketing rents in Morningside Heights, prompted the construction of new dormitories at Columbia. Such a pressing need required a substantial expansion in housing space, and John Jay, the newest building for Columbia students, was built to nearly double the height of preexisting dormitories.[1]
John Jay Hall was notably distinct from its institutional contemporaries on Morningside Heights. Johnson (now Wien) and Hewitt Halls were built to house female Columbia graduate students and Barnard College undergraduates, respectively. Both employed lighter wood finishing and "early-American" neo-colonial architecture, thought to reflect the comfortable, domestic environment women ought to be exposed to. In contrast, John Jay Hall featured dark wooden ceiling beams and panelling, as well as other details thought to render it a more "masculine" structure.[1]
In his 1919 annual report, University President Nicholas Murray Butler wrote that the new dorm would "make provision for student life and student organizations which are so important a part of the total educational influence that the university, and particularly the College, exerts." Originally known simply as Students Hall, the building therefore incorporated features, such as the dining hall and rathskeller (the Lion's Den Grill, now JJ's Place), as well as student club space on the fourth floor, meant to foster on-campus student life. It rapidly became the center of undergraduate life, housing the offices of campus publications such as the Jester and the Columbia Daily Spectator. As humanist writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton wrote of his Columbia experiences in The Seven Storey Mountain, "The fourth floor of John Jay Hall was the place where all the offices of the student publications, the Glee Club and the Student Board and all the rest were to be found. It was the noisiest and most agitated part of campus."[2] John Jay also came to house dances, alumni receptions, and the holiday Yule Log lighting ceremony.

Students in the John Jay lounge in the 1950s
The first residents of what the New York Times had deemed the "Skyscraper Dorm", however, were agitated by its unreliable elevator service. Their irritation was expressed in a Times story headlined "Stair-climbing Stirs Columbia Students". Graffiti on one elevator noted "a fellow dropped dead from old age waiting for this elevator". Elevator service in the building remains faulty to this day.[3]

USS John Jay[edit]
During the Second World War, John Jay served as quarters for U.S. Navy midshipmen and was run, for training purposes, as if it were a naval ship, referred to as the "USS John Jay". When midshipman desired to enter the building, he would have to say to their superiors "request your permission to come aboard, sir".[4]

1967 Protest[edit]
John Jay Hall was the site of violent anti-Vietnam War protest led by the vice-chairman of the Columbia University Chapter of the SDS, Ted Gold. Over 300 protesters followed Gold into the lobby of John Jay, where they confronted the recruiting efforts the U.S. Marines had mounted there. After the protesters came under attack by right-wing students, Gold urged a retreat in order to avoid further conflict. After regrouping at the West End bar near campus, sociology professor and SDS professor Vernon Dibble invoked the skirmish inside the building to rally the dejected students. "You let them push you out of John Jay Hall today. You have to go back there again tomorrow to keep your credibility as a radical student group," he insisted.
The scuffle in John Jay Hall induced university President Grayson L. Kirk to issue a statement of new school policy: "Picketing or demonstrations may not be conducted within any University Building."[5] Nevertheless, the 1967 events in John Jay were merely the precursor to the much larger crisis surrounding the protests of 1968, in which many other buildings, notably Hamilton Hall, were occupied by striking students.

Renovations[edit]
In March 2022, the student lounge of John Jay was renamed after Walter and Shirley Wang, son and daughter-in-law of Taiwanese business magnate Wang Yung-ching, following the two's $10 million donation to improve undergraduate social spaces on campus.[6]

Notable residents[edit]
Federico García Lorca (1929–1930), Spanish poet, wrote that “my room in John Jay is wonderful. It is on the 12th floor of the dormitory, and I can see all the university buildings, the Hudson River and a distant vista of white and pink skyscrapers. On the right, spanning the horizon, is a great bridge under construction, of incredible grace and strength.”[7]

Michael Schenker (born 10 January 1955)[2] is a German guitarist. He played in the rock band UFO and leads the Michael Schenker Group (MSG). He was an early member of the hard rock band Scorpions, a band co-founded by his elder brother Rudolf Schenker. In the mid-1970s, Schenker joined UFO, playing lead and rhythm guitar. He left the band in 1978 to briefly rejoin Scorpions for the recording of Lovedrive, and then to form MSG. He has rejoined UFO three times, producing an album each time. Schenker continues to perform and record.[3] He has been called "a legendary figure in the history of metal guitar."[4]


Career[edit]
Early career and rise to fame: Scorpions and UFO[edit]
Schenker started playing guitar at an early age, after his brother Rudolf got a Gibson Flying V guitar for his birthday, which captured his imagination. His main influences were Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Leslie West, Johnny Winter and Rory Gallagher.[5] He played his first gig when he was 11, with Rudolf and the Scorpions in a nightclub. Schenker played with the Scorpions on their debut Lonesome Crow at the age of 16.[6][7]
After recording their first album, the Scorpions opened for up-and-coming UK band UFO in Germany. Schenker was invited to be lead guitarist for UFO (taking over from Bernie Marsden, himself a temporary replacement for Mick Bolton).[8] With Rudolf's blessing, Schenker accepted.
Schenker cowrote most of the songs on UFO's major label (Chrysalis Records) debut Phenomenon. His career with UFO was turbulent, sometimes walking off mid-song and causing shows to be cancelled. Despite successful albums and tours, Schenker unequivocally quit UFO after their show in Palo Alto, California, on 29 October 1978. During this tour the band had recorded six concerts, from which selected tracks would make up their live album Strangers in the Night, released after he left the band. "[Singer Phil] Mogg later claimed that I left UFO over a disagreement about which version of 'Rock Bottom' appeared on Strangers," Schenker recalled, "but don't believe everything you read."[9]
Schenker briefly rejoined Scorpions in late 1978, when they were recording Lovedrive. He composed and played lead guitar on "Another Piece of Meat", "Coast To Coast" and "Lovedrive".[6] Although it was believed for decades that those three were Schenker's only contributions to the record, during an interview with satellite radio host Eddie Trunk, Schenker vehemently maintained that he contributed to the whole album.[10] In 1979, Schenker briefly toured with the band in support of the album. He blamed his very short stay on finding out he did not enjoy playing other people's songs. He was permanently replaced by Matthias Jabs, who had originally joined Scorpions before Schenker's return.
Schenker auditioned for Aerosmith in 1979 after Joe Perry left.[11] According to Martin Huxley, Schenker stormed out of the room after producer Gary Lyons made jokes about Nazis.[12] After the death of Randy Rhoads, Ozzy Osbourne's first call was to Schenker to replace Rhoads, as the German guitarist and his iconic Flying V were a huge influence on the latter.[13] But, Osbourne claims, Schenker made too many outlandish demands (including a private jet).[14] Schenker himself, in an interview with KNAC radio, claims he was the one to say "no" to Osbourne: "If I would have joined Ozzy Osbourne, I would have screwed up my life. I was almost about to do it, and something told me: DON'T!!"[15] Schenker has also claimed that at some point he was offered, but turned down joining the likes of Deep Purple, Thin Lizzy, Ian Hunter and Motörhead in order to focus on his solo career.[16]

Michael Schenker Group, McAuley Schenker Group and UFO Reunion[edit]
Schenker in 1981
In 1979, Schenker started a solo career by founding the Michael Schenker Group (MSG). The history of MSG is strewn with personality conflicts and incidents. In 1982, original singer Gary Barden, who sang on the first two studio albums and a live album, was fired in favour of Graham Bonnet. Bonnet lasted one album (Assault Attack) and a single gig, at Sheffield University, where he drunkenly exposed himself and was subsequently fired from the band.[17] Barden rejoined MSG for the rest of the tour. He also appeared on the 1983 studio album (Built to Destroy) and the band's second live album (Rock Will Never Die).
After Barden's second departure, Schenker reorganized the band around himself and new singer Robin McAuley and renamed it the McAuley Schenker Group. The new incarnation of MSG was steered toward a more commercial hard rock sound. After three albums, Schenker and McAuley parted company. In the meantime, he briefly replaced Robbin Crosby in Ratt, appearing on their 1990 MTV Unplugged performance.
In 1993, Schenker rejoined UFO. He co-wrote (with Phil Mogg) nearly the whole of their reunion album, Walk on Water (1995), and toured with them briefly.
He then resurrected the Michael Schenker Group with all new members and recorded three more albums, Written in the Sand, The Unforgiven, and Be Aware of Scorpions before rejoining UFO for two further releases, Covenant and Sharks.


2000–present[edit]
Schenker fell on hard times in the early 2000s, despite his rejoining UFO that year.[3] He later recorded the album Arachnophobiac and supported it with two years of touring. In 2004, recognition came from Dean Guitars, which began producing a Schenker signature Dean V (with subtle differences from the Gibson, but with the split black and white trademark Schenker finish).
2005 was the 25th anniversary of the Michael Schenker Group. Schenker put together a new album of songs called Tales of Rock'n'Roll to celebrate the anniversary and enlisted singers from each iteration of the band to sing on the album. However, in that same year the collection Heavy Hitters, a set of covers featuring Schenker and a revolving group of heavy metal all-stars, was marketed as a Michael Schenker Group album, with the result that Schenker only received a flat fee.[3]
After nearly-disastrous North American and European tours in 2007, which included cancelled shows and less-than-stellar performances caused by heavy drinking, Schenker regained his composure and toured in the UK as Michael Schenker & Friends in 2008. Early 2008, Schenker worked with Gary Barden, Don Airey, Simon Phillips, and Neil Murray on a new MSG album In the Midst of Beauty, which was released in May 2008, followed by touring.
In 2009 Schenker toured extensively including Russia, UK and the US with MSG including original members Gary Barden and Chris Glenn.
In November 2010, Schenker was given the Marshall "11" award in London along with other rock legends including Ron Wood and Slash. The award was presented to Schenker by Alice Cooper, with Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi and John Paul Jones also in attendance. The award is given to "those artists and musicians who represent rock 'n' roll excess and livin' on the edge."[18]
In 2011 Schenker released a new album, Temple of Rock. It was supported with a tour of Europe, Japan and the USA. In Europe the line up included Herman Rarebell on drums and Francis Buchholz on bass, both former members of Scorpions (Rarebell also joined the band for the Japanese dates) and Doogie White, formerly singer for Rainbow and Yngwie Malmsteen. With this line-up he recorded the album Bridge the Gap which was released in 2013.
In August 2012 Schenker received a Lifetime Achievement in Rock and Roll Award from Vegas Rocks! Magazine. The award was presented by David Coverdale of Whitesnake. During the award ceremony Schenker performed with Sammy Hagar of Chickenfoot, Montrose and Van Halen.
In 2016, Schenker toured Japan under the name of "The Michael Schenker Fest" featuring current and former singers: Doogie White, Gary Barden, Graham Bonnet and Robin McAuley, bassist Chris Glen, drummer Ted MacKenna and keyboardist/guitarist Steve Mann, releasing one live album "Fest: Live Tokyo International Forum Hall" (2Cd/Dvd) following two more albums, Revelation (2018) and Resurrection (2019). This lineup disbanded after the loss of the drummer Ted Mackenna in January that year.
In 2021, Schenker announced the return to the MSG brand, releasing "Immortal" with some of former MSG/ Fest members: singers Michael Voss, Doogie White, Robin MacAuley and Gary Barden, bassist Barry Sparks, guitarist Steve Mann and drummer Bodo Schopp along with special guests: former Rainbow singers Joe Lynn Turner and Ronnie Romero, longtime collaborators Simon Phillips and Brian Tichy on drums. The following year MSG released the album "Universal" featuring a new steady lineup with Mann, Schopp, Romero and bassist Barry Sparks. And as usual some special guest such as vocalists Ralph Scheepers (Primal Fear) and Michael Kiske (Helloween), former Rainbow members, keyboardist Tony Carey, drummer Bobby Rondinelli and bassist Bob Daisley. In July 2022 Dutch bassist Barend Corbois (ex-Blind Guardian) was announced as the new touring bass player.

Instruments and sound[edit]
Schenker in 2022
Schenker's main guitar for most of his career was a Gibson Flying V, which he typically played through a "cocked" wah-wah pedal (switched on but left in a single position, around halfway through the travel of the foot pedal, and used as an equaliser to strengthen the midrange "sweet spot"[3]) and Marshall amplifiers. Schenker's "unmistakable midrange tone"[3] was emphasised by the partially engaged wah pedal,[19] as exemplified on the song "Rock Bottom" from the live UFO album Strangers in the Night, was listed among the 50 greatest tones of all time by Guitar Player magazine.[20] Since 2004, Schenker has switched to using a signature model Dean V.[21]
In 2007 Dean Guitars, after producing Schenker's signature Dean V, also made two acoustic models with the familiar black and white "V" design.[22]

Awards and recognition[edit]
Placed on Guitar World magazine's 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists.[23]
In 2010 Schenker was given the Marshall "11" award.[24]
Schenker accepted his "Rock Guitar Legend" award at the Vegas Rocks! Magazine Music Awards 2012.[citation needed]
On 16 June 2014, Schenker was honored the Golden God Icon Award at the Metal Hammer Golden God Awards at the IndiO2 in London.[citation needed]
Influence[edit]
Schenker has been on the covers of many guitar magazines and has influenced many notable guitar players, including Kirk Hammett[25] and James Hetfield[26] (Metallica),[27] Dave Mustaine and Marty Friedman (Megadeth),[27][28][29] Dimebag Darrell (Pantera),[27][30] Alex Skolnick and Eric Peterson (Testament),[27][31] Mike McCready (Pearl Jam),[27] Gary Holt (Exodus),[27][32][33] Rob Cavestany (Death Angel),[34] Adrian Smith (Iron Maiden),[27] Slash,[27] John Norum (Europe), Paul Gilbert,[27] Randy Rhoads,[27] George Lynch (Dokken), Warren DeMartini (Ratt),[27] John Petrucci (Dream Theater),[27][35] Michael Amott  (Arch Enemy),[27] Dan Spitz (Anthrax), Criss Oliva (Savatage), Jeff Waters (Annihilator),[27] Phil Campbell (Motörhead), Kerry King (Slayer),[27] and Syu (Galneryus).[36]

History[edit]

The town was established in 1787 by American Revolutionary War Lieutenant Colonel and Virginia statesman, Leven Powell. He purchased the land for Middleburg at $2.50 per acre in 1763 from Joseph Chinn, a first cousin of George Washington. It had been called "Chinn's Crossroads" and was then called Powell Town.  When Leven Powell declined to have the town named after him, the town was called Middleburgh, and later, simply Middleburg.  The village is located midway between the port of Alexandria[5] and Winchester, Virginia, on the Ashby Gap trading route (now followed by U.S. Route 50).
In 1863, Middleburg witnessed two skirmishes during the Gettysburg Campaign of the Civil War.
From the early 1900s, Middleburg began welcoming visitors who participated in foxhunting and steeplechasing. The village soon earned a reputation as the "Nation's Horse and Hunt Capital", attracting prominent visitors from across the U.S. Middleburg is the home of the 15,000-square-foot (1,400 m2) National Sporting Library research center for horse and field sports, which publishes Thoroughbred Heritage on the Internet. A new addition is being made to include an art gallery and museum.
In 1961, activists of the Civil Rights Movement pressed John F. Kennedy on local segregation issues during his residency outside town. That year, he and Jackie had rented Glen Ora.[6]
The Middleburg Historic District, comprising the 19th-century center of town, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The oldest building in town, the Red Fox Inn & Tavern,[7] was originally established in 1728 by Joseph Chinn as Chinn's Ordinary and is billed as the oldest continually operated inn in the U.S.  The oldest known house still in use as a residence, "Middleburg House," was built in 1779.    Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are Benton, the Burrland Farm Historic District, Green Pastures, Huntland, Mill House, Gen. William Mitchell House, Much Haddam, Unison Historic District, and Welbourne.[8][9]

Geography[edit]
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.6 square mile (1.5 km2), all land. The elevation is 486 feet.[10][11]

US 50 in Middleburg
Transportation[edit]
U.S. Route 50 is the only primary highway directly serving Middleburg. US 50 continues westward from Middleburg to Winchester. Heading east, US 50 reaches Fairfax, continues on through Washington, D.C., and eventually ends in Ocean City, Maryland.

Rosey RowswellBornAlbert Kennedy Rowswell(1884-02-01)February 1, 1884Alton, Illinois, USDiedFebruary 6, 1955(1955-02-06) (aged 71)Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USNationalityAmericanOccupationSportscasterYears active1936–1954OrganizationPittsburgh Pirates
Albert Kennedy "Rosey" Rowswell (February 1, 1884 – February 6, 1955) was an American radio sportscaster, best known for being the first full-time play-by-play announcer for the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball club, for whom he worked exclusively during 19 consecutive seasons. Rowswell was affectionately dubbed "Rosey" by baseball people and revering fans alike.
Born in Alton, Illinois, Rowswell was raised in Tarentum, Pennsylvania, where he developed a passion for baseball.[1]


Early career[edit]
Rowswell, whose previous occupation was as a secretary at Pittsburgh's Third Presbyterian Church,[2] began his broadcasting career in the first decade of the 20th century as announcer on a network program. He joined the Pittsburgh broadcasting staff from 1933 through 1935, until becoming the distinctive voice of the Pirates in its 1936 season.[1] He stayed with the team for the rest of his life, delivering the games with a gaudy yet completely infusive and cheerful style[3] that became familiar to Pirates listeners through the WWSW and KDKA airwaves.[4][5]
The hiring of Rowswell was based on his ability as an after dinner speaker, which gained him a reputation in that area, as well as for his notorious prestige as the Pirates number one fan. At this point, he had not missed a Pirates home game since the 1909 season[5] and even traveled with the team. In recognition of his support and loyalty to the team, the 1925 World Series Champion Pirates[6] presented to him a gold baseball charm as a reward for his unconditional support. For Rosie, the Pirates were his "Picaroonies" and he worshiped the home team as if they were his extended family.[3] There was genuine affection for a generally helpless franchise.[7]
But after being hired by the Pirates, Rowswell did not travel with the team for road games. He stayed in Pittsburgh and recreated the game action, wholeheartedly, after it came in over the teleprinter, usually an inning or so behind. While most of his early broadcasts were solo, he was eventually joined by his future successor Bob Prince and the then Pirates co-owner Bing Crosby.[5]
Rowswell, who always called the Pirates "Buccos", also developed a colorful language pattern to describe a wide variety of plays.[8]

Pet expressions[edit]
He gained notoriety for his pet expressions such "a doozie maroonie", when a Pirate slapped an extra-base hit; the "o-o-l-l-ld dipsy doodle" to remark a breaking pitch that caused a rival batter to strike out, and "put 'em on and take 'em off" to describe a double play. Then, when Pittsburgh was able to load the bases, he would use the phrase "They're F.O.B." (full of Bucs). On other occasions, in case the rival team put on a hitting display, or the Pirates lost the game, he moaned deeply: "Oh!, my achin' back."[9]
But perhaps his most memorable expression came when a Pirate belted a home run.[5] In lieu of a simple "It's outta here", "Going. . . going . . . gone," or some trite statement, Rowswell called upon a mythical relative created by him, and shouted "Raise the window, Aunt Minnie. Here it comes, right into your petunia patch! Then came a sound effect of a big crash like the sound of a window breaking. "That's too bad," Rosey cried. "Aunt Minnie never made it in time."[3][5][9]
Sometimes Rowswell carried a slide whistle and, whenever a member of the Pirates connected on a pitch, he would blow on the whistle and say "Hurry up, Aunt Minnie; raise the window! At that point, his fellow broadcaster Bob Prince would drop a tray filled with an assortment of noise makers to the ground to simulate the smashing of Aunt Minnie's window.[5][10]
Rowswell made no attempt to hide his unconditional love for the Pirates. In fact, during one of his one-sided broadcasts he prompted Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, then commissioner of baseball, to express of him: "Why, they tell me there are people living in Pittsburgh who don't even know the names of the other seven teams in the National League". To wit, he replied: "Judge, I just try to educate the fans to love the Pirates as much as I do".[5] He also was very active in community affairs and would give on-air birthday wishes to his loyal fans.[5]

Writings[edit]
Rowswell was also an author who published several volumes of verse which were widely circulated. His sentimental, optimistic poems were in the same vein as the light verse of Nick Kenny and Edgar Guest, who wrote syndicated columns in the early 20th century. His best known work was Should You Go First, an emotional ode dedicated to his wife.[5] Having established himself as a respected after dinner speaker, he enhanced his inspirational talks with poems of his own and selected anecdotes. He usually concluded the evening with an opportunity for members of the audience to raise questions.[5][10]
Rosie Rowswell died in Pittsburgh, just five days after his 71st birthday. At the time of his death from uremic poisoning, he was planning to join the Pirates in their Bradenton, Florida spring training camp in preparation for his 20th season of broadcasting. He is buried at Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

A victimless crime is an illegal act that typically either directly involves only the perpetrator or occurs between consenting adults.[1] Because it is consensual in nature, whether there involves a victim is a matter of debate.[1][2]  Definitions of victimless crimes vary in different parts of the world and different law systems,[1] but usually include possession of any illegal contraband, recreational drug use, prostitution and prohibited sexual behavior between consenting adults, assisted suicide, and smuggling among other similar infractions.[1][3]
In politics, a lobbyist or an activist might use the term victimless crime with the implication that the law in question should be abolished.[4]
Victimless crimes are, in the harm principle of John Stuart Mill, "victimless" from a position that considers the individual as the sole sovereign, to the exclusion of more abstract bodies such as a community or a state against which criminal offenses may be directed.[5] They may be considered offenses against the state rather than society.[1]


Definition[edit]
According to the University of Chicago's vice scholar, Jim Leitzel, three characteristics can be used to identify whether a crime is a victimless crime: if the act is excessive, is indicative of a distinct pattern of behavior, and its adverse effects impact only the person who has engaged in it.[6]
In theory, each polity determines its own laws so as to maximize the happiness of its citizens. But as knowledge, behavior and values change, laws in most countries lag greatly behind these social changes. Once a majority believes that the law is unnecessary, this law prohibits a victimless crime, until it is repealed.

Examples[edit]
Many victimless crimes begin because of a desire to obtain illegal products or services that are in high demand. Criminal penalties thus tend to limit the supply more than the demand, driving up the black-market price and creating monopoly profits for those criminals who remain in business. This "crime tariff" encourages the growth of sophisticated and well-organized criminal groups. Organized crime in turn tends to diversify into other areas of crime. Large profits provide ample funds for bribery of public officials, as well as capital for diversification.[7]
The War on Drugs is a commonly cited example of prosecution of victimless crime. The reasoning behind this is that drug use does not directly harm other people. One argument is that the criminalization of drugs leads to highly inflated prices for drugs. For example, Bedau and Schur found in 1974 that "In England the pharmacy cost of heroin [was] 0.06 cents per grain. In the United States street price [was] $30–90 per grain." This inflation in price is believed to drive addicts to commit crimes such as theft and robbery, which are thought to be inherently damaging to society, in order to be able to purchase the drugs on which they are dependent.
In addition to the creation of a black market for drugs, the War on Drugs is argued by proponents of legalization to reduce the workforce by damaging the ability of those convicted to find work. It is reasoned that this reduction of the workforce is ultimately harmful to an economy reliant on labor. The number of drug arrests increases every year. In a poll taken by the Bureau of Justice Statistics between 1980 and 2009, "[over a] 30-year period...[arrest] rates for drug possession or use doubled for whites and tripled for blacks."[8]
According to economist Walter Block, illegal immigration and emigration is a victimless crime from a libertarian perspective.[9]
Vera Bergelson states that victimless crime comes in four main varieties:[10]

An act that does not harm others (suicide, drug use, unemployment)
A transaction between consenting adults that does not harm others (assisted suicide, gambling, prostitution)
An act whose consequences are borne by society at large (tax evasion, insider trading)
Actions which are banned due to being considered immoral (homosexual sex, incest, flag burning)
Legalization of victimless acts[edit]
Many activities that were once considered crimes are no longer illegal in some countries, at least in part because of their status as victimless crimes.
One example is the British sturdy beggar laws that applied the death penalty to unemployment.
Two large categories of victimless crimes are sexual pleasure and recreational drug use (drug pleasure). On the first,

Homosexual sex has been legalized in many countries,[11][12] the first one being France in 1791.[13]
Other sexual matters considered victimless crimes and proposed for legalization include consensual adult incest[14][15] and sexting by teenagers (considered child pornography).[16]
Marijuana use is forbidden by law in Australia but is the most "widely used illicit drug" in the country, just as it is in countries such as the United States and New Zealand.[17] Prohibition of alcohol in the United States, repealed in 1933, is considered a failed "social experiment" because many citizens ignored what it stipulated, turning to home-made spirits in lieu of licensed alcoholic drinks and resultantly making problems worse.[18] In the United States today, tension over marijuana legalization is in response to the current marijuana prohibition in most states,[19] but there are efforts to legalize cannabis in many countries such as the United States and Australia, as its legalization has the potential to greatly increase revenue.[17][20]
Prostitution is legal in many countries, though usually restricted. The Netherlands legalized prostitution in 1999, and was one of the first countries to do so. As of 2012, however, it has been considering policy changes to severely restrict it.[21]
Adultery (sexual acts between a married person and a person other than the spouse) and fornication (sexual acts between unmarried people) have not been prosecuted in the United States for over 50 years, although the laws against them, like those against sodomy, are still on the books in several states. However, because sodomy laws were struck down as unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas, the laws against fornication would also be unconstitutional as was recognized by the Supreme Court of Virginia in Martin v. Ziherl.

Controversy[edit]

A major concern among opponents of legalizing victimless crimes is the degradation of societal moral standards, but punishing citizens for their choice to engage in victimless acts declared by the law to be immoral is difficult. While the United States's typical response to crimes is retroactive, the illegality of victimless crimes is a more preventative approach to justice and is highly controversial.[22]
Controversies over victimless crime deal mostly with the question of whether a crime can ever actually be victimless. With relation to drugs and their pathway to consumption, the impact of the drug trade and liability laws on drug dealers, their families, and other unforeseen actors may end in victimization.[23] Another act often considered a victimless crime is the possession of pornography, especially fictional child pornography. However, those who hold this position typically acknowledge the victimization that can occur to performers during production of non-fictional pornography.[24]
In contrast, there is the argument for restraining legal powers to allow citizens the freedom to make victimless personal choices that may or may not be perceived as morally wrong.[22] Preventative law, such as sex offender registries and anti-social behavior orders, blurs the distinction between criminal and civil law because victimless crime is typically difficult to categorize and criminalize. This is problematic because it causes a distortion of traditional procedures of the criminal and civil of aspects of law by enabling confusion and procedural interchangeability.[22]

History[edit]
The establishment of the Vakıflar was part of Atatürk's Reforms. It was established under the authority of Prime Minister of Turkey, İsmet İnönü on 3 March 1924,[1] alongside the Directorate of Religious Affairs (Turkish: Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı).
These two departments replaced the Ottoman era ministry with the responsibility of governing Islamic affairs, the Ministry of Sharia and the Foundations (Şerriye ve Evkaf Vekaleti). This ministry had survived the Turkish War of Independence into the Republican era and the 1st government of Turkey.
Aside from its stated responsibilities, a secondary aim was to enable the confiscation by the state of properties belonging to traditionally non-Muslim minorities (such as Jews, Greeks, and Armenians) by transferring such properties into foundations so that they could be placed under the administration of the Vakıflar. However, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, the VGM would frequently seize and dispose of real-estate assets belonging to religious minorities on the basis of dubious court decisions.[2] A notable example of this was the confiscation of the Tuzla Armenian Children's Camp in 1984.

Responsibilities[edit]
The directorate manages the estates and restorations of around 18,500 historical buildings and 67,000 estates.[3] The directorate employs about 38,000 people. It also handles charity organisations, such as food or monetary support, based on the charters of the managed foundations.[4] Currently, actions of 4,500 foundations are audited by the directorate.
As of March 2017 the Directorate General of Foundations has a 58.5% share stake in VakıfBank[5] In May 2017, reports emerged that the Turkish government was considering a draft law to transfer that 58.5 percent stake, worth around $2.5 billion, to Vakıf Katılım Bankası because it is sharia-compliant.[6]

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III[c] is a 2017 role-playing video game developed by Nihon Falcom. The game is a part of the Trails series, itself a part of the larger The Legend of Heroes series, and serves as a direct sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II. 
Trails of Cold Steel III was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2017 and worldwide in October 2019. Ports for Nintendo Switch, Windows, and Amazon Luna were released in 2020, with a port for Google Stadia following in April 2021. A PlayStation 5 port was released in February 2024. A direct sequel, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel IV, was released in 2018.


Gameplay[edit]
The gameplay of Trails of Cold Steel III is similar to the previous two Trails of Cold Steel games, being a traditional Japanese role-playing video game with turn-based battles. An emphasis was made on speeding up battles, including making transitions into battle scenes more seamless, and being able to map out more battle commands to specific buttons rather than various menus, though battles are still primarily menu-based.[1] The game contains a new system called "Brave Order" which lets players expend a new resource built up during battle called "Brave Points "to get special effects such as buffs or heals.[2] The new "Break" system was also added, which adds a "Break Gauge" bar to enemies. Attacking an enemy depletes its break gauge bar, and when fully depleted the enemy is weakened for one turn.[3]

Plot[edit]
The game is a direct sequel to the prior two Trails of Cold Steel games, picking up two years after the events of Trails of Cold Steel II and several months after the Northern War between the Imperial army of Erebonia and the Northern Jaegers of North Ambria, which resulted in the annexation of North Ambria. The story is centered around Rean Schwarzer, now an instructor at Thors Military Academy's Branch Campus, as well as the students of the new Class VII and the rest of his classmates from the prior two entries, exploring subjects such as Rean's past and what his classmates have been up to since the events of the prior games.
The new Class VII consists of Juna Crawford (an exchange student from Crossbell), Kurt Vander (a member of Vander family formerly guarding the Royal family), Altina Orion (a member of the Intelligence Division and younger sister of Millium Orion), later joined by Ash Carbide from Raquel (who is later revealed to be an orphan of Hamel), and Musse Egret (a noble young lady who is actually the heir of house Cayenne).
While teaching his students, Rean is ordered by the Imperial government to resolve numerous conflicts arising all across Erebonia (mainly caused by Ouroboros, who are trying to retake the 'Phantasmal Blaze Plan', stolen from them by Chancellor Osborne in the previous game's finale) as part of the campus's field exercises, assisted by his former classmates of the old Class VII. On their missions, they learned that Rutger Claussell, the Jaeger King and Fie's foster father who was believed to be dead, and Arianrhod the Steel Maiden, an anguis of Ouroboros who is actually Lianne Sandlot, an Erebonian historical figure, are actually alive and are the Awakeners of two of the Divine Knights, Zector and Argreion respectively. They also learn more about the origins of the Divine Knights, that they are the fragments of the Great One, a being created when the Sept-Terrions of Fire and Earth fused into one after an intense battle between the two. The Kin of Fire and Kin of Earth worked together to contain the unstable Great One, giving birth to the seven Divine Knights, but they were unable to contain its curse, which influenced Erebonia for many centuries, making the people of the empire become greedy and violent and leading to tragedies such as the Attack of the Dark Dragon, the Dark Ages, the War of the Lions, the Hamel tragedy, the Hundred Days War with Liberl, the annexation of Crossbell and the Northern War. The groups later changed their names; the Kin of Fire becoming the Witches of the Hexen Clan (with Emma being one of them), and the Kin of Earth becoming the Gnomes, and the latter eventually cutting ties with the former.
Rean also learns of his origins. During his time as a brigadier general in the army, Osborne rose up against the officers who were setting up the Hamel tragedy to start a war with Liberl. In response they set his house ablaze, killed his wife and mortally wounded his son. Osborne gave his heart to Rean to save him and later left him in the Schwarzer's care.
During a party in the Imperial palace, Ash Carbide, who is being manipulated by the curse, assassinates the emperor. This leads Rean and both generations of Class VII to realize that Ouroboros, the Gnomes, and Chancellor Osborne are plotting to unleash the curse of the Great One and start the Great Twilight, an event that heralds the return of the Great One and the end of the world. The members of Class VII resolve to stop them, and during their battle with Osborne's forces, Jusis realizes that his brother Rufus Albarea, the imperial governor of Crossbell and the primary member of Osborne's Ironbloods, is actually his illegitimate cousin who was adopted by the family in order to save face. While fighting against the "Nameless One", a creature that contained the power of the Great One's curse, Millium sacrifices her life to protect Rean and her sister Altina. Seeing Millium die causes Rean to lose control of his Spirit Unification power, fly into a rage, and slay the Nameless One, which releases the curse across Erebonia, beginning the Great Twilight, and the end of the world.

Development and release[edit]
Intentions to create a third Trails of Cold Steel game were announced in December 2015.[4] Initial planning began in early 2016, though the development team was divided on which platforms the game should release for.[5] On one hand, the PlayStation Vita was preferred, due to its larger installed base in Japan, and prior entries in the series being released there. However, the team also wanted to consider using the much more powerful PlayStation 4, which would greatly help with the game's scope.[6] Full-scale development began around mid-2016.[5] Like the previous Trails of Cold Steel entries, it was developed using the PhyreEngine game engine.[7] The game was officially revealed in December 2016.[8][9] Unlike previous two entries, no Vita or PlayStation 3 versions were developed.[10] It was mentioned in the shareholder's meeting that a deciding factor in developing the game for the PS4 was to help ensure higher international sales for the game as the PS4 had a much larger userbase in most countries outside of Japan at the time.[10][11][12] This premise was reiterated by Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo:

"Foreign sales have reached a point with both the Trails and Ys series and  where we can't ignore them from a development angle anymore. Ys: Memories of Celceta, for example, sold more outside of Japan than it did inside of Japan. Because Vita has kind of been on the decline for a while outside of Japan, and because the PS4 userbase is pretty established elsewhere, we have begun shifting toward PS4 development".[12]
The Japanese release was initially scheduled for Q3 2017 for the PlayStation 4.[13] It was released in Japan for the PlayStation 4 on September 28.[14] Localization into English and French was handled by NIS America rather than Xseed Games, who localized the first two Trails of Cold Steel games.[15] The announcement that NIS America was taking over caused some concern among fans, due to the issues with the initial localization of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana.[16] This concern was settled after confirmation that key localization staffs of the first two Cold Steel games were involved.[17] Initially set for a September 2019 release for PS4 in North America and Europe, it was later delayed to October 22.[18][19][20] A Nintendo Switch port by Engine Software was released in Japan on March 19, 2020,[21][22] in North America and Europe on June 30, and in Oceania on July 7.[23] A Windows port by Engine Software and PH3 Games was released on March 23 the same year.[24] A version for Amazon Luna was released on October 20, 2020.[25] A Stadia version was released on April 1, 2021,[26] while a PlayStation 5 version bundled with Trails of Cold Steel IV was released on February 16, 2024.[27]

After the positive reception of the first two Trails of Cold Steel games, journalists were generally enthusiastic for the prospect of a third entry, though many lamented the lack of a Vita version.[8][10][36][13]
The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel III received "generally favorable" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.[28][29] Reviewing the North American release, Nintendo Life called it an "excellent addition to the series", although they said it had slow pacing at times.[37] NintendoWire praised the "naturally brilliant" soundtrack, but did say it wasn't the easiest game for those unfamiliar with the storylines in prior games.[38] Frontline Gaming Japan praised the "strong narrative and exhaustive worldbuilding", as well as a "fun battle system" and payoff for long-term fans. They criticized the dated graphics and thought previous soundtracks in the series were stronger.[39]

Sales[edit]
Trails of Cold Steel III debuted as the best-selling game in its week of release in Japan, selling 87,261 copies.[40] This was a significant drop from the 151,781 units Cold Steel II had sold in its first week.[41] Media Create attributed this decline to the lack of a PlayStation Vita version.[42] Despite this, Dengeki's sales reports still estimated that approximately 80% of the game's physical stock was sold at launch,[43] and Falcom announced that the game had the highest digital game sales in the series, as of October 2017.[44]

ZAKA (Hebrew: זק"א, abbreviation for Zihuy Korbanot Ason, זיהוי קרבנות אסון‎, lit. 'Disaster Victim Identification') is a series of voluntary community emergency response teams in Israel, each operating in a police district (two in the Central District due to geographic considerations). These organizations are recognized by the Israeli government. The full name is "ZAKA – Identification, Extraction and Rescue – True Kindness" (זק"א - איתור חילוץ והצלה - חסד של אמת‎). The two largest ZAKA factions are Zaka Tel Aviv and ZAKA Search and Rescue.


Background[edit]
ZAKA volunteers respond to the scenes of violent attacks and homicides throughout Israel. The volunteers are trained paramedics and are on call 24/7.[1] ZAKA collects the remains of the dead, including their blood, so that they may be buried in accordance with Jewish religious law. Volunteers are allowed to work on Shabbat, because the sabbath can be broken in matters of life and death.[2]
Members of ZAKA, most of whom are Orthodox Jews, assist ambulance crews, aid in the identification of the victims of violence, road accidents and other disasters, and where necessary gather body parts and spilled blood for proper Jewish burial. They also provide first aid and rescue services, and help with the search for missing persons and participate in international rescue and recovery operations.[3][4][5]
After acts of violence, ZAKA volunteers also collect the bodies and body parts of non-Jews, including suicide bombers, for return to their families. The phrase "Chesed shel Emet" refers to doing "kindness" for the benefit of the deceased, which is considered to be "true kindness", because the (deceased) beneficiaries of the kindness cannot return the kindness.[6]

History[edit]

The organization traces its roots to a group of religious volunteers who assisted in the recovery of human remains after the Tel Aviv Jerusalem bus 405 attack in Israel in 1989, during the First Intifada. ZAKA was formally established in 1995.[2]
During the attack on bus line 405 in 1990, Yehuda Meshi Zahav arrived with other yeshiva boys to provide first aid to the victims. On his way home, he concluded that if in the enemy's view everyone is equal, so too for him. In the 1990s, he arrived at the scenes of suicide bombing attacks in Israel, among other things, and treated the bodies of those killed. As a result, ZAKA (Disaster Victim Identification) was founded. In his capacity as Chairman of ZAKA, he worked for inter-religious and secular reconciliation.[7]
In 2005, ZAKA established a minorities unit with Bedouin, Muslim, and Druze volunteers to serve Israel's non-Jewish communities, primarily Bedouin in the Negev and Druze in the Galilee. These units also function when religious Jews cannot, on the Jewish Sabbath[dubious  – discuss] and holidays. According to Jewish law, Jews may violate the Sabbath to save a life, but not to deal with the dead. In 2010, ZAKA said it planned to increase its minorities units to 125 volunteers.[1]
In 2004, a group of ZAKA volunteers flew to The Hague, with the wreckage of the bus destroyed in the Jerusalem bus 19 suicide bombing on 29 January 2004. The wreckage, along with pictures of 950 victims, was taken to Washington, D.C. to urge the United States government to act against the Palestinian resistance movement.[8] The bus was later displayed at various US universities.[9]
In August 2007, ZAKA members were accused of burning down a secret crematorium in Israel. Most Jews believe Jews should be buried according to religious tradition, not cremated. ZAKA's founder Yehuda Meshi Zahav denied any involvement of ZAKA in the arson but called the existence of the crematorium a "desecration of the dead" and said that the crematorium was "destined to disappear in flames."[10]
In January 2016, after two failed attempts, the United Nations granted ZAKA the status of a 'consultant NGO'.[11]

Organization[edit]
Its volunteers are almost all ultra-Orthodox Jews.[2] However as of 2010, more than 125 Muslim, Druze, and Bedouin volunteers provided services to non-Jewish victims.[1]
In 2010, ZAKA volunteers numbered 1,500.[1]
The organization says it employs around 4,000 volunteers, though an 2022 investigation by Haaretz, based on "documents and testimonies by senior figures in the organization", said there were fewer than 1,000 volunteers, alleged that the numbers were inflated to increase funding, and found volunteers who said they had not received the biannual training mandated by the Interior Ministry.[12] ZAKA denied the report.[12] In 2017, its annual operating budget was about one million shekels.[13] The New York Times reported a membership of "more than 3,000 volunteers, most of them ultra-Orthodox Jewish men" in 2024.[14]

International rescue & recovery operations[edit]
In late 2004 and early 2005, members of ZAKA provided assistance in Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Forensic teams reportedly dubbed the group "the team that sleeps with the dead" because they toiled nearly 24 hours a day at Buddhist pagodas in Thailand that had been transformed into morgues to identify those who died in the tsunami. The experience of ZAKA members, who reportedly see 38 bodies a week on average in Israel, helped the Israeli forensic team to identify corpses faster than many of the other forensic teams that operated in Thailand in the aftermath of the disaster, which placed them in high demand with grieving families.[15]
In February 2007, ZAKA sent a 10-person search and rescue team, consisting primarily of rescue divers, to Paris to search for a missing Israeli defense official. The mission was funded by the Defense Ministry at an expected cost of $80,000.[16]
In November 2008, ZAKA volunteers went to Mumbai, India following terrorist attacks that included a Jewish center among its targets.[citation needed]
Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a six-man ZAKA International Search and Rescue Unit delegation arrived in Haiti to assist with search and recovery efforts. Working with the Mexican military delegation and Jewish volunteers from Mexico, eight students trapped under the rubble of the collapsed eight-storey Port-au-Prince University building were rescued on the first day after their arrival.[17][18][19]
Teams of ZAKA volunteers were sent to Japan in March 2011 to assist in search-and-rescue after the devastating earthquake and subsequent tsunami.[20]
A ZAKA team was part of an Israeli mission to Nepal in late April 2015 to help search for casualties in the aftermath of the earthquake and subsequent avalanches.[21]
In January 2017, a team of ZAKA volunteers participated in the response to earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.[22]
In January 2019, a ZAKA team deployed in Brazil to conduct search and rescue operations following a dam collapse in Brumadinho.[23]

Public recognition[edit]
ZAKA is known in Israel as the primary Chesed Shel Emes organization, though other such organizations exist.[24]

Casualties and injuries[edit]
Several ZAKA volunteers died as a result of the October 7th, 2023 Hamas attack. Danny Vovk, a ZAKA volunteer driver, was killed during the Netiv HaAsara massacre.[25] Volunteer Motti Botzkin suffered a stress induced heart attack after 16 days of caring for and identifying bodies following the attack.[26]
Widespread psychological trauma was reported among ZAKA volunteers as a result of the scenes that they worked to clean.[14]

Controversies[edit]
After Yehuda Meshi-Zahav, ZAKA's co-founder and main figurehead for more than 30 years, was awarded the Israel Prize in March 2021,[27][28] multiple accusations surfaced of his having committed sexual assaults against women, girls and boys over several decades, with the knowledge of others in the community.[29][30][31] Channel 13 reported that ZAKA officials had known about the abuse allegations and worked to silence the claims.[32] Meshi-Zahav subsequently resigned ZAKA leadership and relinquished the Israel Prize.[33] In response to the accusations, a senior ZAKA official said the organization had now "washed its hands" of Meshi-Zahav and that "given the accusations against him, it's very hard to remember the good that he's done. We always saw him with women and suspected that he was a deviant, but we never suspected he was a pedophile or a rapist. In retrospect, this [the allegations] explains a lot of things we saw over the years.[34] Following a suicide attempt in April 2021, Meshi-Zahav entered a coma and died in June 2022.[33] Gideon Aran, a Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Hebrew University, said in his book about ZAKA that most ZAKA volunteers, while familiar with Meshi-Zahav and the colorful image of himself that he had cultivated, probably had no inkling of his misconduct; only a very few senior members were partially aware of his inclinations, without suspecting there was criminal and pathological behavior involved.[27] Following the scandal, Aran found that aside from a few changes in personnel, the organization's principles, sentiments and activities remained the same, and the damage to its public reputation was minimal.[27]
In the aftermath of the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, ZAKA volunteers were said by Israeli newspaper Haaretz to have given several incorrect reports of atrocities allegedly committed by Hamas against children and babies that were widely circulated in the media.[35][36] A ZAKA leader acknowledged mistakes were made: "When we find bodies that are burned or in a state of decomposition, we can easily be mistaken and think the body is a child's ... Our volunteers were confronted with traumatic scenes and sometimes misinterpreted what they saw."[36]
A subsequent Haaretz report stated that in order to get media exposure, ZAKA spread accounts of atrocities that never happened and released sensitive and graphic photos in an effort to shock people into donating.[37][38] Haaretz also said that while hundreds of ZAKA volunteers did important work under challenging conditions, the organization acted unprofessionally on the ground, often mixing up the remains of multiple victims in the same bag and creating little or no documentation.[37][38]

The Hydraulic engine house  is part of the "Underfall Yard" in Bristol Harbour in Bristol, England.
The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed,[1] as is the hydraulic engine house itself.[2] It replaced the original pumping house which is now The Pump House public house. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and originally contained two steam engines made by the Worthington Corporation. These were compound surface condensing cylinders of 17.5 inches (440 mm) diameter.[3] These were replaced in 1907 by the current machines from Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley. It powered the docks' hydraulic system of cranes, bridges and locks [4] until 2010.
Water is pumped from the harbour to a header tank and then fed by gravity to the high pressure pumps, where it is pressurised thence raising the external hydraulic accumulator. This stores the hydraulic energy ensuring a smooth delivery of pressure and meaning that the pumps do not need to be running the whole time nor be capable of supplying the instantaneous peak demands. The working pressure is 750 lbs/square inch. The external accumulator was added about 1954 when the original inside the building's tower became difficult to service (but it remains in place). The building originally contained a pair of steam powered pumps[5] however these were replaced with three electrically driven ones in 1907.[6] The engine house provided the power for equipment such as the lock gates and cranes until 2010.[7]
The visitor centre in the hydraulic power house opened in time for Easter 2016.[8]

Rush Elmore (February 27, 1819 - August 14, 1864) was an American attorney and jurist who served as an associate judge of the Supreme Court of the Kansas Territory.


Early life[edit]
Elmore was born in Autauga County, Alabama, on February 27, 1819.[1][2] His father, John Archer Elmore, was a soldier in the American Revolution who served under General Nathanael Greene.[3] He became an attorney in private practice in Montgomery, Alabama after studying at the University of Alabama.[1][2] In May 1846, at the outbreak of the Mexican-American War, Elmore raised a company and became its captain.[3] After the war, he returned to Montgomery to continue his private practice.

Career[edit]
In 1854, Elmore was appointed by President Franklin Pierce to become an associate judge of the newly formed Supreme Court of the Kansas Territory.[1] Elmore, along with chief judge Samuel Dexter Lecompte and associate judge Sanders W. Johnston, were all appointed as pro-slavery sympathizers.[4]
In 1855, Pierce removed Elmore, Johnston, and then-Governor Andrew Horatio Reeder after accusations were made against them for illegally purchasing Native American land. Elmore was replaced by judge Sterling G. Cato.[4] However, these accusations were later proven false, and Elmore was repromoted by President James Buchanan in 1858 upon Cato's resignation.[1]
In 1857, Elmore helped draft the Lecompton Constitution and advocated for its submission to the people of Kansas for approval.[1][5]

Later life and death[edit]
Elmore left the Court in 1860, upon Kansas' admission into the Union. Although he was a slaveowner and a supporter of slavery in Kansas, he disagreed with secession and remained loyal to the United States. He continued private practice as an attorney in Topeka, Kansas, until his death there on August 19, 1864.[2]

Marek Koterski (born 3 June 1942) is a Polish film and theatre director, screenwriter, actor, and playwright.
In 1972, he graduated in directing from the Łódź Film School.[1] Initially, he made documentaries,[citation needed] but in 1984, he gained recognition in Poland thanks to the semi-autobiographical tragicomedy Dom wariatów. This was the first of nine films Koterski went on to write and direct about his alter ego, the character Adaś Miauczyński.
Several of these, including the 1986 sequel to Dom wariatów, titled Życie wewnętrzne; the sixth and seventh films in the loose series, titled Day of the Wacko (2002) and We're All Christs (2006), respectively; and the final one, 7 uczuć (2018), won accolades. Życie wewnętrzne won a Silver Lion at the 1987 Gdynia Film Festival, and in 2002, Koterski won a Golden Lion for Day of the Wacko. In 2006, he received another Golden Lion as Best Director, this time for We're All Christs,[2] and he repeated this feat in 2018 with 7 uczuć.[3][4]
Koterski's son Michał is an actor. He portrayed Adaś Miauczyński in 7 uczuć.[5]

A medical license is an occupational license that permits a person to legally practice medicine. In most countries, a person must have a medical license bestowed either by a specified government-approved professional association or a government agency before they can practice medicine. Licenses are not granted automatically to all people with medical degrees. A medical school graduate must receive a license to practice medicine to legally be called a physician. The process typically requires testing by a medical board. The medical license is the documentation of authority to practice medicine within a certain locality. An active license is also required to practice medicine as an assistant physician, a physician assistant or a clinical officer in jurisdictions with authorizing legislation.
A professional may have their license removed due to if they are not deemed fit to practise, such as due to a lack of competence, health reasons, or ethical violations.[1]: 6  The license will limit a professional's scope of practice.[2]


Canada[edit]
Canada requires that applicants have graduated from a school registered in the World Directory of Medical Schools, and apply to sit the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination.[3] Licenses are issued by Provincial bodies. A brief history of medical licensing in Ontario and Quebec, with a list of physicians licensed prior to 1867, is available at David Crawford's website.

Criticism[edit]
An article from 2013 says of the road to licensing in Canada, "The path through immigration, residency training, licensure and employment promises to remain a difficult road to navigate," and emphasizes that the current and future demand for healthcare.[4] This emphasizes that there are a number of barriers that doctors face when it comes to practicing, yet there is a very high demand for doctors.

China[edit]
Medical practitioners in China started to be licensed for the first time when Law of the People's Republic of China on Medical Practitioners passed on June 26 1998.[5] The law, which came into effect May 1 1999,  requires all newly graduated medical students to sit the National Medical Licensing Examination, regulated by the National Medical Examination Center, and then register with the local regulatory body. The two-part exam includes a Clinical Skill (CS) test and a General Written (GW) test. The candidates must pass the CS test to take the GW test. Each year, the CS is held in July, followed by the GW in September.[6] The medical practitioners on the job who had obtained a primary medical qualification (i.e., Bachelor of Medicine) prior to law are not required to sit the exam and can directly be licensed.

Colombia[edit]

The Instituto Colombiano para el Fomento de la Educación Superior (ICFES) and the Ministry of Education regulate the medical schools that are licensed to offer medical degrees. After completing all the schools' requirements to obtain a medical degree, physicians must serve the "obligatory social service" (in rural areas, research, public health or special populations e.g., orphan children), which usually lasts one year. After completing the social service, a doctor obtains a "medical registration" at the governor's office (Gobernación) of the Department (province/state) where they served the obligatory term. This registration is the same as a license in other countries, and authorizes the physician to practice medicine anywhere in the national territory. However, to practice in other departments requires an inscription from that department. Unlike the US, there is no official licensing exam for medical graduates in Colombia, since this responsibility is delegated to medical schools that have permission to confer medical degrees.

Germany[edit]
In Germany, licensing of doctors ("Approbation") is the responsibility of the state governments. Licensed doctors are compulsory members of "Ärztekammern" (literally: "Physician chambers"), which are medical associations organized on state level. Criteria for licensing of doctors are regulated in the Approbationsordnung für Ärzte, which is a piece of federal law.[7] According to the licensing regulations, the physician must have successfully completed his medical studies and passed the (final) examination. He or she must not have engaged in negative behavior that would raise clear concerns about his or her suitability (e.g., practicing a criminal offense). Furthermore, the physician must meet the health requirements and have sufficient German language skills to be able to perform the profession.
Physicians who have not studied medicine in Germany, among others, must prove their language skills by means of a German B2 certificate and a successfully completed Fachsprachprüfung. In addition, doctors who have not studied in the EU, EEA or Switzerland must prove that their studies are equivalent. For this purpose, they usually have to pass a Kenntnisprüfung (test of competence).[8]

India[edit]
In India, certification requires that a medical school graduate pass the final MBBS examination and undergo a one-year internship in a hospital recognised by the National Medical Commission erstwhile Medical Council of India. Foreign medical graduates must take the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE), conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE). They can practice medicine throughout the country after certifying themselves as per Indian Medical Council Act, 1956. Doctors registered with any one state medical council are automatically included in the Indian Medical Register and thereby entitled to practice medicine anywhere in India.
The MCI Ethics Committee observed in a meeting held on September 2, 2004, that, "There is no necessity of registration in more than one state medical council because any doctor, who has registered with any state medical council is automatically registered in the Indian Medical Register and also by virtue of Section 27 of the IMC Act, 1956, a person, whose name is included in the IMR, can practice anywhere in India." The Registered Doctors with various State Medical Councils across India up to the year 2019 can be checked in the Medical Council of India's Indian Medical Registry official website.[9]

UK[edit]
The term "Medical License" is US-centric terminology. In the UK and in other Commonwealth countries the analogous instrument is called registration; i.e., being on the register or being/getting struck off (the register). The General Medical Council is the regulatory body for doctor's licensing in the UK. Currently, there are two types of basic registration: "Provisional Registration" and "Full Registration", and two types of specialty registration: "Specialist Registration" and "GP registration".[10] In November 2009, the GMC introduced the "licence to practise", and it is required by law that to practice medicine in the UK, all doctors must be registered and hold a license to practice.[11] The registration information for all doctors holding a license in the UK is available online at the GMC website.[12]

United States[edit]
In the United States, medical licenses are usually granted by individual states. Only those with medical degrees from schools listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools are permitted to apply for medical licensure.[13] Board certification is a separate process.
The federal government does not grant licenses. A physician practicing in a federal facility, federal prison, US Military, and/or an Indigenous Reservation may have a license from any state, not just the one they are residing in. The practice of "tele-medicine" has made it common for physicians to consult or interpret images and information from a distant location. Some states have special licensure for this. The licensure process for most physicians takes between three and six months, due to the extensive background checks, educational, training, and historical primary source verifications.

History[edit]
The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution became the underpinning for the entire medical licensing  system. Following several years of discussion and debate, the states' ratification of this amendment as part of the Bill of Rights concluded on December 15, 1791.[14] It explicitly avowed that powers not granted to the federal government, nor prohibited to the states by the Constitution.  The Tenth Amendment remains a living codification of states rights and is routinely cited by state medical boards today to justify the authority delegated to them by their state legislatures. [15] In 1811, Ohio passed legislation licensing physicians but repealed these laws in 1833. In 1817, Illinois legislated the medical practice, but had repealed these laws by 1826.[16]: 40 
The American Medical Association when formed in 1847, proposed that the state legislate medicine (rather than each of the different medical schools). Horowitz argues that this suggestion was made in order to gain greater control over medical education.[16]: 38 
In the 1870s, almost all U.S. physicians were still unlicensed.[17] The majority of physicians had M.D. degrees earned in American medical schools. The rest were mostly either homeopaths or eclectics.[18] Homeopaths were trained in a pseudoscientific system known as homeopathy that had been developed by Samuel Hahnemann. Eclectics physicians also attended medical schools, but their practice mixed mainstream medicine with Thomsonsianism, a system of herbalism. Each of these groups was organized into both national and state medical societies across the United States.[18]
In 1877, the Illinois legislature passed the Illinois medical licensing law, which led to the aggressive prosecution of physicians that were perceived as illegal or unethical.[17] Medical boards of other states (often composed of both regular and irregular physicians) followed suit.[17] Some authors claim that these efforts allowed organized regular and irregular physicians to exclude not only fraudulent practitioners, but other groups, including midwives, clairvoyants, osteopaths, Christian Scientists, and magnetic healers.[19]
In 1889, Dent v. West Virginia,[20] the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time upheld a state physician licensing law. A practitioner with insufficient credentials to obtain a medical license sued West Virginia, claiming a violation of his rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court upheld the statute noting that, while each citizen had a right to follow any lawful calling, they were subject to reasonable state restrictions. Because of the nature of medical training, the large amount of knowledge required, and the life-and-death circumstances with which physicians dealt, patients needed to rely on the assurance of a license requiring physicians to meet a minimum set of standards.
In 1956, the Federation of State Medical Boards released "A Guide to the Essentials of a Modern Medical Practice Act." [21]  The report distilled a series of recommendations that addressed five core areas: the definition of the practice of medicine; eligibility standards for licensure; licensing examinations; licensure endorsement; and the bases for probation, suspension, or revocation of a license. [14] Since its initial publication in 1956, the Essentials of a Modern Medical Practice Act has passed through thirteen updated editions, with the most recent in 2012.[14]
By the beginning of the 20th century most states had implemented licensing laws.[16]: 44 During the 20th century, medical boards sought to eliminate diploma mills by expanding their requirements for medical schools.[17] They started to dictate the length and type of education required for licensing.[17] As early as 1910, all but 12 states excluded physicians from medical practice if their schools were not found to be in "good standing".[17] Between 1910 and 1935, more than half of all American medical schools merged or closed, in some part due to all state medical boards gradually adopting and enforcing the Flexner Report's recommendations on having all schools connected to universities.[22]
Today, physicians are amongst the most highly regulated professionals with detailed criteria for licensing established by medical boards in each state, however, lack of discretionary action against physician misconduct by state medical boards has been criticized in recent years for their failure to discipline physicians, despite several consumer concerns and complaints.[17][23] [24] [25]

Criticism[edit]
The neutrality of this article is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (May 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
According to a 1979 article in the Journal of Libertarian Studies, the enactment of U.S. state medical licensing laws in the late 1800s was for the primary purpose of reducing competition and allowing physicians to make more money.[26] 
The added benefit of public safety made restrictive licensure laws more appealing to both physicians and legislators. Infrequently mentioned in the literature, is that the "public safety" that is created by reducing the number of practitioners only extends to the patients who receive medical care. Thus, the overall effect is more expensive and higher-quality medical care for fewer patients.[27]
Beyond the more general criticisms of occupational licensing that licensing increases costs and fails to improve quality, licensing in the medical profession specifically has been criticized as failing to enforce the standard practices they are charged with enforcing. In 1986, Inspector General at the United States Department of Health and Human Services said that medical boards took "strikingly few disciplinary actions" for physician misconduct.[28]
There have been a number of cases involving patient deaths where physicians only had their licenses removed years after multiple wrongful patient deaths had happened.[28][29] State medical boards have increased the number of disciplinary actions against physicians since the 1980s.[30]
Also, it has been said that because hospitals have had more legal burden placed on them in recent decades, they have more of an incentive to require that their physicians be competent. Thus, the process whereby physicians are reviewed and licensed by the state medical board results in some duplicate evaluations. The physician is evaluated both in the licensure process and then again by the hospital for the purpose of credentialing and granting hospital privileges.[31]
Laws in some states prohibit interstate telemedicine without a license to practice in the state where the patient is located. This reduces access to care.[32][33]

Patient protection[edit]
State medical boards cannot assure a high standard of care, they do not review physicians on a regular basis, nor do they evaluate clinicians at the point of care. It is provider liability that results in oversight that protects consumers, and even that is imperfect. Before they employ or associate with individual physicians, via credentialing and privileging, providers confirm the training, knowledge and skills needed to take on relevant tasks. They review any sanctions and malpractice claims.[34] There are cases where physician liability has been stripped by federal regulations, with adverse impacts, as on an Indian Reservation.

Walkergate is a Tyne and Wear Metro station, serving Walkergate, Newcastle upon Tyne in Tyne and Wear, England. It joined the network on 14 November 1982, following the opening of the fourth phase of the network, between Tynemouth and St James via Wallsend.

History[edit]
The station was opened on 22 June 1839 by the Newcastle and North Shields Railway. This later became part of the North Tyneside Loop, served by the North Eastern Railway. The station was renamed Walker Gate in April 1889. In the days of British Rail, the station was known as both Walkergate and Walker Gate. The Tyne and Wear Metro, however, uses the single word form.
Following closure for conversion in the early 1980s, the station was demolished and re-built. The original North Eastern Railway footbridge was preserved, and is now located at Pickering station, on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.[2]
The station underwent modernisation work between September 2013 and July 2014, as part of the Metro: All Change programme. This involved improvements to accessibility (including the installation of a passenger lift), aesthetic changes, and the introduction of new smart ticket machines and validators.[3][4]

Facilities[edit]
Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramps providing step-free access to both platforms, as well as a lift providing step-free access to platform 1 (for trains towards Whitley Bay). The station is equipped with ticket machines, sheltered waiting area, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins.[5][6] The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network.[7][8]
There is a small free car park available at the station, with 24 spaces. There is also the provision for cycle parking, with three cycle pods available for use.[9]

Services[edit]
As of April 2021[update], the station is served by up to five trains per hour on weekdays and Saturday, and up to four trains per hour during the evening and on Sunday.[10]

()
Nic Rouse (born 10 February 1981 in Chatham, Kent, England) is a former rugby union player for London Irish in the RFU Premiership. He previously played for Sale Sharks[2] in the Aviva Premiership. He plays as a lock. Rouse joined Sale Sharks in 2010 from Nottingham.  He had previously made over 120 appearances for Nottingham and enjoyed a short spell on loan to London Irish in 2008 when injuries to Nick Kennedy, James Hudson and Bob Casey meant the club had only 1 fit lock. 
Rouse was educated in Newbury and from the age of 5 played rugby at Newbury Rugby Club.  He joined the Bath Rugby Academy in 1999 and subsequently spent time with Caerphilly, Manchester and several seasons with Plymouth Albion before joining Nottingham in 2006 when he was awarded 'Player of the Year' in his first season.  He was named in the National One 'Dream Team' in Rugby Times twice and has represented England Students and England Counties. Rouse retired in April 2016 after ongoing injury problems.

The Jamaican dry forests is a tropical dry forest ecoregion located in southern Jamaica. 


Geography[edit]
The ecoregion covers three discontinuous areas of Jamaica. The largest area extends along the south coast of the island, from Morant Point, Jamaica's easternmost point, to Black River Bay in the west. Kingston, Jamaica's capital and largest city, is in the ecoregion. Smaller areas of dry forest occur around Negril at the western end of the island, and east of Montego Bay along the island's northern shore.
The most extensive dry forests are in the limestone hills of the Hellshire Hills in Saint Catherine Parish and Portland Ridge in Clarendon Parish in southern Jamaica. These areas are dry because they lie in the orographic rain shadow of the Blue Mountains. The Hellshire Hills have been described as one of the last substantial areas of primary, undisturbed dry forest in the Caribbean.[3] Much of the remaining Jamaican dry forest lies within the Portland Bight Protected Area[4] which includes the Portland Ridge and the Hellshire Hills, which are the best-studied areas of Jamaican dry forest.

Flora[edit]
The Jamaican dry forests are dominated by plants in the Rubiaceae, the Euphorbiaceae and the Myrtaceae.  In this regard they are similar to Puerto Rican dry forests, but differ sharply from dry forests on the mainland of South and Central America which are dominated by the Fabaceae and the Bignoniaceae.[5]  Over 271 plant species have been reported from the Hellshire Hills, including 53 species endemic to Jamaica.[6][7]  McLaren and coauthors (2005) found forests in the Hellshire Hills to be dominated by Drypetes lateriflora, Metopium brownei, Bauhinia divaricata and Krugiodendron ferreum.[8]

Fauna[edit]
The endangered Jamaican iguana (Cyclura collei) is restricted to dry forests in the Hellshire Hills.  The endemic tree frog Eleutherodactylus cavernicola, two endemic thunder snakes, Tropidophis stullae and Tropidophis jamaicensis, and the endemic blue-tailed galliwasp (Celestus duquesneyi)  are restricted to the Portland Ridge. Other endemic species present in the area include the Jamaican boa (Chilabothrus subflavus), the common snake (Typhlops jamaicensis), the Jamaican red groundsnake (Hypsirhynchus callilaemus), the Jamaican coney (Geocapromys brownii) and 11 endemic subspecies of birds.  The last Jamaican populations of the skink Mabuya mabouya are believed to be in the Hellshire Hills.

Thomas Archer (1668–1743) was an English Baroque architect. His buildings are important as the only ones by an English Baroque architect to show evidence of study of contemporary continental, namely Italian, architecture.[1]
It is said that his work is somewhat overshadowed by that of his contemporaries Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor.


Life[edit]
Archer spent his youth at Umberslade Hall in Tanworth-in-Arden in  Warwickshire, the youngest son of Thomas Archer, a country gentleman, Parliamentary Colonel and Member of Parliament, and Ann Leigh, daughter of the London haberdasher, Richard  Leigh.[2] The exact date of Archer's birth is unknown, but can be inferred from the two documentary sources that mention his age. One is an entry in the Oxford University register recording his matriculation at Trinity College on 12 June 1686, aged 17; the other, his epitaph, survives in the parish church of Hale, Hampshire. If these records are accurate, he must have been born between 12 June 1668 and 22 May 1669. Thomas is the only one of the Archer children not to have his birth recorded in the Tamworth-in-Arden parish register, which suggests he may  have been born elsewhere.[3] He attended Trinity College, Oxford, from which he matriculated on 12 June 1686.[4] After leaving university, he went on a Grand Tour, spending four years abroad and was influenced by the work of Bernini and Borromini.

Churches[edit]
Among Archer's churches was St John Evangelist, Westminster, suggestive of Hawksmoor's baroque influence.  Its four towers were originally built to stabilise subsidence.  Historians believed that was more likely than following Sir John Vanbrgh's style.  Built in 1750, St Paul's, Deptford, sweeping semi-circular porticos were not copied for a century until Smirke's magnificent church at St Mary's, Bryanston Square that dominated the street.  At St Philip's, Birmingham, now Birmingham Cathedral there was a strong sense of the Italianate Lombardic influences of High Baroque style of churches: ornate, high ceilings, with cupola and dome.  External to St Philips is the roof balustrade quite unusual in English church architecture.[5]  St John's and St Paul's were both built for the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches. John Summerson said  these two buildings "represent the most advanced Baroque style ever attempted in England".  According to the minutes of the Commissioners, Archer also "improved" Hawksmoor's designs for St Alfege's at Greenwich, although the nature of the improvements, or whether they were implemented, is unknown.[6]
At Hale,  Hampshire, he remodelled St Mary's Church, which also contains his memorial, carved by Sir Henry Cheere to Archer's own design.[7][a]

Secular works[edit]
Archer's secular works included Roehampton House, Welford Park in Berkshire, and the Cascade House and the west front and broadly bowed pilastered north front at Chatsworth House. In 1709–11 Archer designed a Baroque garden pavilion for Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent at Wrest Park, Silsoe, Bedfordshire. After 1712 Archer designed Hurstbourne Priors in Hampshire for John Wallop (later Earl of Portsmouth).
He was a founding governor of the Foundling Hospital in London in 1739, but was not involved in the construction of the resulting building, completed c. 1750. The architect for that project was Theodore Jacobsen.

Carrier is a town in Garfield County, Oklahoma, United States. The population was 85 at the 2010 census.[4]


History[edit]
The area around Carrier was first settled by farmers who moved there following the opening of the Cherokee Outlet in 1893.[5] The origin of the name "Carrier" comes from the first postmaster, Solomon S. Carrier. Buildings were constructed to serve area farmers, including businesses, a school, and a Congregational church.[5] In 1903, the Northwestern Townsite Company as the Arkansas Valley and Western Railway, which was planning to build a railway through the area, laid out a town site around a mile from the existing site, and the businesses relocated to the new location.[5] In 1904, the railway was finished.[5] The town's economy was primarily based on agriculture and the petroleum industry.[5] The town was not incorporated until 1972.[5] In the 21st century, many of the people who live in Carrier commute to work in Enid.[5]

Carrier is located in northwestern Garfield County. Oklahoma State Highway 45 runs through the center of town, leading east 9 miles (14 km) to the outskirts of North Enid and west and north 11 miles (18 km) to Goltry.

Moctezuma is the second studio album by Mexican indie rock band Porter. The album's name means "lord of lords" in the Nahuatl language while the songs tell the story of Spaniards arriving to Mexico and the fall of the Aztec Empire and the Mexica people.[2]
This is the band's first album with vocalist David Velasco.


Background and release[edit]
Porter's debut studio album, Atemahawke, was released in May 2007. The album received positive reviews and became popular due to the single "Host of a Ghost". The group performed the song at the 2008 Coachella Festival with Natalia Lafourcade.[3] Shortly after the Coachella performance, the band went on hiatus and disbanded as vocalist Juan Son started a solo career while the other members focused on finishing their education. The band announced they would be reforming when the lineup for the 2013 Vive Latino music festival was released. The band reformed with vocalist David Velasco, with Juan Son not performing with the reunited lineup for unknown reasons.
Four music videos were released to promote the album: "Palapa", "Huitzil", "Rincón Yucateco" and "La China". The narrative of the videos center around the lyrics and themes of the album.

Reception[edit]
Moctezuma was placed at number 10 on Rolling Stone's 10 Best Latin Albums of 2015.[4]

The Projeto Tóquio (Tokyo Project) is a Portuguese language term traditionally used by Brazilian media and clubs' staff and supporters in the context of winning or attempting to win the Copa Libertadores football (soccer) competition and then compete in the FIFA Club World Cup (or, previously in the Intercontinental Cup) in Japan.[1] Thus, when a club gets eliminated from the competition, it is said by the media that the team has postponed its Tokyo Project.[2] The term Projeto Tóquio was first used in 1986, during São Paulo's 1986 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A campaign, as a way to make the club more popular.[3]


History[edit]
The project normally starts after the club win the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A or the Copa do Brasil (which qualify their winner to compete in the following year's Copa Libertadores), and the clubs usually spend large sums of money to win the Copa Libertadores. In 1998, Vasco da Gama spent US$10 million to win the competition,[4] and in 1998, Palmeiras, managed by Luiz Felipe Scolari, brought Júnior Baiano among other players, and won the Copa Libertadores 1999.[5] After winning the Copa Libertadores in 1997, Cruzeiro signed some players, such as Bebeto, Gonçalves and Donizete,[6] just to play the match in Japan.[7] Vasco tried to keep the 2000 Série A and 2000 Copa Mercosur squad for the 2001 season, as part of their plan to win the 2001 Copa Libertadores and thus compete in the Intercontinental Cup.[8]
The name refers to the city where the Intercontinental Cup was contested from 1980 to 2001, which was played in Tokyo during that period.[9]

Anorexia is an album by the band Showbread. It was released on May 13, 2008 simultaneously with its companion album Nervosa. Anorexia is the first of a two-CD collection entitled Anorexia Nervosa, which is an accompaniment to the short story Anorexia Nervosa which comes packaged with the records. The album acts as a soundtrack to a read-along story book that features a chapter for each track. As the reader follows the story, the album reacts to what happens within the text. Taking a drastic new direction from their second album Age of Reptiles, which featured a more straightforward alternative rock sound, the band took "Anorexia" in a much darker, Industrial rock tone.


Story[edit]
The album and included booklet tell the story of a woman named Anorexia who begins her story by opening a center for sick and dying children. Like her sister Nervosa, Anorexia's story takes place within two texts. The first section of each chapter tells Anorexia's story in a more stylized, fairy tale-esque and metaphorical manner. Within this text, Anorexia spends the story laboring to build a tower to Heaven which parallels her quest to be remembered for her children's hospital. The subsequent text in each chapter is narrated by Anorexia herself, and takes place in real time in the actual world. While Anorexia's motives seem noble, we learn as the story continues that she is driven by a sinister, selfish desire to become immortalized and praised for her "good deeds". One night while treating a child with an unnamed illness (presumably the HIV virus), Anorexia is stabbed with a dirty syringe and infected with the same illness. As Anorexia is weakened by the disease, she becomes more infamous and her tower to Heaven becomes taller. But on her death bed she finds no solace and realizes that her great tower is merely a shallow bed of stones only feet from the ground. At this point in the story, the real time narrative ceases and the remaining chapters are carried exclusively through metaphorical means. Anorexia, dying on her bed of stones, wakes in a sunlit field and finds that she has been carried to safety by a small lamb who died in the process of rescuing her. The lamb however, resurrects and explains that he had given his life to save Anorexia simply to fulfill his lifelong desire to be with her.

Amy Becher (born May 24, 1978) is an American curler from Omaha, Nebraska.[1] In 2000, she won the United States Women's Curling Championship as vice-skip on Amy Wright's team. They went on to represent the United States at the 2000 World Women's Curling Championship.


Curling career[edit]
Becher competed at her first junior national championship in 1994, finishing last. She returned to junior nationals in 1995 and finished fourth.[1]  Becher again improved her results at the 1996 Junior Nationals, winning the championship as skip of her own team. As Team USA at the 1996 World Junior Curling Championships they finished last with a 0–9 record. In 1997 Becher joined Risa O'Connell's team at third, defended her junior national title and improved her World Juniors result by finished in fourth place at the 1997 World Juniors. She returned to the World Junior Championships a third time in 1999, as alternate on Hope Schmitt's team.
Upon moving from juniors to women's curling, Becher joined Amy Wright's team at third and found success quickly. At her first Women's National Championship in 1999, Team Wright took the silver medal when they lost to Patti Lank in the final. They again faced Team Lank in the final of the 2000 Women's Championship, this time winning with a final score of 12–9. As national champions, Becher and Team Wright earned a spot at the 2000 World Women's Championship as well as an opportunity to compete at the 2001 United States Olympic Curling Trials. At World's, they finished in a three-way tie for sixth place with a 4–5 record. During the 2001 Olympic Trials Wright felt she was not playing good enough and stepped aside, allowing Becher to take over skipping duties.[2] Despite the change in line-up, they finished in a three-way tie for last place with a 3–7 record.

Personal life[edit]
Becher's parents would bring her along to the curling club when she was young. She started curling competitively through the Ak-Sar-Ben Curling Club's juniors program.[1]
Becher graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato with a double major in chemistry and teaching.[1]

1980 NCAA Division I-A seasonNumber of teams138[1]Preseason AP No. 1Ohio State[2]Post-seasonBowl games15Heisman TrophyGeorge Rogers (running back, South Carolina)Champion(s)Georgia (AP, Coaches, FWAA)Division I-A football seasons ← 1979 1981 →
The 1980 NCAA Division I-A football season saw a university from the state of Georgia take its first national title since 1942.
Nine days following the bowl games to close the 1979 season, tragedy struck when new LSU coach Bo Rein died when the plane he was flying in crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Virginia. Rein, who coached North Carolina State to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship in 1979, was named on November 30 of that year as the successor to Charles McClendon, who coached LSU to a 137–59–7 mark from 1962 through 1979. Jerry Stovall, a former LSU All-American and St. Louis Cardinals defensive back, was named to succeed Rein approximately 36 hours after the crash.
The Georgia Bulldogs starred freshman running back Herschel Walker, who made his NCAA debut against Tennessee.  Down 15–2 at halftime, Georgia sent in Walker, the third string running back at the time, to try to light a spark.  Walker ran over All-American safety Bill Bates, in a play that would set the tempo for the rest of his career.
This year was the final season in which long time rivals Rutgers and Princeton played against each other. The rivalry between the New Jersey schools has not been played since.
This year's edition of Florida–Georgia game was won on a last-minute 92-yard pass from Georgia's own endzone, known by the play-by-play call "Run, Lindsay, run!".
The Bulldogs ran through the rest of the season unscathed, beating Notre Dame in the Sugar Bowl. Walker rushed for 150 yards against Notre Dame, a defense which had not given up a hundred-yard game that whole season. He did this with a dislocated shoulder.
The Pittsburgh Panthers also had a stellar season, led by defensive end Hugh Green.  The team went 11–1 and finished ranked No. 2, finishing the season with a rout of South Carolina and Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers in the Gator Bowl. 29 players from this team went on to play in the NFL.
Florida State defeated No. 3 ranked Nebraska on the Cornhuskers' home turf, and the following week defeated the No. 2 ranked Pitt Panthers
It was an unusual year for the Pac-10 as 5 of its 10 members were placed on probation by the conference (but not the NCAA) including traditional powers USC and UCLA, along with both Oregon schools and Arizona State. So half the conference was ineligible for bowl games and it was feared that the 4th or 5th-place finisher would end up in the Rose Bowl. Ironically,  USC and UCLA both got as high as No. 2 in the polls before being upset. As it turned out, the probation didn't matter as Washington won the conference outright with a 6–1 record.
This year's edition of the Holiday Bowl was a classic as the BYU staged a fourth quarter comeback, led by future NFL star Jim McMahon. Down 45–25 to SMU with less than four minutes left, McMahon threw three touchdown passes, including a Hail Mary as time expired, caught in the endzone by Clay Brown, despite being surrounded by three SMU defenders.


Rules changes[edit]
Offensive linemen are permitted full arm extension on so-called "retreat" blocking during pass plays, and clenched hands are permitted.
The "chop block" (a second offensive player blocking a defensive player below the knees while engaged with another offensive player) is outlawed.
A tie-breaker system was proposed for the post-season (similar to the one adopted for the 1995 post-season, except the start of overtime was at the 15–yard line and no defensive scores allowed), but failed to gain acceptance by the bowls.
Facemasking now includes grabbing the helmet as well as the facemask.

September[edit]
Most of the top teams of 1979 were expected to have strong seasons again in 1980. The preseason AP Poll had a top five of No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Alabama, No, 3 Pittsburgh, No. 4 USC, and No. 5 Oklahoma, all of whom had finished undefeated or with one loss the previous year. Georgia, which had gone just 6–5 in 1979, started at No. 16.
September 6: No. 2 Alabama was the first top-five team to begin its schedule, winning 26–3 over Georgia Tech. The other teams at the top of the poll had not begun their seasons; the next poll changed only slightly, with No. 1 Ohio State, No. 2 Alabama, No. 3 Pittsburgh, No. 4 Oklahoma, and No. 5 USC.
September 13: No. 1 Ohio State hosted Syracuse and won 31–21. No. 2 Alabama was idle. No. 3 Pittsburgh defeated Boston College 14–6, No. 4 Oklahoma beat Kentucky 29–7, and No. 5 USC won 20–17 at Tennessee. The AP voters shuffled the teams around somewhat: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Oklahoma, No. 4 USC, and No. 5 Pittsburgh.
September 20: No. 1 Alabama defeated Mississippi 59–35 in a game arranged independently from the official SEC schedule. No. 2 Ohio State shut out Minnesota 47–0. No. 3 Oklahoma was idle. No. 4 USC won 23–13 over No. 20 South Carolina. No. 5 Pittsburgh defeated Kansas 18–3, but still fell out of the top five. No. 6 Nebraska impressed the voters with a 57–0 blowout of Iowa and moved up several spots in the next poll: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 Oklahoma, and No. 5 USC.
September 27: Whilst both teams had no national ranking, the final meeting between college football's maiden rivalry occurred in Piscataway, New Jersey, as the Rutgers Scarlet Knights upended the Princeton Tigers 44–13. As both institutions have gone in opposite directions, no attempts to revive the first rivalry have transpired, nor will likely happen.
No. 1 Alabama blanked Vanderbilt 41–0. No. 2 Ohio State won 38–21 over No. 20 Arizona State. No. 3 Nebraska visited No. 11 Penn State and came away with a 21–7 victory. The first of the top teams to lose was No. 4 Oklahoma, which fell 31–14 at home to John Elway and Stanford. No. 5 USC won 24–7 at Minnesota. No. 7 Texas shut out Oregon State 35–0 and moved into the top five in the next poll: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 USC, and No. 5 Texas.

October[edit]
October 4: No. 1 Alabama recorded their second consecutive shutout, 45–0 over Kentucky, but the teams behind them were not as successful. No. 2 Ohio State was shut out at home by No. 11 UCLA, 17–0. No. 3 Nebraska was also upset at home, losing to No. 16 Florida State 18–14 on a fumble at the Seminoles’ three-yard line with 12 seconds left. No. 4 USC almost met a similar fate, but pulled out a 23–21 victory against Arizona State. No. 5 Texas won 41–28 at Rice. No. 6 Pittsburgh beat Maryland 38–9 and returned to the top five in the next poll: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Texas, No. 4 Pittsburgh, and No. 5 UCLA.
October 11: No. 1 Alabama had a surprisingly tough time with unheralded Rutgers, but the Tide prevailed 17–13. No. 2 USC won 27–10 at Arizona. No. 3 Texas met No. 12 Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout and dealt the Sooners another loss, 20–13. No. 4 Pittsburgh lost by a score of 36–22 to No. 11 Florida State, the Seminoles’ second consecutive win against a top-four opponent. No. 5 UCLA defeated No. 16 Stanford 35–21. No. 7 Notre Dame won 32–14 against No. 13 Miami. Three of the Irish's four wins had been over ranked teams, and they moved up in the next poll: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Texas, No. 4 UCLA, and No. 5 Notre Dame.
October 18: No. 1 Alabama bounced back with another shutout win, 27–0 at Tennessee. No. 2 USC got bogged down in the rain at Oregon and had to settle for a 7–7 tie. No. 3 Texas and No. 4 UCLA were idle. No. 5 Notre Dame dominated Army 30–3. No. 6 Georgia, who had been slowly moving up in the poll with a mixture of narrow wins and blowouts (three of their six wins were by a touchdown or less, and the other three were by more than 30 points) defeated Vanderbilt 41–0 and moved up in the next poll: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 Texas, No. 3 UCLA, No. 4 Notre Dame, and No. 5 Georgia.
October 25: No. 1 Alabama won 42–7 over No. 20 Southern Mississippi. No. 2 Texas fell to SMU by a score of 20–6, and the Longhorns would end up losing five of their last seven games after a 5–0 start. No. 3 UCLA defeated California 32–9 on the road. No. 4 Notre Dame won 20–3 at Arizona. No. 5 Georgia registered a second straight shutout by defeating Kentucky 27–0. No. 6 Florida State, whose only loss was by a single point to Miami, beat Memphis 24–3 to move into the top five: No. 1 Alabama, No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Notre Dame, No. 4 Georgia, and No. 5 Florida State.

November[edit]
November 1: After five straight weeks with at least one major upset, this may have been the craziest day of all. No. 1 Alabama, which had held the top ranking for six weeks and was riding a 28-game winning streak, was knocked off by Mississippi State, 6–3; similar to the earlier Nebraska-Florida State game, the favored team lost on a late fumble at the three-yard line. No. 2 UCLA heard the news of Alabama's loss, but the Bruins could not take advantage, falling 23–17 to Arizona in Tucson. No. 3 Notre Dame shut out Navy 33–0. No. 4 Georgia squeaked past No. 14 South Carolina 13–10 in a matchup between star running backs Herschel Walker and George Rogers. No. 5 Florida State crushed Tulsa 45–2, No. 7 USC blew California out 60–7, and No. 8 Nebraska defeated No. 15 Missouri 38–16. The next poll featured No. 1 Notre Dame, No. 2 Georgia, No. 3 Florida State, No. 4 USC, and No. 5 Nebraska.
November 8: The madness continued as new No. 1 Notre Dame was held to a 3–3 tie by Georgia Tech, who would finish with a 1–9–1 record. For the second week in a row, the second-ranked team struggled after being notified that the team above them had lost. No. 2 Georgia trailed rival No. 20 Florida late in the game when QB Buck Belue hit WR Lindsay Scott on an out pattern; Scott turned up field and went 90 yards for the winning score in the season's most memorable play. It was Scott's only touchdown reception all season and it gave the Bulldogs a 26–21 win, making them the only undefeated and untied team in the nation. The other top teams had less trouble. No. 3 Florida State defeated Virginia Tech 31–7, No. 4 USC won 34–9 at Stanford, No. 5 Nebraska beat Kansas State 55–8, and No. 6 Alabama won 28–7 over LSU. The next poll featured No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Florida State, No. 4 Nebraska, and No. 5 Alabama.
November 15: No. 1 Georgia won 31–21 at Auburn, the first game of the season where their winning margin was more than 7 but less than 30; the victory clinched the SEC title and a Sugar Bowl berth for the Bulldogs. For the fifth week in a row, a top-two team suffered an upset, as No. 2 USC lost at home to Washington, 20–10, moving the Huskies into first place in the Pac-10. No. 3 Florida State was idle, beginning an unusual three-week layoff before their last game. No. 4 Nebraska shut out Iowa State 35–0. No. 6 Notre Dame went down to Birmingham and beat No. 5 Alabama 7–0. No. 7 Ohio State, who had started at the top of the poll and still had only one loss, beat Iowa 41–7 and finally returned to the top five: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Notre Dame, No. 3 Florida State, No. 4 Nebraska, and No. 5 Ohio State.
November 22: No. 1 Georgia and No. 3 Florida State were idle, while No. 2 Notre Dame won 24–10 over Air Force. No. 4 Nebraska and No. 9 Oklahoma met to decide the Big 8 title and the Orange Bowl berth, and for the second straight year the underdog Sooners narrowly upset the Cornhuskers (this time winning 21–17 on a touchdown with less than a minute to play). No. 5 Ohio State and No. 10 Michigan squared off in their usual showdown for the Big Ten championship, and once again the underdog won a close game, with the Wolverines prevailing 9–3. Michigan's Rose Bowl opponent would be No. 16 Washington, who clinched the Pac-10 title with a 30–23 win over Washington State. No. 6 Pittsburgh and No. 7 Penn State were idle as they prepared for their rivalry game, but both teams moved into the top five after the Nebraska and Ohio State losses: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Notre Dame, No. 3 Florida State, No. 4 Pittsburgh, and No. 5 Penn State.
November 28–29: No. 1 Georgia completed their undefeated season with a 38–20 win over Georgia Tech. No. 2 Notre Dame and No. 3 Florida State were idle. No. 4 Pittsburgh faced No. 5 Penn State, and the Panthers’ defense led the way to a 14–9 victory. No. 6 Oklahoma had finished its season, but the Sooners moved up in the next poll: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Notre Dame, No. 3 Florida State, No. 4 Pittsburgh, and No. 5 Oklahoma.

December[edit]
December 6: The season ended with one final upset as No. 2 Notre Dame, whose only previous blemish was their tie against Georgia Tech, fell 20–3 to No. 17 USC. No. 3 Florida State, the only other highly ranked team which had not finished its schedule, defeated No. 19 Florida 17–13. No. 6 Michigan moved up one spot in the final regular-season poll: No. 1 Georgia, No. 2 Florida State, No. 3 Pittsburgh, No. 4 Oklahoma, and No. 5 Michigan.
The major bowls extended their invitations in mid-November when there were still games left to be played, which led to problems for some of the top-ranked teams. Predicting that Notre Dame would defeat USC and finish undefeated, the Sugar Bowl organizers arranged for a meeting between the Fighting Irish and Georgia, which would have been a No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown. The early invitation, combined with Notre Dame's late-season loss, cost Florida State (the actual No. 2 team in the final poll) a chance to play in a de facto national championship game. The Seminoles ended up in an Orange Bowl rematch against Oklahoma, who had defeated them in the same event the previous year.
The other unfortunate team was Pittsburgh, which was shut out of the New Year's Day bowls despite a No. 3 ranking and a 10–1 record (their only loss being to Florida State). The Cotton Bowl organizers invited No. 9 Alabama to face No. 6 Baylor (who earned the automatic bid as the SWC champion) before the Panthers had obtained their resume-building win over Penn State. Since the Rose Bowl was contracted to feature the Big Ten and Pac-10 winners, the Panthers had to settle for a Gator Bowl bid against No. 18 South Carolina and Heisman Trophy winner George Rogers.

Daniel J. Levinson (May 28, 1920 – April 12, 1994), a psychologist, was one of the founders of the field of positive adult development. Levinson is most well known for his theory of stage-crisis view, however he also made major contributions to the fields of behavioral, social, and developmental psychology. His interest in the social sciences began with studies on personality and authoritarianism, and eventually progressed to studies on development.[1] Greatly influenced by the work of Erik Erikson, Elliott Jaques, and Bernice Neugarten, his stage-crisis view sought to incorporate all aspects of adult development in order to establish a more holistic approach to understanding the life cycle. In doing so, Levinson discussed the various developmental tasks and/or crises that one must address within each stage as well as how they contribute to the progression of development.[2][3] Although much controversy surrounds his research methods, Levinson interviewed both men and women to uncover concrete patterns that occur within similar age ranges. Through these studies, he determined that men and women essentially progress through the same cycle of life, however they differentiate in what he refers to as "The Dream". He published his findings and theory within his two major books, The Seasons of a Man's Life and The Seasons of a Woman's Life; both of which remain as influential publications within the field of psychology.[4] Being both simple in nature and open to further investigation, Daniel Levinson's legacy and lasting contributions are mainly to theory and entail profound implications for social as well as behavioral psychology.[1]


Professional life[edit]
Daniel Levinson was born on May 28, 1920, in New York City, New York.  He began his studies of the social sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, whereat he completed his dissertation on ethnocentrism in 1947.[1] Following this, he conducted research on personality, specifically authoritarian personalities at Berkeley and Western Reserve University.[1] In 1950, Levinson shifted his career to Harvard University, and began to examine the interaction between personality and organizational settings.[1] While at Harvard, Levinson worked with colleagues including Erik Erikson, Robert White, Talcott Parsons, Gordon Allport, and Alex Inkeles.[1] Also during his 12 years at Harvard, Levinson published around 36 articles and books in a wide variety of topics, including personality and institutional policy, foreign policy, professional identity, mental health administration, and social change.[1]
Levinson further advanced his academic career at Yale University from 1966 to 1990.[1] During this time, Levinson shifted his research attention to adult development.[1] Levinson worked with colleagues including Charlotte Darrow, Edward Klein, Maria Levinson (his wife with whom he had two children), and Braxton McKee while at Yale, and his research focused on interviewing 40 middle-aged men about their lives.[1] Using the information gathered from these interviews, Levinson wrote the book The Seasons of a Man’s Life. Following this, he conducted a similar study for women, and wrote The Seasons of a Woman’s Life shortly before his death in New Haven, Connecticut, on April 12, 1994.[1] Judy Levinson, his second wife, collaborated with Daniel Levinson on The Seasons of a Woman’s Life and she continued his work after his death.[5]

Research & Theory[edit]
Stage-crisis view[edit]
Levinson created his theory of stage-crisis view by conducting extensive interviews of men and women aged 35 to 45 and looking for common patterns throughout their lives.[4] From his research, Levinson described specific stages of life from childhood to old age, each of which he suggested has a developmental task or crisis that needs to be resolved. Levinson believed that the pre-adulthood stage, early adulthood transition, early adulthood stage, midlife transition, middle adulthood stage, late adulthood transition, and late adulthood stage made up a person's life.[6] Levinson also believed that the midlife crisis was a common and normal part of development.[6] The stage-crisis theory has been criticized due to Levinson's research methods. Levinson studied men and women who were all in the same age group, making his results and conclusions subject to cohort effects.[2]

Theory of men and women[edit]
Levinson believed that the main difference between men and women was “The Dream,” which refers to one’s vision for his or her future life, including goals and desires.[4] Based on findings from his interviews with men and women, Levinson argued that men and women form different types of dreams for their lives: men typically dream about occupation, while women, who have more trouble forming their dreams, are torn between dreams of occupation and dreams of marriage and family.[4]

Personality[edit]
Levinson’s studies on personality began with his first publication in 1950 entitled  “The Authoritarian Personality,” which established a set of criteria whose purpose was to define personality types by ranking and rating various individual traits using the F-scale personality test.[7] He continued to research personalities while at Berkeley, however when he arrived at Harvard he instead began to study the interaction between personality and organizations.[1] In his 1959 publication entitled, “Role, personality, and social structure in the organizational setting,” Levinson sought to investigate the various roles within a social structure, their interaction with one another, and the extent to which they are influenced by and effect one's personality. He suggests that role definition is multifactorial and thereby based on both intrapersonal and environmental contexts. The intrapersonal factors that determine one’s definition and consequences of their role include their conception of the profession as well as their conception of self. Although important in establishing individualization, role definition cannot be complete without a conception of reality and the overall social structure.[8] He goes on to state that neither aspect alone is enough to create a role definition; that in order to completely understand the nature of role definition, “we need the double perspective of personality and social structure.”[8] Levinson continued his studies of personality interactions within social institutions throughout his years at Harvard, and simultaneously published many articles as well.[1]

Accomplishments[edit]
Major contributions[edit]
Levinson's two most prominent publications were his series of books entitled, The Seasons of a Man's Life (with Maria H. Levinson, Charlotte N. Darrow, Edward B. Klein and Braxton McKee) and The Seasons of a Woman's Life. Although controversy surrounds his publications, both books remain promising and highly influential within the field of psychology. His book, The Seasons of Man's Life contains his most well-known theory as well: the stage-crisis view. Throughout this theory, he encompasses a multidisciplinary approach which has allowed him to contribute greatly to the understanding of the entirety of life cycle. The Seasons of a Man's Life was the first to be published, whereby he continued follow-up studies on women and their development throughout the life cycle.[1] Levinson died before completion, however his wife Judy Levinson continued his studies which were ultimately described in his second book of the series, The Seasons of a Woman's Life.[5]

Legacy[edit]
Daniel Levinson died on April 12, 1994, in New Haven, Connecticut. Throughout his lifetime, he conducted various studies by which he made lasting contributions to both the study of development and personality. Although most well known for his stage-crisis theory of development and life structure, his studies on personality and social structure entailed many implications for both behavioral and social psychology as well. While conducting his personality studies at Harvard, he received a National Institute of Mental Health Career Investor grant and 10 years later, upon leaving Harvard, he received a Career Development Award as well. Together these awards gave him an opportunity to continue his research at Yale, which ultimately led to his work on adult development. While his stage-crisis theory remains a controversial one, his book The Seasons of a Man’s Life endures as an important contribution to the understanding of the human life cycle. Due to his broad range of influence and simple ideas, Levinson’s legacy lies mainly in his theory.[1]

Sinemorets Hill (Halm Sinemorets \'h&lm si-ne-'mo-rets\) is the second most prominent (after Hesperides Hill) in the chain of hills surmounting Bulgarian Beach in eastern Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica.
Sinemorets Hill is 380 m long in east-west direction and 230 m wide, with twin heights, the west-southwestern one being 64 m and the east-northeastern one 62 m, sheltering a small pool between them. It is snow free in the summer months and overlooks the Bulgarian base to the southwest. Relics of an old encampment were still discernible at its eastern slope in 1996.
Sinemorets is the name of a village and a cape on the Black Sea coast. The hill was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1994 at the request of the Second Bulgarian Antarctic Expedition (1993/94).


Location[edit]
The peak is located at 62°38′25″S 60°21′42″W﻿ / ﻿62.64028°S 60.36167°W﻿ / -62.64028; -60.36167, which is 820 m east-northeast of Hespérides Point, 220 m inland from Greenpeace Rock, 1.2 km northwest of Krum Rock and 970 m north-northeast of Atlantic Club Ridge.  Mapped in detail by the Spanish Servicio Geográfico del Ejército in 1991, Bulgarian mapping in 1996, 2005 and 2009.

Armadillidium nasatum, the nosy pill woodlouse, is a large, Western European-based species of woodlouse that has been introduced to North America, along with Armadillidium vulgare also found in other parts of Europe.


Description[edit]
Morphological comparison between Armadillidium nasatum and A. vulgare
Armadillidium nasatum can reach lengths of up to 21 millimetres.[2][5] Like Armadillidium depressum, it does not form a complete ball when enrolled.[2] Though similar in outwards appearance to Armadillidium vulgare in dark grey color, the main distinguishing feature is a rectangular-like protrusion ("nose") towards the apex of the head. The tail (telson) has a rounded tip with incurved sides, as opposed to most genus Armadillidium species which have a smaller, flat tail.[5] Pale longitudinal stripes spanning from head to rear are seen on some individuals, though this is variable and is not a diagnostic feature.[6]




A. nasatum: note the "nose" and large telson



A. vulgare: no "nose" and smaller telson


Distribution[edit]
Armadillidium nasatum occurs in patches in southern England, with concentrated areas in its range and sporadic occurrences in Ireland.[2] It lives in dryer areas than most woodlice, is synanthropic, and is frequently found in non-inhabited areas such as railway lines and industrial waste ground.[2] Like other woodlice, it is found under stones and wood.

Subspecies[edit]
There are five recognized subspecies in the species Armadillidium nasatum:[1]

Armadillidium nasatum flava Colinge, 1989
Armadillidium nasatum mehelyi Verhoeff, 1930
Armadillidium nasatum nasatum Budde-Lund, 1885
Armadillidium nasatum nigrescens Collinge, 1918

The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio (Song of the Battle of Hastings) is a 20th-century name for the Carmen Widonis, the earliest history of the Norman invasion of England from September to December 1066, in Latin. It is attributed to Guy, Bishop of Amiens, a noble of Ponthieu and monastically-trained bishop and administrator close to the French court, who eventually served as a chaplain for Matilda of Flanders, William the Conqueror's queen. Bishop Guy was an uncle to Guy I, Count of Ponthieu, who figures rather prominently in the Bayeux Tapestry as the vassal of Duke William of Normandy who captured Harold Godwinson, later to become King Harold II of England, in 1064.


History and background[edit]
The Carmen is generally accepted as the earliest surviving written account of the Norman Conquest[citation needed]. It focuses on the Battle of Hastings and its immediate aftermath, although it also offers insights into navigation, urban administration, the siege of London, and ecclesiastical culture. It is in poetic form, 835 lines of hexameters and elegiac couplets, and is preserved only in two twelfth-century copies from St Eucharius-Matthias in Trier, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 10615-729, folios 227v-230v, and Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 9799-809 (the latter containing only the last sixty-six lines).[1]
The Carmen was most likely composed within months of the coronation of William I as king of England (on Christmas Day, 1066) – probably sometime in 1067, possibly as early as Easter of that year, to be performed at the royal festivities in Normandy, where King William I presided. The motivation for the poem's production and performance is open to debate.  Queen Matilda may have commissioned the Carmen as an entertainment and to memorialize her husband's conquest, as queens customarily commissioned works of history composed by clerics, and Guy d'Amiens was known in the court of her father, Count Baldwin V of Flanders, where the bishop had witnessed a charter in 1056 with Earl (later King) Harold, Count Guy of Ponthieu, and Count Eustace of Boulogne.  This theory is suggested by the work praising the allies from France, Boulogne, Ponthieu, Brittany, Maine, and the new Norman kingdom in Apulia, Calabria and Sicily.  All the allies would have attended the Easter celebrations for the sharing-out of war booty.  In 1066 Bishop Guy may have sought to win royal esteem, possibly damaged by the involvement of Hugh of Ponthieu in the death of King Harold and the senior family's attempts to assassinate the young duke in childhood. Bishop Guy himself was out of favour with the pope, and it has been suggested that he wanted to garner some Norman influence by writing the Carmen in William's honour and inviting Lanfranc of Pavia, abbot of Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen and later Archbishop of Canterbury (to whom the Proem of the poem is dedicated) to use his influence with king and pope. A further possibility (though none of these are mutually exclusive) is that Guy composed the Carmen to present Eustace, Count of Boulogne, in a favourable light in order to reverse King William's banishment of Count Eustace following his failed invasion of England in the autumn of 1067 (Eustace remained in fact out of favour until late in the 1070s).
The Carmen possesses exceptional historical importance as an early account of the Norman Conquest. It is the most vivid of the original written accounts and practically the only one to give a non-Norman point of view in detail. The Bayeux Tapestry is problematic; the identity and  purpose of its creators is unknown, though it bears evidence of English involvement (eg. English spelling) in its production.[2] In fact, it is the Carmen's very vividness which has caused it in the past to come under attack as either a forgery, fraud or at the least a later, 12th-century source. Frank Barlow argued that the Carmen was most likely from the year 1067, and following Elisabeth van Houts' arguments in her article "Latin Poetry and the Anglo-Norman Court 1066-1135: The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio," this is the commonly accepted scholarly opinion.[3] The Carmen is notable for literary reasons, too. It describes the Norman Conquest in terms borrowed from classical and Carolingian epic and praise poetry, but in ways that contrast with other contemporary praise poets. The ironic application of classical and Carolingian language to William sows doubt about his faithfulness and piety (two core political values for the Carolingians and the Capetians). This indicates that the contradictions and early weaknesses of William's conquest and regime were already apparent in 1067, even as Guy could praise William for his achievement.[4]

Ed Dur, also known as Al Dour and Ad Dour (Arabic: ٱلدُّوْر, romanized: Ad-Dūr, lit. 'The Houses')[1][2] is an Ancient Near Eastern City, today located in Umm Al Quwain, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).[3] One of the largest archaeological sites in the emirates,[4] comprising an area of some 5 km2 (1.9 sq mi), the coastal settlement overlooks Al Beidha Lake. One of the most important archaeological finds in the UAE, and closely associated with the inland trading centre of Mleiha, Ed Dur has been dubbed 'one of the most significant lost cities of Arabia'.[5]


Discovery[edit]
Ed Dur was first discovered by an Iraqi archaeological team in 1973, and dug in 1974,[4] but formal archaeological exploration only commenced in 1989.[6] Subsequent digs have unearthed evidence of human habitation spanning the Ubeid period, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Pre-Islamic period. During the latter period, the settlement appears to have been at its most prosperous, and the hills of the area were entirely covered with dozens of buildings, many more areesh or palm-frond buildings and thousands of stone-built tombs. Some 500 of these tombs have been excavated,[4] with grave goods discovered including drinking sets, Roman glass, weaponry, pottery, jewelry and ivory objects.[7] It is thought some 20,000 tombs are on the site in all.[8] In the digs carried out between 1989 and 1995 alone, over 1400 found objects were recorded and no fewer than 13,000 diagnostic sherds.[6] During later work at Ed Dur, at the end of March 2019, 15 tombs, bronze statues, settlement remains, jewellery and pottery, dating back to the 1st century CE, were unearthed at the site.[2][9]
Ed Dur was, in its prime, the largest - and thought to be the only - coastal port of significance in the southern Gulf.[6] Situated some 120 km from the Straits of Hormuz, occupation of the site from the Neolithic through to the Iron Age was followed by a period of desertion. From the 3rd to 1st century BCE, northeast Arabian trade dominated Ed Dur, giving way to southeastern Arabian traders. This period of trade saw Ed Dur emerge as a major port.[6]
Of the many discoveries made at Ed Dur, the use of alabaster window panes is significant, the first recorded such use in the Arabian Peninsula.[10] Ceramic finds at the site are mostly glazed ware, likely of Parthian origin and imported from southern Mesopotamia or south-western Iran. The more elaborate burials at Ed Dur are similar to those found at Assur, in northern Mesopotamia - which are Parthian. Black-on-orange painted 'Namord ware' is indicative of trading links across the Strait of Hormuz to Persia and Baluchistan, while Indian red polished ware also points to links east.[10]

Graeco-Roman links[edit]
A Tetra Drachma of the type found in large quantities at Ed-Dur. Finds of coin moulds in Mleiha matching these coins show they were minted there, between 100-200 CE.
It is thought that Ed Dur is the site of Omana, mentioned by both Pliny and Strabo as an important town in the Lower Gulf.[10] The city is referred to in the anonymous Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a documentation of trade between Alexandria and India, and the Periplus indicates that Omana was the most important port in the Gulf during the first century CE and was linked with the port of Apologos (al-Ubulla) at the head of the Gulf, which has been linked to Basra. This trade down the Gulf, via camel trains inland from the Gulf to Syria would explain the richness of finds of Roman materials at Ed Dur.[11] Contemporary Greek manuscripts have given the exports from Ed Dur as 'pearls, purple dye, clothing, wine, gold and slaves, and a great quantity of dates'.[5]
Continuing evidence of millennia of trade between southeastern Arabia and the various civilizations of Mesopotamia is found at Ed Dur, with Characene coins from the reign of Attambelos III to VI, as well as a small number of Nabatean coins from the reign of Aretas IV found at the site. Aretas ruled from approximately 9 BCE to 40CE.[6]
The site has been associated with the inland historical development of Mileiha in the Emirate of Sharjah, with which it is thought to have had strong ties.[12] Similarities in burial rituals — of laying animals to rest with their owners — and vessels, decorations and small bronze snake figures have also been unearthed.[7] Camels buried with their heads reversed are a common feature of both the animal burials at the coastal city of Ed Dur and Mleiha inland.[13]
Ed Dur had a rich trading past, with artefacts found at the site showing links both with Mesopotamia and India.[3] Macedonian style coinage unearthed at Ed Dur dates back to Alexander the Great,[4] while hundreds of coins have been found featuring a head of Heracles and a seated Zeus on the obverse, and bearing the name of Abi'el in Aramaic. These coins match coin moulds found at Mleiha,[14] and are in fact unique to the two sites.[6] Their dating to 100 AD, when Ed Dur was in its prime, is complicated by similar coins found in Bahrain in a hoard dated to 200 BC. It is thought that Abi'el lived on in coinage much as Alexander did on coins minted centuries after his death.[14] The Abi'el coins found at Ed Dur comprise some 70% of the total hoard there. Attesting to the regional trade through Ed Dur, coins from Roman (Augustus and Tiberius), Eastern Mediterranean (Nabataean, Gaza), southern Mesopotamian (Characene), South Arabian (Hadramawt), Persian (Parthian and Persis) and Indian sources were found.[6]

Fort[edit]
First unearthed by the Iraqi archaeological team in 1973, the fort at Ed Dur was undoubtedly the focus of political power. Four walls some 20 metres (66 feet) in length connect four towers, each some 4 metres (13 feet) in diameter. The fort was constructed mainly from beach rock. South of the fort is the Sun Temple.[15]

Sun Temple[edit]
One of the reasons for Ed Dur's importance is the discovery of a temple to the Sun God Shams/Shamash,[6] which has been compared to the Great Temple of Hetra in Iraq, also known as the "Temple of the Sun", dating back to the same period.[3] The temple was originally by a Belgian expedition in 1987, but has been damaged since by erosion. In early 2016 a project was undertaken to restore the temple to its 1980s state.[16] A rectangular building, its main gate is located to the east and is preceded by columns mounted with Corinthian capitals. Two gates within the temple lead respectively to the main building and its courtyard. The temple differs from the Hetra Temple in the simplicity of its architecture and the geometric decorations to its external plaster. A pair of stone eagles, uncovered during an Emirati dig in 2015, are thought to have originally decorated the temple entrance. A simple stone altar that was probably used for offering or sacrifice was found inside the temple.[4]
The exterior walls of the temple are decorated in a style linked with the late Iron Age Eastern Mediterranean, consisting of alternating squares and rectangles with projecting panels. This pattern has also featured on the outside walls of a 1st Century temple at Hermopolis, in Egypt and in Pompeii, and is viewed as relatively common in the ancient world of that period.[6]
A rectangular basin, located in the north-east corner of the building, sits on a broad base with a 8-line inscription in Aramaic, of which only a sole word can now be deciphered, "Shamash", a reference to Shams, or the Sun deity.[8] A fire pit, some 2.7 m (8.9 ft) across and 1 m (3.3 ft) deep, has led to speculation of the use of fire in religious ritual.[3] While Aramaic was in common usage in eastern Arabia from the 3rd/2nd century BCE onwards, Shamash was the major deity of the Parthian Arab city of Hatra, today located in present-day eastern Nineveh Governorate in northern Iraq.[6] Although the site at Hatra was extensively damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which occupied the area in mid-2014,[17] damage to the site was less than at other Iraqi archeological sites.[17]
The temple was to have been the subject of a programme of conservation undertaken in 2016 by the Umm Al Quwain Department of Tourism and Antiquities, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development and the regional office of the UN-affiliated International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property, but as of 2019, the temple building was still open to the elements and deteriorating as a consequence.[18]

Terrebonne is a provincial electoral district in Quebec, Canada that elects members to the National Assembly of Quebec.  It consists of most but not all of the city of Terrebonne.
It was created for the 1867 election (and an electoral district of that name existed earlier in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada).
In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, it lost part of the city of Terrebonne to the L'Assomption electoral district.

Southwestern Indian Polytechnic InstituteSouthwestern Indian Polytechnic InstituteTypePublic tribal land-grant community collegeEstablished1971Parent institutionBureau of Indian AffairsAcademic affiliationsSpace-grantPresidentDr. Tamarah PfeifferUndergraduates488[1]LocationAlbuquerque postal address, New Mexico, United StatesCampusurban/suburban reserveWebsitewww.sipi.edu
Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) is a public tribal land-grant community college in unincorporated Bernalillo County, New Mexico,[2] with an Albuquerque postal address.[3] It is federally operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and funded through the Bureau of Indian Education, both agencies within the United States Department of the Interior. More than 120 different Indian Tribes are represented in SIPI's student body.[4][5]


History[edit]
The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute was conceived by the All Indian Pueblo Council, who envisioned a post-secondary school that could serve the Native American community. Collective efforts with tribal leaders, public officials, and interested citizens resulted in the school's founding in 1971; dedication ceremonies were held on August 21, 1971. September 16, 1971, was the first day of classes. It operated initially on an "open-entry, open-exit system" of individualized training. It was funded by the Bureau of Indian Education, within the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
In 1974, SIPI was awarded a citation for Excellence of Service. By 1975, SIPI was accredited at the Certificate Level by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.[6]
In 1994, the college was designated as a land-grant college, together with  31 other tribal colleges.[7]
It lost its accreditation in July 2010 and had been designated a "candidate" by the Higher Learning Commission.[8] On March 12, 2014 SIPI was awarded "Initial Accreditation" by the Higher Learning Commission.[9]

Campus[edit]
SIPI is in unincorporated Bernalillo County, New Mexico,[2] with an Albuquerque postal address.[3] It is adjacent to northwest Albuquerque.[10]
SIPI is located on approximately 164 acres (66 ha) of land. SIPI is located in the center of New Mexico’s agricultural and high-tech corridors (Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, and Intel Corporation), major universities and the largest technical force within a 500-mile radius. SIPI's state-of the-art Science and Technology Center includes 12 research and teaching laboratories, 10 classrooms, two distance learning rooms, a 500-seat auditorium, faculty offices and conference rooms.[10]

Partnerships[edit]
SIPI has agreements with the University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico Highlands University to ensure better recruitment, transfer, and retention rates for Native Americans so that students may easily transfer to four-year and graduate programs. The college has also established agreements with regional public institutions outside of New Mexico.[11]
SIPI is a member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), which is a community of tribally and federally chartered institutions working to strengthen tribal nations. SIPI was created to serve higher education needs of American Indians. SIPI generally serves geographically isolated populations who do not have ready access to higher education.[12]
The institute lost its accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission in July 2010.[13] On March 12, 2014, SIPI was awarded "Initial Accreditation" by the Higher Learning Commission and is once again accredited by the agency.[14]

Fishman
Personal detailsBorn1953 (age 70–71)Hoboken, New JerseyAlma materRutgers UniversityNew York University School of Law
Ralph Joseph Marra Jr. (born 1953) is an American lawyer who served as the Acting United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey. He held this position from the resignation of Chris Christie in December 2008 until the appointment of Paul J. Fishman in October 2009. In January 2010, after Christie became Governor of New Jersey, Marra was appointed to a top legal position in the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. After serving about a decade, he became senior counsel at Calcagni & Kanefsky, LLP in Newark, New Jersey.[1]


Early life[edit]
Marra's father was an Italian immigrant who settled in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1930. The family moved to Totowa, New Jersey, and Marra attended Passaic Valley Regional High School, which serviced Little Falls, Totowa, and West Paterson (now Woodland Park).[2]
Marra received a B.A. degree from Rutgers University and a J.D. degree from New York University School of Law. He was admitted to the New Jersey bar in 1978.[3]

U.S. Attorney's office[edit]
In 1985, Marra joined the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey as an assistant U.S. Attorney. He worked in the Special Prosecutions Division, focusing on the investigation and prosecution of public corruption. From 1997 to 2002 he served as senior litigation counsel. Marra prosecuted former Newark Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson and two associates on federal bribery charges. Gibson pleaded guilty to tax fraud in 2002.[4]
In 2002, United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie named Marra as his first assistant.[4] He served as lead attorney in the prosecution of State Senator Wayne R. Bryant on corruption charges. Bryant was convicted on all counts in November 2008.[5]
Marra continued as first assistant U.S. Attorney until December 1, 2008, when Christie resigned to pursue the Republican nomination for Governor of New Jersey. Marra became Acting U.S. Attorney upon Christie's resignation, serving until a permanent replacement was selected by President Barack Obama.[5] On June 4, 2009, Obama nominated ex-federal prosecutor Paul J. Fishman to the position.[6][7] Fishman was sworn into office on October 14, 2009.[8]

Operation Bid Rig[edit]
On July 23, 2009, Marra announced the arrests of 44 people, including several high-profile New Jersey elected officials, as part of Operation Bid Rig,  a major sting operation stemming from a two-year investigation into money laundering and political corruption.[9][10]  On August 18, the Associated Press reported that Marra was facing an internal Justice Department investigation for his public comments at the time of the arrests, in order to determine if his comments could be construed as an implicit endorsement of Christie's gubernatorial candidacy.[11]

Christie administration[edit]
In November 2009, Internet news sources reported that Chris Christie planned to appoint Marra as Attorney General of New Jersey following his inauguration in January 2010.[12][13][14] Instead, on December 15, 2009, Christie announced his intention to nominate Essex County Prosecutor Paula Dow as Attorney General.[15]
On February 18, 2010, Marra was appointed to the position of senior vice president for legal and governmental affairs for the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.[16]
Marra resides in Cranford, New Jersey with his wife Sharon and is a registered Democrat.[2][5]

La Bostonnais is a municipality in the Mauricie region of the province of Quebec in Canada. The community is about 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) north of La Tuque's town centre along Quebec Route 155.
The municipality takes its name from the nearby Bostonnais and Little Bostonnais Rivers. This name probably came from an American man originally from Boston who joined the Abenaki at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1823, a reference was made to an Abenaki man named Jean-Baptiste Bostonnais who had one of his daughters baptized at Trois-Rivières. The Bostonnais family had their hunting territory in the area where the namesake rivers flow.[1]


History[edit]
The area, located within the geographic township of Bourgeoys, opened up for colonization around 1871. The Mission of Saint-Jean-Bosco was formed in 1946 and became a parish two years later. In 1946, the post office opened, and closed again in 1961.[1]  It was constituted as a municipality in 1987.
On March 26, 2003 it became part of the City of La Tuque as part of the early 2000s municipal reorganization in Quebec, but following a 2004 referendum, the Municipalities of La Bostonnais and Lac-Édouard were reconstituted on January 1, 2006.[1]  It remains part of the urban agglomeration of La Tuque.  It had formerly been part of Le Haut-Saint-Maurice Regional County Municipality, which was abolished in the wake of the merger; after demerger, it is one of the few municipalities (other than in the Nord-du-Québec region) that is not part of any regional county municipality.

Maes pils logo
Maes pils is a Belgian pils brewed by Alken-Maes.  The beer was first produced in 1930 for Antwerp's Universal Exposition and called Prima Maezenbier.  After Jupiler and Stella Artois, it is the third best-selling pilsner in Belgium.
In 2008, Alken-Maes was taken over by the Dutch Heineken Brewery. 
In 2009, Alken-Maes changed the recipe of Maes Pils, resulting in a slight change in taste and a rise in the percentage of alcohol from 4.9% to 5.2%. To mark the change, Maes was rebranded with a new logo, a new embossed bottle, and a new descriptive slogan: "Extra Mout/Extra Malt". 

Summary[edit]
Alcohol: 5.2% ABV
Available in 25 cl, 33 cl and 75 cl bottles or in 25 cl, 33 cl and 50 cl cans. Can also be found in 5 litre kegs.

Victoria Jepson (born 23 February 1987) is an English professional football coach and manager who is currently the senior assistant head coach of Women's Super League club Tottenham Hotspur, where she was previously the club's assistant coach and had a spell as interim head coach. She managed Liverpool in both the WSL and Women's Championship from 2018 to 2021.


Career history[edit]
Liverpool[edit]
She started working at Liverpool in 2009 holding various roles including coaching across the entire elite girls pathway from u11s up to the u21s squad whilst holding coach education courses with the Premier League abroad in Indonesia, China, Hong Kong and Qatar .[1] In addition she has worked for The FA at their girls' excellence camps which help to develop the country's best younger players. In 2014, Jepson was nominated for the FA Female Development Coach of the Year, and won the award the following year after transitioning several youth players into the senior Liverpool FC Women's Squad.[2]
Jepson was appointed assistant manager to Neil Redfearn at Liverpool in June 2018. After just one game, Redfearn departed the club, leaving Jepson as part of the interim managerial team headed by Chris Kirkland.[3] On 26 October 2018, Jepson was appointed as first team manager on a permanent basis.[4] Jepson's first game in charge was a 1–0 victory against Hope Powell's Brighton Hove Albion. Liverpool finished the season 8th out of 12 teams in the league.
The following season, Liverpool were relegated from the Women's Super League on sporting merit after The FA Board's decision to award places on a points-per-game basis following the curtailment of the season eight games early due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Liverpool had won one game, picking up six points from 14 games during the 2019–20 FA WSL.[5]
She continued with the team following relegation until, on 12 January 2021, Liverpool announced that Jepson had left the club by mutual consent with the team sat in third place in the Championship.[6]

Tottenham Hotspur[edit]
Jepson joined Tottenham Hotspur as assistant coach to Rehanne Skinner in July 2021.[7] In March 2023, she was named interim head coach following the firing of Skinner.[8] Jepson was appointed senior assistant head coach to Robert Vilahamn at Tottenham on 26 July 2023.[9]

Personal life[edit]
Born in Macclesfield, Jepson attended Macclesfield College and coached at Macclesfield Town.[10]

Bell tower in Ann Arbor, Michigan, US
The plaque on Burton Tower
The Burton Memorial Tower is a clock tower located on Central Campus at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor at 230 North Ingalls Street. Housing a grand carillon, the tower was built in 1936 as a memorial for University President Marion Leroy Burton (presidency: 1920–1925). This carillon is the world's fourth-heaviest, containing 53 bells and weighing a total of 43 tons.


History[edit]
The monument was constructed in 1935 and finished in 1936. It stands at 192 feet, with the floor of the bell chamber at 120 feet from the ground. It is located at the University of Michigan campus, and is used for housing education offices. The high-rise tower was designed in an interesting mixture of Art Deco and art moderne architectural styles, constructed with a reinforced concrete shell faced with limestone over a plan 42 feet (13 m) square. The design was greatly influenced by Eliel Saarinen, who had submitted an earlier scheme. At the top is the 43-ton, 53-bell Baird Carillon. The tower chimes the Westminster Quarters every quarter hour in the key of E-flat.
While this building houses a memorial carillon, it is primarily a conventional high-rise, contains classrooms for the University of Michigan's school of music, and houses offices for the department of musicology and ethnomusicology and for the University Musical Society.
The Burton Memorial Tower was designed by Albert Kahn, who also designed the William L. Clements Library, Angell Hall, and Hill Auditorium for the University of Michigan. Its carillon was donated by Michigan alumnus Charles A. Baird, a lawyer and the first U-M athletic director, and has been christened the "Charles Baird Carillon". Baird had the bells cast in England and gave them to the university. He also commissioned “Sunday Morning in Deep Waters”, the fountain on Ingalls Mall between Burton Tower and the Michigan League.
After University of Michigan Regent Sarah Goddard Power committed suicide by jumping to her death from the eighth floor of Burton Tower in 1987, slight modifications were made to the structure, such as the addition of stops to prevent windows from opening more than a few inches.
The University of Michigan campus has two of only twenty-three grand carillons in the world, barely two miles apart. The other is housed at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Tower on the North Campus.

On April 8, 2017, in celebration of the university's bicentennial, the tower was illuminated in maize and blue, the university's colors. The carillon and spire can also be lit in other colors by the LED illumination system installed for the bicentennial.

Karate-do[edit]
Nakamura practiced with Shoshin Nagamine and was also influenced by Shinyei Kyan and Jokei Kushi who were both senior students in Nagamine's dojo. For a number of years, Nakamura was the senior instructor at Nagamine's honbu dojo in Naha, Okinawa.[1]

Legacy[edit]
Nakamura profoundly influenced and inspired what is taught in Shōrin-ryū Kishaba Juku and developed and founded by his students Chokei Kishaba and Katsuhiko Shinzato.[1][2]

South Carolina's center of population is 2.4 mi (3.9 km) north of the State House in the city of Columbia.[2]
According to the United States Census Bureau, as of 2017, South Carolina had an estimated population of 5,024,369, which is an increase of 64,547 from the prior year and an increase of 399,005, or 8.6%, since the year 2010. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 36,401 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 115,084 people.
According to the University of South Carolina's Arnold School of Public Health, Consortium for Latino Immigration Studies, South Carolina's foreign-born population grew faster than any other state between 2000 and 2005.[3] The Consortium reports that the number of Hispanics in South Carolina is greatly undercounted by census enumerators and may be more than 400,000.[3][4]

South Carolina’s population increased by 15.4 percent between 1990 and 2000 and by another 7.4 percent between
2000 and 2005; 11.6 percent of that increase has been attributed to immigration, primarily from Mexico and Latin America. Most work in the construction industry, with another proportion in agriculture, in addition to processing factories. The Latino population has increased considerably faster in South Carolina and the Southeast than for the United States as a whole.[5]
The five largest ancestry groups in South Carolina identified by respondents to the US census are African American (29.5%), American (13.9%), English (8.4%), German (8.4%), and Irish (7.9%) (thus a total of more than 39% from northern Europe).[6]
From 1720 until 1920, African slaves and their descendants made up a majority of the state's population. (See census data below.) Whites became a majority in the state after that date, following the migration of tens of thousands of blacks to northern industrial cities in the Great Migration. In the 21st century, most of the African-American population in the state lives in the Lowcountry and the Midlands areas, historically areas of their greatest concentrations of population.[citation needed]
6.6% of South Carolina's total population were reported as under 5 years old, 25.2% under 18, and 12.1% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 51.4% of the population in 2000. Those who self-identify as having American ancestry are of mostly British Isles ancestry: English and Scots-Irish stock.[citation needed]

Birth data[edit]
Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

City and MSAs[edit]
South Carolina's metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) are much larger than their central city population counts suggest. South Carolina law makes it difficult for municipalities to annex unincorporated areas, so city proper populations look smaller than is reflected in the total metropolitan populations.
For example, Myrtle Beach has a municipal population of less than 50,000 persons, but its MSA has more than 200,000 persons. Anderson's municipal population is smaller than Sumter's, but the Anderson MSA is larger, as seen below.
Columbia, Charleston, and Greenville all have urbanized area populations between 400,000 and 550,000, while their metropolitan statistical area (MSA) populations are each more than 600,000. The Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson MSA population consists of approximately 1.4 million people, making it the largest in the state and third largest in the Carolinas.

Religion[edit]
St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church in Charleston is the tallest house of worship in the state. Its spire rises 255 feet.
South Carolina residents are majority Protestant Christian, with a lower percentage of people claiming no religious affiliation than the national average. The religious affiliations of the people of South Carolina are as follows:

Christian: 78%
Protestant: 65%
Evangelical (e.g., Southern Baptist Convention): 35%
Mainline Protestant (e.g., United Methodist Church): 15%
Historically Black (e.g., African Methodist Episcopal Church):[clarification needed] 15%
Roman Catholic: 10%
Other Christian: 3%
Other Religions: 3%
Non-Religious: 19%[18]
Sephardic Jews have lived in the state for more than 300 years,[19][20][21] especially in and around Charleston. Many came from London, where they were merchants.[22] Until about 1830, South Carolina had the largest population of Jews in North America, most in Charleston. Some have married and assimilated into Christian society; in the 21st century, less than 1% of the total religiously affiliated people are Jewish. The proportion of Roman Catholics in the state has been increasing given migrants from the North and immigration from Latin America.

Historical demographics[edit]
Beginning in 1790, the United States Census Bureau collected the population statistics of South Carolina. The years listed prior to that are estimates and exclude the Native American population. From 1790 until 1860, the designated demographic classifications were   white,   black slave and   free black.

Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.
Following the Civil War, the racial groupings were   white,   black and   other.

Desmognathus is a genus of lungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae known as dusky salamanders.[1][2] They range throughout the eastern United States as far west as Texas, and north to southeastern Canada.[1]


Characteristics[edit]
Species of the genus Desmognathus have a unique jaw-opening mechanism where the lower jaw is stationary and the skull swings open.[3] There are additional stalked condyles, an atlanto-mandibular ligament, along with other skeletal and musculature features that have evolved to accompany this type of jaw-opening mechanism.[3] Additionally, they are known to exhibit maternal care by brooding over their eggs.[3] An unidentified Desmognathus species as seen in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, TN.

Paul Fentener van Vlissingen

Paul Fentener van Vlissingen (21 March 1941 in Utrecht – 21 August 2006 in Langbroek) was a Dutch businessman and philanthropist who was CEO of SHV Holdings for three decades. He contributed to the development of game reserves in Africa and purchased the Letterewe estate in Scotland in 1978. He pledged the right to roam there prior to the passage of the Scottish Land Reform Act of 2003.[1]


Early life and background[edit]
Paul Fentener van Vlissingen was the youngest son of Frits Fentener van Vlissingen II. The van Vlissingen family was a leading Dutch industrialist family whose fortune was based on shipping coal on the Rhine in the 19th century.[2] Paul's father, described as one of the "fathers of the Dutch economy", had co-founded SHV Holdings through a merger with eight other Dutch trading families in 1896 and later bought out most of the other families.[3] Originally Europe's largest coal wholesaling business, SHV is the largest privately owned company in the Netherlands.

Career at SHV Holdings[edit]
Paul inherited a significant shareholding in the company SHV Holdings from his father and studied economics at the University of Groningen before joining SHV. In May 1974, he joined the SHV board and he succeeded his brother, Frits III, as chairman in 1980.
Paul led SHV as chief executive officer for three decades from the mid-1960s. Under his leadership the company diversified into new areas ahead of the collapse of the coal market in the 1960s. The areas he became involved with included retail, through the Makro and Otto Reichelt chains of grocery supermarkets and cash & carries, and energy, through the acquisitions of liquified petroleum gas companies including Calor Gas in the UK and Primagaz in France. He also diversified into scrap metal, recycling, oil exploration, renewable energy and private equity. In 1995 he stepped down and then served as non-executive chairman.
Fentener van Vlissingen had a maverick and unconventionally philosophical leadership style. He allowed young managers whom he trusted to establish Makro operations in overseas markets, giving them unusual amounts of autonomy. He recognised the possibility of global warming as early as the early 1990s and had a love for cryptic aphorisms. In 2001 he wrote a book discussing his business experiences directing a large multi-national conglomerate entitled Ondernemers zijn ezels, which can be translated as Entrepreneurs are Jackasses. He followed this up in 2002 with a book entitled Overstekende ezels, translated Crossing Jackasses. In this second book he discussed his views regarding entrepreneurs, corruption, ambition, the euro, money, honesty, change and success.

Philanthropy and conservation[edit]
Fentener Van Vlissingen was recognised as a conservationist and contributed to the development of game reserves in Scotland, South Africa, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia. In 1978 he bought the wild and roadless 85,000 acres (340 km2) Letterewe estate in Wester Ross, and in 2006 was described as the largest foreign landowner in Scotland.[4] "I don't call myself the owner," he said of Letterewe. "You can't own a place like this. It belongs to the planet. I'm only the guardian of it." The Letterewe Accord, an agreement that gave ramblers freedom of access to the entire Letterewe estate in exchange for a pledge to respect the land, predated the Scottish Parliament's own right-to-roam legislation by over a decade. 
He was known for the "habit of inviting everyone, whether landowners, journalists, birdwatchers or ramblers, to visit the estate and talk about issues face to face."[5] He sometimes saddled a pony with a week's provisions and disappeared into the hills, staying at a bothy without lights or a toilet.[5] He also proposed reintroducing wolves and lynx to this estate.[6]
After a near fatal brush with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1980, he founded the Van Vlissingen Cancer Fund, which is now one of the major cancer fundraisers in the Netherlands.
From 1994 until his death, his home was the Conholt Park estate in Wiltshire, England, on the border with Hampshire. Here, too, he applied sustainable land management and nature conservation.[5]
Van Vlissingen was also a great supporter of Scottish Gaelic and in 2006 donated £250,000 to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic college on Skye.[7]

Death and legacy[edit]
In April 2006, van Vlissingen announced that he had terminal pancreatic cancer and that he would not be having chemotherapy. He said: "In the Western world we mistakenly try to keep death at bay. I look to Native Americans instead. When they see their death approaching, they visit good friends and family to share happy memories and look back at the good things."
In an interview with the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf published in April 2006, he said: "Our planet is in a much sorrier state than it was when I was a child. The destruction cannot go on at this pace. My generation should be ashamed of the condition in which we are passing on our planet to future generations."
In August 2006, the cancer got worse and led to his death on the night of 20–21 August 2006. The news of his death was released to the public on 22 August.
In February 2006 it emerged that in his will Fentener van Vlissingen left a significant portion of his estate to his partner, the former Guardian art critic Caroline Tisdall, as well as several million to his lover, the Dutch businesswoman Suzanne Wolff. The Scotsman reported that Tisdall had been prepared to tolerate the billionaire's relationship with Wolff in his latter years. He left the bulk of his fortune and the Letterewe Estate in north-west Scotland to his two daughters, Alicia and Tet, and to their children.[citation needed]
Frits III, his eldest brother, died in March 2006. John, the middle brother, is the last of the three brothers alive.

The East Des Moines Industrial Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in the East Village of Des Moines, Iowa, United States, directly east of the Downtown Des Moines area. At the time of its nomination it consisted of 45 resources, which included 31 contributing buildings, four contributing sites, three contributing structures, six non-contributing buildings and two non-contributing structures.[3] It also includes the Northwestern Hotel, which was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The historic district was listed on the NRHP in 2017.[1] The district's boundaries were increased in 2023 to include another building.[2]
The period of significance is c. 1874, when the oldest building in the district was built, to 1956. It is a rare-surviving group of manufacturing, warehousing, and railroad-related properties in the city.[3] In 1957 plans for what is now Interstate 235 were announced. Urban Renewal districts were added to this area in subsequent decades, which brought an end to investment in the district. The contributing buildings are the last remaining warehouse and manufacturing buildings that are left on the near east side of Des Moines.[3] The contributing structures include two railroad bridges and a pump house and the contributing sites are the locations of extant or former railroad rail bed and rail siding segments. The district's "buildings, structures, and sites that show variety in architectural appearance, materials, and technological progression reflective of the period of significance."[3]

Gianmarco Zigoni (born 10 May 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie C Group A club Virtus Verona.


Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Raised in Oderzo, Zigoni started playing football with local team Opitergina, before joining Treviso's youth system, where he scored more than one hundred goals.[1] He made his professional debut with the club in a Serie B game against Ancona on 26 January 2009, aged 17. The match ended in a 2–1 loss for Treviso, with Zigoni scoring their lone goal.[2] He scored his second goal only four days later, in a 3–2 win against Brescia.[3] The young striker went on to make a total of 18 appearances for Treviso in the 2008–09 season, being included 8 times in the starting line-up.[4]

AC Milan[edit]
Coming to the attention of several Serie A clubs, such Fiorentina, Inter Milan and Juventus,[4] Zigoni was eventually signed by AC Milan at the beginning of the 2009–10 season, for €1.3 million.[5][6] He became a regular of their youth team, scoring a total of 19 goals in league and cup games.[7] In particular, he scored in both legs of the Coppa Italia Primavera final, as Milan defeated Palermo 3–1 on aggregate to lift the trophy 25 years after the club's last success in the competition.[8]
As for the first team, Zigoni made only one appearance during the season. He came off the bench in the final minutes of a league game against Lazio, which ended in 1–1 draw, on 28 March 2010.[9]

Genoa[edit]
In July 2010, Zigoni was transferred to Genoa in co-ownership for €3.75 million,[10] as part of the deal that saw defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos join Milan.[11] With the youth team of his new club Zigoni scored two goals in the Supercoppa Primavera, as Genoa defeated 5–0 his former Milan teammates to secure the trophy.[12] However, he failed to get any first-team appearances in his first months at the club.
Subsequently, on 29 January 2011, Zigoni was sent out on loan to Serie B club Frosinone.[13] In his short stint with the club, he made a mere six appearances with a single goal, and Frosinone ended being relegated to the third tier at the end of the season.

AC Milan return and loans[edit]
On 24 May 2011, AC Milan re-acquired the second half of Zigoni from Genoa for the same fee,[14][15] before being sent on loan to Avellino for the season. Next season he was sent on another loan spell to Serie B club Pro Vercelli.[16] However, during the January transfer window he was called back and sent on a second loan spell to Avellino.[17] Avellino promoted to Serie B at the end of season.
On 29 July 2013 he was signed by Italian third division club U.S. Lecce,[18] re-joining teammate Giacomo Beretta and Marcus Diniz. Next season, he moved to Monza, once again on loan.[19] On 8 January 2015 Zigoni was released by Monza.[20] He was signed by SPAL on loan.[21] The loan was extended on 13 July 2015,[22] and again on 15 July 2016.[23]

Venezia[edit]
On 10 August 2017, Zigoni was signed by Serie B side Venezia, on a season-long loan deal with an obligation to buy.[24]

Serie C[edit]
On 19 September 2020 he joined Novara on loan.[25] On 30 January 2021 he was sub-loaned to Mantova.[26]
On 31 January 2022, Zigoni was sold to Serie C club Virtus Verona on a permanent transfer.[27]
On 9 September 2022, Zigoni moved to Juve Stabia on a one-season contract.[28]
On 24 August 2023, Zigoni returned to Virtus Verona for one year.[29]

International career[edit]
Zigoni won his first international cap in February 2009, shortly after his debut in Serie B with Treviso, being called up by Italy U-20 for a game against Austria.[30] Italy lost 2–1, with Zigoni himself scoring their lone goal.[31]
Zigoni went on to be selected also at under-18 and under-19 level, being capped a total of 10 times and scoring 5 goals.[32] Among the 5 goals, 3 of them was from 3 substitute appearances in 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship qualification. However Zigoni was dropped out from the squad for the elite round and the final tournament as the team already had Mattia Destro, Fabio Borini and Nicolao Dumitru as centre forwards.

Personal life[edit]
Zigoni was born in Verona, the son of former Juventus, Roma, and Hellas Verona striker Gianfranco Zigoni and grandnephew of former Napoli midfielder Pierluigi Ronzon.[1]

Agriculture[edit]
As of 2010[update], Diglipur's chief agricultural products were rice (about 6500 ha), coconuts (3600 ha), rabi pulses (2900 ha), areca nuts (1300 ha) and bananas (650 ha).[1]

Tourism[edit]
The city also profits from tourism to nearby attractions in North Andaman, which include the Ross and Smith islands, the Saddle Peak National Park, the beaches at Ram Nagar, Kalipur, and Lamiya bay, and mud volcanoes. Ram Nagar beach (15 kilometres (9.3 miles) away from Kalighat) is famous for sea turtle nesting from December to February.[2]
The first hydroelectric power station of the islands (5.25 MW) is set up in the Kalpong River.
The Chalis Ek Caves (about 20 kilometres (12 miles) due south of Diglipur, near the village of Pathi Level) and the Alfred Caves are a major nesting ground for the edible-nest swiftlet, whose nests are exported to China for bird's nest soup.

Mud Volcano at Diglipur[edit]
The mud volcanoes at North Andaman are described by locals as better than those found in Baratang Islands. The mud volcanoes at North Andaman are located at a place locally known as Jal Tikry near Hathi level around 25 kilometres (16 miles) from Diglipur Bazaar (direction towards Laxmipur). Till now local administration has made no efforts of accessibility of tourists to this place.

Ross Island[edit]
The small Ross Island, a 20-minute boat ride from Aerial Bay jetty, is an ideal spot for beach tourism, adventure (trekking through tropical forest), research / education (like scuba diving, snorkeling, turtle nesting). The sand bar joining this island with the larger Smith Island is an added attraction. This Ross Island is not to be confused with the Ross Island, South Andaman district, near Port Blair.

Smith Island[edit]
Smith Island offers a similar experience to the small adjoining Ross Island. Smith Island has a village of about 60 families. Eco rest houses are available for overnight stay. The beach is notified for turtle nesting during seasons.

Kalipur Beach[edit]
At a distance of 18 kilometres (11 miles) from Diglipur, there is a combination of sand and rock shores with fishing village nearby. Lamiya Bay is quite near the Kalipur beach. Kalipur Adventure Sports Complex, near Kalipur Beach offers water adventure sports such as speed boats, water scooters etc. The complex however suffers administrative apathy and requires facelift. Lamiya Bay Beach (or locally Lemiyar Bay) borders the Saddle Peak National Park | National Parks |. This beautiful beach has a stretch of shore covered with shells. At the end of this walk is a refreshing fresh water stream 'Thambu Nali' in the foothills of National Park.

Saddle Peak National Park[edit]
Is a dense tropical forest housing a rich bank of exquisite trees, (including sandal), rare flora and wild fruits and offering trekking opportunities including climbing up natural steps formed by the roofs of old trees. Tourists need to take permission from Forest Department to trek through this Park.
A 740 feet climb leads to Saddle Peak, the highest point in A&N islands which offers an aerial view of A&N, the second peak "ice degree peak" is the coldest point while the third peak provides a fantastic view spanning Diglipur to Mayabunder.

Tourists[edit]
The tourist season in North Andaman [Diglipur] is between the months of November and March in a year. The present tourist inflow in a season is an estimated 1000 only of which ~90% are domestic tourists and the rest foreign nationals. This translates to a low average of 6 tourists per day in season. The average stay period of a foreign tourist is put at 10 days to a fortnight and the same drops to 1–3 days in case of a domestic tourist.

Local travel in North Andaman[edit]
For local travel STS buses (Govt.) and private buses are available. The public transport services run between 04:30 and 19:30 hours. There are also about 45 autos and few jeeps/Omni Vans as an alternative to public transport on the island. Fishermen doongis (locally called donghy, dinghy/machine donghy) are available for inter-island travel. Charges for these doongis have to be negotiated. Doongis may not be to everyone's liking as they are uncomfortable and makes a loud monotonous noise. They are usually open-top and without any life rafts or jackets and therefore unsafe for sea travel as well.
The inter-island boat visit to Aerial Bay jetty thrice in a week, Monday, Wednesday & Saturday, departs from Port Blair 07.00 Hrs & arrives 15.15 Hrs, and returns Tuesday 07.00 Hrs, Wed & Sat 21.00 Hrs.

Power supply[edit]
Power supply to this island is from the 5.5 MW hydro electric project of NHPC. The present power supply situation is satisfactory with occasional power cuts due to stabilization problems in the plant. The present capacity is said to be sufficient to meet the power requirements of Diglipur, Mayabunder and Rangat islands. The Kalpong River project has a 34- meter high concrete dam on the left fork of the river Kalpong, a  25-metre-high (82-foot)  rock-fill dam on the right fork, 257-metre-long (843-foot) in-take approach channel, and a 133-metre long in-take tunnel. The Kalpong river traverses in the northward direction for a length of about 35 kilometres (22 miles) before it joins the Aerial Bay Creek on the east coast near Diglipur

Water supply[edit]
Water supply is from the perennial Kalpong river, the only river in the whole of A&N islands. The water supply situation is satisfactory till date. However, construction of dam for hydro electric project has raised concerns on sustainability of maintaining the present water supply levels.

Villages[edit]
In 2001, the townships (gram panchayats) and subordinated villages in Diglipur county were:[1]

Launcelot Jefferson Percival KVCO (22 May 1869 – 22 June 1941)[1] was an Anglican priest who in addition to various parish posts served in the Ecclesiastical Households of Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, King Edward VIII and King George VI.
Percival was also a noted sportsman in his early adult life and was an international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Oxford University and Rugby. Percival played international rugby for England and was an original member of invitational team, the Barbarians.


Personal history[edit]
Percival was born in Clifton, Bristol in 1869 to John Percival and Louisa Holland.[2] He was educated at Clifton College,[3] of which his father was headmaster. Percival followed his father later in life when he matriculated to Trinity College, Oxford,[4] as after leaving Clifton, John Percival had taken the role of President of Trinity College.
Percival left university with a master's degree and took Holy Orders. By 1899 he was resident chaplain to the Bishop of London, and on 28 February 1899 he was appointed an Honorary Priest in Ordinary to Queen Victoria, his first entry into the monarch's Ecclesiastical Household.[5] By 1905 he was also rector of St James's Church, Fulham and on 3 November he was promoted to Priest in Ordinary to the king.[6] In 1910 he became the rector of St Mary's, Bryanston Square in London.[7] On 6 January 1922 he was appointed Precentor of the Chapel Royal,[8] and on 6 February 1923 domestic chaplain to the king.[9] On 3 March 1924 he was appointed Chaplain of the Venerable Order of Saint John.[10] In 1931 Percival was made Deputy Clerk of the Closet (and sub-almoner),[11] and on 20 July 1936 was reappointed to the post after the accession of Edward VIII[12] and again on 2 March 1937 under George VI after Edward's abdication.[13] In the 1936 New Year Honours he was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.[14] In 1937 he was appointed Precentor of the Chapel Royal for the second time,[15] this time he held the post until his death in 1941.[16] He was succeeded by Revd Wallace Elliott.
The National Portrait Gallery in London holds two photographs of Percival, both taken in 1931 by one of Alexander Bassano's photographic studios.[17]

Rugby career[edit]
Percival with the 1889 Oxford Varsity team, Percival is standing on the far left on the back row
Percival first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Oxford University whilst studying at Trinity. Although a forward, Percival had a good reputation for scoring tries, mentioned as scoring twice for an invitational priest's team in George William Erskine Russell's 1921 collection of essays Afterthoughts[18] and in the 1891–92 season for Oxford scored a "remarkable try" against Blackheath when he dribbled the ball almost the entire length of the pitch before punting the ball over the opposing fullback to score.[19]
One of Percival's most notable matches for Oxford was the 1889 encounter with the touring New Zealand Native football team. The match was played on 21 February, Oxford winning 6–0.[20]
Percival played in two Varsity Matches against Cambridge University in 1889 and 1891 to win his sporting 'Blues'. His first Varsity game ended in victory, with Oxford winning by a goal and two tries to nil, Percival scoring one of the tries after a scrummage close to the Cambridge line.[21] Percival was absent from the 1890 team, after being forced to stand down after an accident,[22] but returned to the Oxford squad in 1891. Oxford began the 1891 game as favourites, with a very strong forward pack in tremendous form, but lost the match to late Cambridge pressure.[23]
In the 1890/91 season Percival was approached by William Percy Carpmael to join his newly formed invitational team, the Barbarians. In accepting, Percival became one of the founding members of the team.[24] The same season, Percival was first selected for the England national rugby team, brought into the squad as a replacement for Richard Budworth. His debut was against Ireland in the second England encounter of the 1891 Home Nations Championship; the game ended with a comfortable victory for the English team. Despite the win, Percival was replaced for the next game of the tournament, but was called upon again for the 1892 Championship, again against Ireland. The game ended in another win for England, and Percival scored his first and only international points when he scored a try, thanks to some good build up play from Sammy Woods and Frank Evershed.[25] His third and final international game was in 1893, but having left Oxford University he was now representing Rugby at club level. Played against Scotland, Percival was on the losing side with England for the first time, though he became the first player to win a cap playing from Rugby.[26]
Percival played for several seasons for Rugby and was instrumental in bringing in several talented players to the club.[27] In the 1892/93 season, Percival was given the captaincy of the club for one season, replacing T. B. Sparkes.[28]

Cricket career[edit]
Percival also played cricket at a high level. He represented both Marylebone Cricket Club and Herefordshire County Cricket Club and in 1895 while representing Herefordshire he was bowled out in both innings by J. T. Hearne.[29]

Albert Lynch, A Young Beauty With Flowers In Her Hair, oil on panel
A bouffant (/buːˈfɒnt/ boo-FONT) is a type of puffy, rounded hairstyle characterized by hair raised high on the head and usually covering the ears or hanging down on the sides.


Etymology[edit]
The word bouffant has its etymological origin in the French word bouffante, which is the present participle of the French verb bouffer, meaning to puff or fluff up. In Spanish, it can be translated as "esponjar" or "mullir".[1] The bouffant was also known in England during the 1960s as teasy-weasy, as that was the popular name for Raymond Bessone, a British stylist credited with the revival of the bouffant hairstyle in the 1950s.[2][3]

History[edit]
Drawing of a Gibson Girl by Charles Dana Gibson (c. 1891)
The bouffant is a variant of the pouf hairstyle from the 18th century, popularly used in the aesthetics of aristocratic society and the upper socio-economic classes of the French Empire. The bouffant, along with similar hairstyles like the pouf and the pompadour, represented an exclusive hairstyle of the upper socio-economic classes. The hairstyle was typically created in aristocratic wigs, which were adorned with feathers, ribbons, flowers, and jewelry, and accompanied by various headpieces, hats, and fascinators.[4] Voluminous hairstyles like the bouffant and the pompadour became popular again among high society women in the late Victorian era, where full-bodied hair was considered an attribute of the upper socio-economic classes, leading to the use of cosmetic solutions and hairpieces to add volume to the hairstyle.[5]
At the end of the 19th century, the bouffant style found appreciation during the Belle Époque period. The hairstyle was revived through the concept of feminine beauty created by American illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, who popularized the aesthetic of the Gibson Girl as one of the first forms of pin-up beauty in the late 19th century. The iconic Gibson Girl was often depicted in contemporary fashion, wearing figure-accentuating clothing, hats, and headpieces, and portrayed with voluminous bouffant and pompadour hairstyles.[6] The sophisticated perception of women in the Gibson Girl model contributed to the popularity of this aesthetic, including the bouffant hairstyle, until the period of World War I.[7]

20th and 21st centuries[edit]
Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife (1867-1931) with her daughters Princess Maud (1893-1945) and Princess Alexandra (1891-1959), ca 1911.
After the political succession from the reign of Queen Victoria to King Edward VII, the bouffant continued to be a symbol of aristocracy in the early years of the Edwardian era, marked by the integration of new hairstyling techniques such as the use of hair waxes, fixatives, and hairpieces to add volume to the hairstyle.[8] The bouffant and the Gibson Girl aesthetic were later replaced by modern versions of new femininity, which included the bob hairstyles and the flapper woman's style.[9]
The bouffant hairstyle made a comeback in the early 1950s during the rockabilly aesthetic, along with the pompadour hairstyle.[10] Its revival in women's fashion in the 1950s is credited to British stylist Raymond Bessone. The hairstyle was often referred to as teasy-weasy due to the popularity of Bessone's bouffant hairstyle, which became its commonly known name.[2]

Jacqueline Kennedy in the Diplomatic Reception Room, December 5, 1961, White House, Diplomatic Reception
The popularity of the bouffant hairstyle in the 1950s was greatly strengthened in the United States when the First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, frequently appeared with a low bouffant in the form of a bob cut.[11] The hairstyle became the traditional look for American housewives in the 1960s as it was often used to create a taller appearance for the wearer. With this intention, a variation of the bouffant known as the beehive emerged. The beehive consisted of a voluminous mass of hair styled in a roll or hive-like shape resting on top of the crown of the head, characterized by its considerable height and often accompanied by bangs.[12] The beehive hairstyle became iconic for artists like Dusty Springfield and in more modern times, for the look sported by Amy Winehouse.[13]

During the 1960s, the bouffant gained notable popularity among musical personalities, especially members of girls groups performing R&B, bubblegum pop, soul, and doo-woop music. Some groups that adopted the bouffant in the 1960s included The Supremes, The Ronettes, The Shirelles, and Martha and the Vandellas. This popularity contributed to a significant increase in sales of hair rollers and hairspray during the 1960s.[3]
The revival of the beehive hairstyle is recognized to have emerged with the fame of Amy Winehouse in the 2000s.[13] The bouffant (including its variation, the beehive, and the pompadour hairstyle) experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 2010s due to the aesthetic influence of the hipster subculture as well as retro rockabilly trends, with music personalities like Adele and Rihanna sporting these hairstyles.[14]

Method[edit]
Hair on the top of the head was often raised by backcombing or "teasing" it with a comb to create a pile of tangled, loosely knotted hair on the top and upper sides of the head. Then, unteased hair from the front of the head was lightly combed over the pile to give a smooth, sleek look, and the ends of the outer hair might be combed, cut, curled, or flipped in many distinctive ways.[15]
In some cases, a small wiglet or a cushion of nylon mesh might be used instead of or in addition to teasing, to add height at the crown of the head.[16] Bangs might be worn over the forehead, or a long switch or "fall" of artificial hair, matching the wearer's own hair color, might be added at the back.[17]
Usually, hair spray or hair lacquer was applied as a finishing touch to stiffen the hairdo and hold it in place without the need for hairpins. Since the hair could not be brushed without ruining the style, adjustments were made by using the long, pointed end of a "rattail" comb to gently lift the hair back into place.[18]

The Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye (Ottoman Turkish: قوای انضباطيّه, lit. 'Forces of Order'; Turkish: Hilafet Ordusu, lit. 'Caliphate Army') was an army established on 18 April 1920 by the imperial government of the Ottoman Empire in order to fight against the Turkish National Movement during the Turkish War of Independence in the aftermath of World War I. It was commanded by Süleyman Şefik Pasha.


Establishment[edit]
Sensing the situation, Sultan Mehmed VI charged his minister of war, Şevket Süleyman Paşa, with the establishment of an irregular force to exterminate the Nationalists. Realizing he could no longer count on the title "Sultan" alone to influence the Turkish people, he considered it necessary to use the timeless and spiritual title of "Caliph" for the leader of the army - thus depicting Nationalists not only as the enemies of the Sultanate but also as the enemies of God. The British supported the Kuvâ-i İnzibâtiyye with the aim of enforcing British policy in the region and of stabilizing the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. Supported by the British, the Sultan began a propaganda war throughout the country. Relayed by imams, he urged the Turks to take up arms against the Nationalists of General Mustafa Kemal, presented as the enemies of God.

Dissolution[edit]
The defeat of the Army of the Caliph, a sign of the end of the influence of the Ottoman Sultan in Turkey, ended the civil war and heralded the beginning of the War of Independence against the occupying nations, which culminated in the victory of the Nationalists and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.

Drawing showing oil income versus how it is used under the budgetary rule
The budgetary rule[1] (Norwegian: handlingsregelen) is a rule concerning the usage of capital gains from The Government Pension Fund - Global of Norway. The rule states that a maximum of 3% of the fund's value should be allocated to the yearly government budget. Its main stated justification is to avoid the Dutch disease in the Norwegian economy due to the large influx of oil-sourced revenue. It is believed that the fund will grow with more than 3% yearly over time, which makes it possible to allocate up to 3% to the yearly budget without decreasing the value of the fund.
The rule was introduced in 2001 during the First cabinet Stoltenberg, and has a broad cross-party support.
The rule was last changed from 4% to 3% February 2017. Every party in the parliament was in favour of the change, except the right wing Progress Party (Norway).

Guaranty Bank was a major bank based in Austin, which collapsed in 2009.[2] It was formed in 1988[3] as part of Temple-Inland and in 2007 became a standalone company. At the time of its collapse, Guaranty was the second largest bank in Texas, with 162 branches across Texas and California,[4] and had $13 billion in assets and held $12 billion in deposits.[2] Major shareholders included billionaire investor Carl Icahn and hotel tycoon Robert Rowling, who jointly invested $600 million in the bank in 2008.[3][5]


History[edit]
Guaranty Bank's origins date to 1938, when a charter was issued to the Guaranty Building and Loan in Galveston, Texas which operated as the Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1988, Temple-Inland formed Guaranty by acquiring three financial institutions: Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association, Delta Savings Association and First Federal Savings and Loan.[1][3] It expanded from Texas into California in the 1990s, acquiring Stockton Savings Bank and Hemet Federal Savings & Loan.[6] [7][8]
In November 2007, Temple-Inland announced that it planned to separate itself into three stand-alone public companies.  Shareholders in the original company would eventually receive stock in all three companies depending on the amount owned on the day the company split-up. The three companies were:[9]

Temple-Inland Inc.
Guaranty Financial Group Inc.
Forestar Real Estate Group Inc.
Guaranty Financial Group Inc. became a standalone financial services holding company that operated in various business segments through its primary operating subsidiaries, "Guaranty Bank" and "Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc."  Guaranty Bank became a federally chartered savings bank with total assets in excess of $16 billion (consolidated) that conducted consumer and business banking activities through a network of approximately 150 bank branches located in Texas and California that provided commercial banking products and services to various geographic markets throughout the United States.  Guaranty Insurance Services, Inc. became an insurance agency that focused on property and casualty insurance with fixed annuities and operated out of 17 offices located in Texas and California, as well as through branches of Guaranty Bank.[9] Also in November 
In November 2008, Kenneth R. Dubuque resigned as president and chief executive officer of the company and the bank, positions he had served in beginning in 1998 and continuing through November 18, 2008. John T. Stuart III, a director of the company and the bank, was appointed as interim chief executive officer and interim chairman of the board of the company.[10] Also in November 2008, the company appointed Kevin J. Hanigan, previously a senior executive vice president and chief banking officer of the company and the bank, to fill the role of president and chief operating officer of the company and the bank.[10]

Collapse[edit]
As a thrift bank, its charter required it to keep 70% of its assets in housing-related investments, leaving it exposed to the 2008 US housing crash[3]
In April 2009, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the bank to take a $1.5 billion writedown on the value of the mortgage-backed securities it held. This in turn left the bank with an inadequate Tier 1 capital ratio, with the bank issuing a statement saying that it was likely to be too undercapitalized to continue as a going concern.[11] The bank's share price collapsed from $18.50 to less than 15 cents.[5]
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assumed control of the failed bank August 21, 2009.[2] This was the 10th largest bank failure in US history, and the second largest of the 140 bank collapses of 2009 (behind Colonial Bank).[12]
The FDIC immediately sold the assets of the bank to BBVA Compass, the US-based subsidiary of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), the second biggest bank in Spain.[2] This was the first deal between the FDIC and an institution bank tied to a foreign bank for almost 20 years.[13] Under the agreement, the FDIC and BBVA Compass shared the losses of the bank, with the costs to the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund estimated to be $3 billion.[2][12] Guaranty Bank was absorbed into its new parent company, with its branches being rebranded as BBVA Compass outlets.[14]

Primary hyperparathyroidism (or PHPT) is a medical condition where the parathyroid gland (or a benign tumor within it) produce excess amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The symptoms of the condition relate to the resulting elevated serum calcium (hypercalcemia), which can cause digestive symptoms, kidney stones, psychiatric abnormalities, and bone disease.
The diagnosis is initially made on blood tests; an elevated level of calcium together with a raised (or inappropriately high) level of parathyroid hormone are typically found. To identify the source of the excessive hormone secretion, medical imaging may be performed. Parathyroidectomy, the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands, may be required to control symptoms.


Signs and symptoms[edit]
The signs and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism are those of hypercalcemia.  They are classically summarized by "stones, bones, abdominal groans, thrones and psychiatric overtones".[1]

"Stones" refers to kidney stones, nephrocalcinosis, and diabetes insipidus (polyuria and polydipsia). These can ultimately lead to kidney failure.
"Bones" refers to bone-related complications. The classic bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which results in pain and sometimes pathological fractures.  Other bone diseases associated with hyperparathyroidism are osteoporosis, osteomalacia, and arthritis.
"Abdominal groans" refers to gastrointestinal symptoms of constipation, indigestion, nausea and vomiting.  Hypercalcemia can lead to peptic ulcers and acute pancreatitis. The peptic ulcers can be an effect of increased gastric acid secretion by hypercalcemia.[2]
"Thrones" refers to polyuria and constipation
"Psychiatric overtones" refers to effects on the central nervous system.  Symptoms include lethargy, fatigue, depression, memory loss, psychosis, ataxia, delirium, and coma.
Left ventricular hypertrophy may also be seen.[3]
Other signs include proximal muscle weakness, itching, and band keratopathy of the eyes.[citation needed]
When subjected to formal research, symptoms of depression, pain, and gastric dysfunction seem to correlate with mild cases of hypercalcemia.[4]

Causes[edit]
The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a sporadic, single parathyroid adenoma[5] resulting from a clonal mutation (~97%).  Less common are parathyroid hyperplasia[6] (~2.5%), parathyroid carcinoma (malignant tumor), and adenomas in more than one gland (together ~0.5%).Primary hyperparathyroidism is also a feature of several familial endocrine disorders:  Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 and type 2A (MEN type 1 and MEN type 2A), and familial hyperparathyroidism.[citation needed]
Genetic associations include:

In all cases, the disease is idiopathic, but is thought to involve inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (Menin gene in MEN1), or involve gain of function mutations (RET proto-oncogene MEN 2a).[citation needed]
Recently, it was demonstrated that liquidators of the Chernobyl power plant are faced with a substantial risk of primary hyperparathyroidism, possibly caused by radioactive strontium isotopes.[8]

Diagnosis[edit]
The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is made by blood tests.[citation needed]
Serum calcium levels are usually elevated, and the parathyroid hormone level is abnormally high compared with an expected low level in response to the high calcium. A relatively elevated parathyroid hormone has been estimated to have a sensitivity of 60–80% and a specificity of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism.[9]
A more powerful variant of comparing the balance between calcium and parathyroid hormone is to perform a 3-hour calcium infusion. After infusion, a parathyroid hormone level above a cutoff of 14 ng/L has a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93% in detecting primary hyperparathyroidism, with a confidence interval of 80% to 100%.[10]
Urinary cAMP is occasionally measured; it is generally elevated due to activation of Gs proteins when PTH binds to its receptor.[11]
Biochemical confirmation of primary hyperparathyroidism is following by investigations to localize the culprit lesion. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly due to solitary parathyroid adenoma. Less commonly it may be due to double parathyroid adenomas or parathyroid hyperplasia. Tc99 sestamibi scan of head, neck and upper thorax is the most commonly used test for localizing parathyroid adenomas having a sensitivity and specificity of 70–80%. Sensitivity falls down to 30% in case of double/multiple parathyroid adenomas or in case of parathyroid hyperplasia. Ultrasonography is also a useful test in localizing suspicious parathyroid lesions.[citation needed]

Normocalcemic Primary Hyperparathyroidism[edit]
Normocalcemic PHPT was first recognized in 2009 by an international panel of experts.[12] By definition these patients have normal serum calcium (though usually in the upper range) and are typically found to have elevated PTH during workup for osteoporosis. In order to diagnose normocalcemic PHPT, ionized calcium levels should be normal, and all secondary causes for secondary hyperparathyroidism (such as vitamin D deficiency and chronic kidney disease) ruled out.

Treatment[edit]
Treatment is usually surgical removal of the gland(s) containing adenomas, but medication may also be required.[citation needed]

Surgery[edit]
The surgical removal of one or more of the parathyroid glands is known as a parathyroidectomy; this operation was first performed in 1925.[13] The symptoms of the disease, listed above, are indications for surgery. Surgery reduces all cause mortality as well as resolving symptoms. However, cardiovascular mortality is not significantly reduced.[14]
The 2002 NIH Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism developed criteria for surgical intervention . The criteria were revised at the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism . These criteria were chosen on the basis of clinical experience and observational and clinical trial data as to which patients are more likely to have end-organ effects of primary hyperparathyroidism (nephrolithiasis, skeletal involvement), disease progression if surgery is deferred, and the most benefit from surgery. The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. The Third International Workshop guidelines concluded that surgery is indicated in asymptomatic patients who meet any one of the following conditions:[citation needed]

Serum calcium concentration of 1.0 mg/dL (0.25 mmol/L) or more above the upper limit of normal
Creatinine clearance that is reduced to <60 mL/min
Bone density at the hip, lumbar spine, or distal radius that is more than 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (T score <-2.5) and/or previous fragility fracture
Age less than 50 years
Operative intervention can be delayed in patients over 50 years of age who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and who have serum calcium concentrations <1.0 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L) above the upper limit of normal, and in patients who are medically unfit for surgery[citation needed]
More recently, three randomized controlled trials have studied the role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. The largest study reported that surgery resulted in an increase in bone mass, but no improvement in quality of life after one to two years among patients in the following groups:[15]

Untreated, asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism
Serum calcium between 2.60 and 2.85 mmol/liter (10.4–11.4 mg/dL)
Age between 50 and 80 yr
No medications interfering with Ca metabolism
No hyperparathyroid bone disease
No previous operation in the neck
Creatinine level < 130 μmol/liter (<1.47 mg/dL)
Two other trials reported improvements in bone density and some improvement in quality of life with surgery.[16][17]

Medications[edit]
Medications are used when surgery is not indicated or for poor surgical candidates.[18] Calcimimetics are used to reduce the amount of parathyroid hormone released by the parathyroid glands and subsequent hypercalcemia. Other medications used for PHPT includes treatments for osteoporosis such as estrogen replacement therapy, bisphosphonates or denosumab and for treatment hypercalciuria to reduce the risk for kidney stones.[19]

Epidemiology[edit]
Primary hyperparathyroidism affects approximately 1 per 1,000 people (0.1%),[20] while there are 25–30 new cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States.[21] The prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism has been estimated to be 3 in 1000 in the general population and as high as 21 in 1000 in postmenopausal women.[22] It is almost exactly three times as common in women as men.[citation needed]
Primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with increased all-cause mortality.[14]

Children[edit]
In contrast with primary hyperparathyroidism in adults, primary hyperparathyroidism in children is considered a rare endocrinopathy. Pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism can be distinguished by its more severe manifestations, in contrast to the less intense manifestations in adult primary hyperparathyroidism. Multiple endocrine neoplasia is more likely to be associated with childhood and adolescent primary hyperparathyroidism. The fundamental  skeletal radiologic manifestation include diffuse osteopenia, pathologic fractures and the coexistence of resorption and sclerosis at numerous sites. Skeletal lesions can be specifically bilateral, symmetric and multifocal, exhibiting different types of bone resorption. Pathologic fractures of the femoral neck and spine can potentially initiate serious complications. Because pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is frequently associated with pathologic fractures it can be misdiagnosed as osteogenesis imperfecta. Pediatric patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are best remedied by parathyroidectomy. Early diagnosis of pediatric primary hyperparathyroidism is all-important to minimize disease complications and start off timely and relevant treatment.[23][24]

Research directions[edit]
Future developments such as calcimimetic agents (e.g. cinacalcet) which activate the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor may offer a good alternative to surgery.[citation needed]

Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. The term originally meant 'carefree', 'cheerful', or 'bright and showy'.[1]
While scant usage referring to male homosexuality dates to the late 19th century, that meaning became increasingly common by the mid-20th century.[2] In modern English, gay has come to be used as an adjective, and as a noun, referring to the community, practices and cultures associated with homosexuality. In the 1960s, gay became the word favored by homosexual men to describe their sexual orientation.[3] By the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, the word gay was recommended by major LGBT groups and style guides to describe people attracted to members of the same sex,[4][5] although it is more commonly used to refer specifically to men.[6]
At about the same time, a new, pejorative use became prevalent in some parts of the world. Among younger speakers, the word has a meaning ranging from derision (e.g., equivalent to 'rubbish' or 'stupid') to a light-hearted mockery or ridicule (e.g., equivalent to 'weak', 'unmanly', or 'lame'). The extent to which these usages still retain connotations of homosexuality has been debated and harshly criticized.[7][8][needs update]


History
Overview
Cartoon from Punch magazine in 1857 illustrating the use of "gay" as a colloquial euphemism for being a prostitute.[9] One woman says to the other (who looks glum), "How long have you been gay?" The poster on the wall is for La Traviata, an opera about a courtesan.
The word gay arrived in English during the 12th century from Old French gai, most likely deriving ultimately from a Germanic source.[2]
In English, the word's primary meaning was "joyful", "carefree", "bright and showy", and the word was very commonly used with this meaning in speech and literature. For example, the optimistic 1890s are still often referred to as the Gay Nineties. The title of the 1938 French ballet Gaîté Parisienne ("Parisian Gaiety"), which became the 1941 Warner Brothers movie, The Gay Parisian,[10] also illustrates this connotation. It was apparently not until the 20th century that the word began to be used to mean specifically "homosexual", although it had earlier acquired sexual connotations.[2]
The derived abstract noun gaiety remains largely free of sexual connotations and has, in the past, been used in the names of places of entertainment, such as the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin.

Sexualization
Usage statistics from English books, according to Google Ngram Viewer.
The word may have started to acquire associations of sexual immorality as early as the 14th century, but had certainly acquired them by the 17th.[2] By the late 17th century, it had acquired the specific meaning of "addicted to pleasures and dissipations",[11] an extension of its primary meaning of "carefree" implying "uninhibited by moral constraints". A gay woman was a prostitute, a gay man a womanizer, and a gay house a brothel.[12][2] An example is a letter read to a London court in 1885 during the prosecution of brothel madam and procuress Mary Jeffries that had been written by a girl while enslaved inside of a French brothel:

"I write to tell you it is a gay house...Some captains came in the other night, and the mistress wanted us to sleep with them."[13]
The use of gay to mean "homosexual" was often an extension of its application to prostitution: a gay boy was a young man or boy serving male clients.[14]
Similarly, a gay cat was a young male apprenticed to an older hobo and commonly exchanging sex and other services for protection and tutelage.[2] The application to homosexuality was also an extension of the word's sexualized connotation of "carefree and uninhibited", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual mores. Such usage, documented as early as the 1920s, was likely present before the 20th century,[2] although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as in the once-common phrase "gay Lothario",[15] or in the title of the book and film The Gay Falcon (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is "Gay". Similarly, Fred Gilbert and G. H. MacDermott's music hall song of the 1880s, "Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk" – "Master Dilke upset the milk, when taking it home to Chelsea; the papers say that Charlie's gay, rather a wilful wag!" – referred to Sir Charles Dilke's alleged heterosexual impropriety.[16] Giving testimony in court in 1889, the prostitute John Saul stated: "I occasionally do odd-jobs for different gay people."[17]
Well into the mid 20th century a middle-aged bachelor could be described as "gay", indicating that he was unattached and therefore free, without any implication of homosexuality. This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip Jane, first published in the 1930s, described the adventures of Jane Gay. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on Lady Jane Grey).
A passage from Gertrude Stein's Miss Furr & Miss Skeene (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family, 1995) the portrait "featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history", and Edmund Wilson (1951, quoted by James Mellow in Charmed Circle, 1974) agreed.[18] For example:

They were ... gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay, ... they were quite regularly gay.— Gertrude Stein, 1922
The word continued to be used with the dominant meaning of "carefree", as evidenced by the title of The Gay Divorcee (1934), a musical film about a heterosexual couple.
Bringing Up Baby (1938) was the first film to use the word gay in an apparent reference to homosexuality. In a scene in which Cary Grant's character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman's feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, "Because I just went gay all of a sudden!" Since this was a mainstream film at a time, when the use of the word to refer to cross-dressing (and, by extension, homosexuality) would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean, "I just decided to do something frivolous."[19]
In 1950, the earliest reference found to date for the word gay as a self-described name for homosexuals came from Alfred A. Gross, executive secretary for the George W. Henry Foundation, who said in the June 1950 issue of SIR magazine: "I have yet to meet a happy homosexual. They have a way of describing themselves as gay but the term is a misnomer. Those who are habitues of the bars frequented by others of the kind, are about the saddest people I've ever seen."[20]

Shift to specifically homosexual
By the mid-20th century, gay was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles[11] and its antonym straight, which had long had connotations of seriousness, respectability, and conventionality, had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality.[21] In the case of gay, other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress ("gay apparel") led to association with camp and effeminacy. This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning, which was at first confined to subcultures. Gay was the preferred term since other terms, such as queer, were felt to be derogatory.[22] Homosexual is perceived as excessively clinical,[23][24][25] since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as "homosexuality" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).
In mid-20th century Britain, where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967, to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity. Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include "sporty" girls and "artistic" boys,[26] all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.
The 1960s marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of "carefree" to the current "homosexual". In the British comedy-drama film Light Up the Sky! (1960), directed by Lewis Gilbert, about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by Benny Hill proposes an after-dinner toast. He begins, "I'd like to propose..." at which point a fellow diner interjects "Who to?", implying a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, "Not to you for start, you ain't my type". He then adds in mock doubt, "Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet."
By 1963, a new sense of the word gay was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting. Similarly, Hubert Selby Jr. in his 1964 novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, could write that a character "took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay...."[27] Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960–1966 animated TV series The Flintstones, wherein viewers are assured that they will "have a gay old time." Similarly, the 1966 Herman's Hermits song "No Milk Today", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a Top 40 hit in the U.S., included the lyric "No milk today, it was not always so; The company was gay, we'd turn night into day."[28]
In June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album in the British daily newspaper The Times stated, "The Beatles revive hopes of progress in pop music with their gay new LP".[29] The same year, The Kinks recorded "David Watts", which is about a schoolmate of Ray Davies, but is named after a homosexual concert promoter they knew, with the ambiguous line "he is so gay and fancy-free" attesting to the word's double meaning at that time.[30] As late as 1970, the first episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show has the demonstrably straight Mary Richards' neighbor Phyllis breezily declaiming that Mary is still "young and gay", but in an episode about two years later, Phyllis is told that her brother is "gay", which is immediately understood to mean that he is homosexual.

See also: Situational sexual behavior
The American Psychological Association defines sexual orientation as "an enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes," ranging "along a continuum, from exclusive attraction to the other sex to exclusive attraction to the same sex."[31] Sexual orientation can also be "discussed in terms of three categories: heterosexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of the other sex), gay/lesbian (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to members of one's own sex), and bisexual (having emotional, romantic, or sexual attractions to both men and women)."[31]
According to Rosario, Schrimshaw, Hunter, Braun (2006), "the development of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) sexual identity is a complex and often difficult process. Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised in a community of similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality."[32]
The British gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has argued that the term gay is merely a cultural expression which reflects the current status of homosexuality within a given society, and claiming that "Queer, gay, homosexual ... in the long view, they are all just temporary identities. One day, we will not need them at all."[33]
If a person engages in sexual activity with a partner of the same sex but does not self-identify as gay, terms such as 'closeted', 'discreet', or 'bi-curious' may apply. Conversely, a person may identify as gay without having had sex with a same-sex partner. Possible choices include identifying as gay socially, while choosing to be celibate, or while anticipating a first homosexual experience. Further, a bisexual person might also identify as "gay" but others may consider gay and bisexual to be mutually exclusive. There are some who are drawn to the same sex but neither engage in sexual activity nor identify as gay; these could have the term asexual applied, even though asexual generally can mean no attraction, or involve heterosexual attraction but no sexual activity.

Terminology
Main article: Terminology of homosexuality
Some reject the term homosexual as an identity-label because they find it too clinical-sounding;[24][25][34] they believe it is too focused on physical acts rather than romance or attraction, or too reminiscent of the era when homosexuality was considered a mental illness. Conversely, some reject the term gay as an identity-label because they perceive the cultural connotations to be undesirable or because of the negative connotations of the slang usage of the word.
Style guides, like the following from the Associated Press, call for gay over homosexual:

Gay: Used to describe men and women attracted to the same sex, though lesbian is the more common term for women. Preferred over homosexual except in clinical contexts or references to sexual activity.[6]
There are those who reject the gay label for reasons other than shame or negative connotations. Writer Alan Bennett[35] and fashion icon André Leon Talley[36] are out and open queer men who reject being labeled gay, believing the gay label confines them.

Gay community vs. LGBT community
Main article: LGBT community
Starting in the mid-1980s in the United States, a conscious effort was underway within what was then commonly called the gay community, to add the term lesbian to the name of organizations that involved both male and female homosexuals, and to use the terminology of gay and lesbian, lesbian/gay, or a similar phrase when referring to that community. Accordingly, organizations such as the National Gay Task Force became the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. For many feminist lesbians, it was also important that lesbian be named first, to avoid the implication that women were secondary to men, or an afterthought.[37] In the 1990s, this was followed by a similar effort to include terminology specifically including bisexual, transgender, intersex, and other people, reflecting the intra-community debate about the inclusion of these other sexual minorities as part of the same movement. Consequently, the portmanteau les/bi/gay has sometimes been used, and initialisms such as LGBT, LGBTQ, LGBTQI, and others have come into common use by such organizations, and most news organizations have formally adopted some such variation.

Descriptor
"Bar Revenge", a Gay Bar in Brighton, England
The term gay can also be used as an adjective to describe things related to homosexual men, or things which are part of the said culture. For example, the term "gay bar" describes the bar which either caters primarily to a homosexual male clientele or is otherwise part of homosexual male culture.
Using it to describe an object, such as an item of clothing, suggests that it is particularly flamboyant, often on the verge of being gaudy and garish. This usage predates the association of the term with homosexuality but has acquired different connotations since the modern usage developed.


Use as a noun
The label gay was originally used purely as an adjective ("he is a gay man" or "he is gay"). The term has also been in use as a noun with the meaning "homosexual man" since the 1970s, most commonly in the plural for an unspecified group, as in "gays are opposed to that policy." This usage is somewhat common in the names of organizations such as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and Children of Lesbians And Gays Everywhere (COLAGE). It is sometimes used to refer to individuals, as in "he is a gay" or "two gays were there too," although this may be perceived as derogatory.[38] It was also used for comedic effect by the Little Britain character Dafydd Thomas.

Generalized pejorative use
When used with a derisive attitude (e.g., "that was so gay"), the word gay is pejorative. Though retaining other meanings, its use among young people as a term of disparagement is common; 97 percent of American LGBTQ middle and high school students reported hearing its negative use as of 2021.[7][39][40]
This pejorative usage has its origins in the late 1970s, with the word gaining a pejorative sense by association with the previous meaning: homosexuality was seen as inferior or undesirable.[41] Beginning in the 1980s, and especially in the late 1990s, the usage as a generic insult became common among young people.[7] Use of "gay" in some circumstances continues to be considered a pejorative in present day. As recently as 2023, the American Psychological Association described language like "that's so gay" as heterosexist and heteronormative.[42]
The pejorative usage of the word "gay" has been criticized as homophobic. A 2006 BBC ruling by the Board of Governors over the negative use of the word by Chris Moyles advises that "caution on its use"; however, it acknowledges its common use among young people to mean "rubbish" or "lame".[39]
The BBC's ruling was heavily criticized by the Minister for Children, Kevin Brennan, who stated in response that "the casual use of homophobic language by mainstream radio DJs" is:

"too often seen as harmless banter instead of the offensive insult that it really represents. ... To ignore this problem is to collude in it. The blind eye to casual name-calling, looking the other way because it is the easy option, is simply intolerable."[43]
Shortly after the Moyles incident, a campaign against homophobia was launched in Britain under the slogan "homophobia is gay", playing on the double meaning of the word "gay" in youth culture, as well as the popular perception that vocal homophobia is common among closeted homosexuals.[44]
The United States had its own popular campaign against the pejorative use of "gay" called Think B4 You Speak. It was created in 2008 in partnership with the Advertising Council, GLSEN, and Arnold NYC. This initiative created television, radio, print and web PSAs with goals "to motivate teens to become allies in the efforts to raise awareness, stop using anti-LGBT language and safely intervene when they are present and anti-LGBT harassment and behavior occurs."[45]
Research has looked into the use and effect of the pejorative. In a 2013 article published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence, University of Michigan researchers Michael Woodford, Alex Kulick and Perry Silverschanz, alongside Appalachian State University professor Michael L. Howell, argued that the pejorative use of the word "gay" was a microaggression.[46] They found that college-age men were more likely to repeat the word pejoratively if their friends said it, while they were less likely to say it if they had lesbian, gay or bisexual peers.[46] A 2019 study used data collected in a 2013 survey of cisgender LGBQ college students to evaluate the effects of microaggressions like "that's so gay" and "no homo."[47] It found that increased exposure to the phrase "that's so gay" was significantly associated with greater developmental challenge (a measure of academic stressors).[47] Research published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 2021 finds that use of anti-gay banter among Midwestern middle and high school students such as "that's so gay" is perceived less negatively and more humorously if the person saying it is a friend.[48]

Parallels in other languages and cultures
The concept of a "gay identity" and the use of the term gay may not be used or understood the same way in non-Westernised cultures, since modes of sexuality may differ from those prevalent in the West.[49]
For example, two-spirit is a term used by some Indigenous people in the United States and Canada to describe Indigenous people in their communities who do not conform to Western expressions of gender and sexuality. It functions as a modern, pan-Indian umbrella term, much like the use of queer or LGBTQ by non-Natives. Some Indigenous people identify as both two-spirit and gay.[50][51] For some traditional Native Americans, who usually use terms in their own languages for these individuals rather than the English neologism, two-spirit is not interchangeable with the "LGBT Native American" or "gay Indian"[52] sexual and gender identity labels because it is a sacred, spiritual, and ceremonial role that is recognized and confirmed only by tribal elders of the two-spirit person's ceremonial community.[50]
The German equivalent for "gay", "schwul", which is etymologically derived from "schwül" (hot, humid), also acquired the pejorative meaning within youth culture.[53]

Longusunguis is an extinct genus of bohaiornithid enantiornithean dinosaur known from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning Province, northeastern China. It contains a single species, Longusunguis kurochkini.[1]


Discovery[edit]
Longusunguis was first described and named by Min Wang, Zhong-He Zhou, Jingmai K. O'Connor and Nikita V. Zelenkov in 2014 and the type species is Longusunguis kurochkini. The generic name is derived from the Latin words longus, meaning "long", and unguis, meaning "claw", in reference to the distinctly elongated pedal unguals that this taxon shares with other bohaiornithids. The specific name, kurochkini, honors the late Prof. Evgeny Kurochkin, a prominent paleontologist, for his contributions to the study of fossil birds.[1]
Longusunguis is known solely from the holotype IVPP V 17964, a complete and articulated skeleton and skull. It is preserved in a single slab and currently housed at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Beijing. IVPP V 17964 was collected at deposits near the Lamadong Town, Jianchang County of the Liaoning Province, from the Jiufotang Formation, dated to the Aptian stage of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 120.3 million years ago.[1]

Description[edit]
Longusunguis differs from all other known bohaiornithid enantiornitheans by possessing a combination of traits, some of which are autapomorphies, i.e. unique. The maxilla of Longusunguis possesses an accessory fenestra on the jugal process. This trait is unique among bohaiornithids, as only Zhouornis possesses such fenestra, however on the dorsal process. Its lacrimal bone shows an elongate excavation on the caudal margin of its descending ramus. In Longusunguis, the lateral margin of the coracoid is more convex than in other bohaiornithids. In Longusunguis, the acromion process is strongly projecting dorsally (more than in Sulcavis), whereas in Parabohaiornis this process is straight, and is parallel to the scapular shaft. Finally, its pygostyle is longer than the tarsometatarsus. The holotype of Longusunguis came from a subadult individual, as evident by the absence of fusion in some compound bones, such as the carpometacarpus, tibiotarsus and tarsometatarsus.[1]

Phylogeny[edit]
The phylogenetic position of Longusunguis was explored by Wang et al. (2014) using a data matrix that includes 56 avialan taxa, scored based on 262 morphological traits. Longusunguis was recovered as an advanced bohaiornithid, closely related to Bohaiornis and Parabohaiornis whose specimens were collected at nearby localities, also near the Lamadong Town. The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of Longusunguis among the Enantiornithes following this analysis.[1]

Karol Chmiel (1911–1951) was born on 17 April 1911 in the village of Zagorzyce (now in Ropczyce-Sędziszów County, Subcarpathian Voivodeship) to the peasant family of Antoni and Katarzyna née Charchut. He graduated from high school in Dębica, and was admitted to the prestigious Jagiellonian University in Kraków, where he studied law. After graduation, in 1935, Chmiel settled in Wojslaw, a village near Mielec; his wife Irena Suchodolska was a school principal, and he worked for the Town Hall in Mielec.

World War II[edit]
At the beginning of the Polish September Campaign, Chmiel tried to escape east, to the area of Lwów, where his wife's family owned an estate. Unable to do so, they returned to the village of Zagorzyce, with their three-year-old son, Jerzy. On 6 January 1940 Chmiel's wife died, after delivering their second son, Zbigniew. After this, the boys were looked after by Irena's mother and her sisters.
As early as January 1940, Chmiel became a member of Zwiazek Walki Zbrojnej, with the nom de guerre "Los". From January 1941, he was commandant of a platoon in Zagorzyce, which was part of Dębica's District of ZWZ (later: Polish Home Army). Promoted to colonel, in 1943 he decided to move to Bataliony Chłopskie (BCh), becoming in early 1944 the commandant of BCh's Dębica District. He participated in Operation Tempest activities in the area of Dębica, being a member of the local headquarters of the anti-German resistance.
Some time in 1944, Chmiel drove a captured German car, but he forgot to display a Polish flag on it, and was peppered with bullets by  Home Army soldiers. Shot 13 times, he was severely wounded, but managed to survive. Nevertheless, he became partly disabled.

After the war[edit]
After 1945, Chmiel settled in Kraków, where he opened a grocery store and bought a house in Swoszowice, a village in the suburbs. He was an active member of the Polish People's Party (PSL), and secretly a member of the anti-Communist organization, Wolnosc i Niezawislosc (WiN). In 1947, he became a member of WiN's headquarters and political adviser to Łukasz Ciepliński as well as a liaison between Cieplinski and the PSL's Stanislaw Mikolajczyk.
At the request of Cieplinski, Chmiel, together with Stefan Rostworowski, created a "Memorial to the United Nations". This document publicised crimes committed by the Soviet and Polish secret services on members of the disbanded Home Army and anti-Communist activists. Reportedly, WiN was planning to move Chmiel to the West, but these plans were nipped in the bud.

Arrest and incarceration[edit]
Karol Chmiel was arrested by Urząd Bezpieczeństwa agents on 12 December 1947. Together with other members of WiN, he was moved to the infamous Mokotów Prison in Warsaw. For three years, he was tortured, and his family did not know about his whereabouts, as contact with the outside world was strictly prohibited.

Trial[edit]
His show trial began on 5 October 1950 and lasted for five days. Chmiel's family was allowed to enter the courtroom, so he had a chance to see his sons and hand them letters. One of these letters is now displayed in a museum in Jasna Góra.
On 14 October 1950, by the order of the Warsaw Area Court, Chmiel was sentenced to death twice. President Bolesław Bierut refused to pardon him and his co-defendants (see: 1951 Mokotów Prison execution).

Execution[edit]
All sentenced persons spent their final night in separate cells. On 1 March 1951 all their private belongings were taken away, their hands were tied and mouths taped. Then they were taken to an old boiler room and shot in the back of the head, while walking down the stairs. Chmiel was executed at 8:15 pm and his body was buried in unknown location.
On 17 September 1992 Karol Chmiel was retrospectively cleared of all charges by the Warsaw Military Court.

United Nations Security Council Resolution 1915, adopted unanimously on March 18, 2010, after recalling resolutions 827 (1993), 1581 (2005), 1597 (2005), 1613 (2005), 1629 (2005), 1660 (2006), 1668 (2006), 1800 (2008), 1837 (2008), 1849 (2008), 1877 (2009) and 1900 (2009), the Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, allowed a temporary increase in judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to serve beyond the expiry of their term of office to enable them to complete work on cases in which they were involved.[1]
The Council noted that, in its Resolution 1900, the number of judges could exceed the maximum of 12 provided for in the Statute of the International Tribunal to a maximum of 13, returning to 12 by the end of March 2010. However, due to unforeseen circumstances this would not occur due to a delay in the delivery of the judgement in the Popović case. In this regard, the Council was convinced of the advisability of permitting the temporary increase in the total number of ad litem judges.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, established in Resolution 827 (1993), was a United Nations court of law dealing with war crimes that took place during the conflicts of the early 1990s that followed the break-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The Elan Valley Reservoirs (Welsh: Cronfeydd Cwm Elan) are a chain of man-made lakes created from damming the Elan and Claerwen rivers within the Elan Valley in Mid Wales. The reservoirs, which were built by the Birmingham Corporation Water Department, provide clean drinking water for Birmingham in the West Midlands of England. The five lakes are known as the Claerwen, Craig-goch, Pen-y-garreg, Garreg-ddu, and Caban-coch.[2]
Water from the reservoirs is carried by gravity to Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham via the Elan aqueduct. Pumping is not required because the network drops 52 metres (171 ft) along its 73-mile (117 km) length from its source to Frankley. A gradient of 1:2,300 maintains a flow of less than 2 miles per hour (3.2 km/h); water takes one and a half to two days to reach Birmingham.[3] The aqueduct, which was started in 1896 and opened in 1906, crosses several valleys and features numerous brick tunnels, pipelines, and valve houses.[4]
Work to build the Elan Valley reservoirs was undertaken because the rapid growth of the industrial city of Birmingham in the late 19th century had led to a lack of available clean water. Numerous outbreaks of disease prompted Birmingham City Council to petition the British government which passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act in 1892.[5] It allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase all the land within the water catchment area of the Elan Valleys. Thousands of navvies (workers) and their families lived in the purpose-built Elan Village during the construction of the first four dams at the turn of the 20th century. In 1952, the Claerwen dam was opened by Elizabeth II in one of her first official engagements as monarch.
Drinking water from the Elan Valley is noted for being exceptionally soft, contrasting with water from local supplies in the West Midlands, not served by the Elan aqueduct, which are noted for hardness.[6]
The reservoirs are now owned and managed by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. The water filtration works further down the valley is run by Severn Trent Water.


Description[edit]
Garreg-ddu dam seen at low water, summer 2003. Its job is to maintain a constant level in the reservoir during drought conditions so water can still enter the Elan Valley aqueduct.
There are four main dams and reservoirs (constructed 1893–1904 in Elan Valley, and 1946–1952 at Claerwen) with a potential total capacity of nearly 100,000 megalitres. The dams and reservoirs are:[7]

Caban-coch – 35,530 megalitre capacity
Pen-y-garreg – 6,055 megalitre capacity
Craig-goch – 9,220 megalitre capacity
Claerwen – 48,694 megalitre capacity
In addition to the four main dams, there are three other dams at the site:

The Dol-y-mynach dam – it was to be one of a series of three dams that would be built to contain the waters of Afon Claerwen. They were to be constructed in accordance with the growth of Birmingham. However, the project was never completed even though the masonry foundations of the first dam were laid at the same time the Elan Valley dams were being constructed. The work had to be done in advance because the water level of the Caban Coch would have submerged the site once the reservoir was full. The three-dam project became redundant when newer materials and superior engineering allowed the construction of the single larger Claerwen dam higher up the valley in the 1940/50s.
The Nant-y-Gro dam – this small dam was constructed in the early stages of the project to supply water to the navvies' village at the site; it was used during the Second World War by Sir Barnes Wallis during trials of the explosive charges he intended to use in the bouncing bombs which later targeted the Ruhr dams in Germany.
The Garreg-ddu dam – although looking like a viaduct, it is actually a submerged dam. Its role is to maintain a sufficient level in the Garreg-ddu reservoir so water can enter the Foel Tower and the gravity-driven aqueduct to the Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham. The dam is only required to operate during times of extreme drought.

Construction[edit]
Men and women in buses and cars visiting a reservoir in Elan Valley c. 1910.
The Elan dam scheme was developed in the 19th century following rapid growth of the population of Birmingham due to the Industrial Revolution. The city's expansion resulted in regular outbreaks of water-borne diseases and major epidemics such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery due to the lack of clean water.
Victorian politician Joseph Chamberlain, the leader of Birmingham City Council, began a campaign to get clean water from the Elan and Claerwen valleys in mid Wales. The area, which had been identified by civil engineer James Mansergh, would be ideal for water reservoirs because:

it had an average annual rainfall of 1,830 millimetres (72 in).
dams could be easily built in the narrow valleys.
the bedrock was impermeable to water.
there was no need for pumping stations because the reservoirs in Wales would be 52 metres (171 ft) above the water cisterns in Birmingham.
In 1892, Parliament passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act[5] allowing the Corporation to effect compulsory purchase of the total water catchment area of the Elan and Claerwen valleys (approximately 180 square kilometres (69 sq mi). The Act also gave Birmingham Corporation powers to move more than 100 people living in the Elan Valley. All the buildings were demolished; these included three manor houses (two of which had links with the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1812),[8] 18 farms, a school and a church (which was replaced with Nantgwyllt Church). Only landowners were given compensation.
Work began to construct the reservoirs the following year in 1893. Construction was overseen by James Mansergh, on behalf of the City of Birmingham's Water Department. Due to the height above sea level of the Elan Valley, water would be fed to Birmingham along a 116-kilometre (72 mi) pipeline that employed a gravity feed with a gradient of 1 in 2,300.[9] The schedule for the project was to build the four lower Elan Valley dams first. The Claerwen would then be built later (work was expected to begin in 1939 but was delayed by the Second World War; it was completed in 1952).[10]

Mineral railway[edit]
The Elan Valley Railway, which was a standard-gauge line, was built by Birmingham Corporation especially for the project. It ran through the Elan Valley from a junction near Rhayader on the Mid-Wales Railway. The first section to be built was a 4-kilometre (2.5 mi) branch from the main line at Rhayader to the main work site at the Caban-coch dam. This depot included a cement cooling shed, general stores, coal storage, workshops for carpenters, smiths, fitters and wagon builders, and sawmills. Further branches were eventually built to all the other dam sites. Engines and trucks reached the top of the dams on wooden trestle scaffolds supported by concrete parapets. The line went as far as the site where the foundations of the Dol-y-mynach dam were being built (lower down the valley from the later Claerwen dam). At its height, the railway had a total length of 45 kilometres (28 mi) with six locomotives transporting up to 1,000 tons of materials a day. Following the completion of the lower dams, the entire Elan Valley Railway had been entirely lifted by 1916. 
Road transport was used when the Claerwen dam was built in the late 1940s and 1950s.
The railway was required because the core of the Caban-coch, Pen-y-garreg and Craig-goch dams were built from large irregular stone blocks ("plums") embedded in concrete. The rock was mined locally from Cigfran and Craig-cnwch quarries by the Elan River and the Aberdeuddwr quarry on Cerrig Gwynion, just to the south of Rhayader. The shaped stones were hauled by locomotive to the dam sites on flatbed trucks. They were then lowered into place by steam crane. The central cores of the dams were encased with a 2-metre (6 ft 7 in) concrete lining. The outside walls were faced with cut stone brought from quarries at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells and Pontypridd. The cement, which was made near Chatham in Kent, was sent by sea to Aberystwyth and brought by railway to the Elan Valley.
The cost of the Elan valley scheme ran over budget because of the failure to find suitable building stone near any of the dams apart from Caban-coch, as well as the necessity of bringing in facing stone from other quarries in mid and south Wales.

Workers' village[edit]
During the ten-year project to build the Elan Valley dams, the navvies lived in a village of wooden huts near the site. This settlement, which was strictly controlled to keep order and health, would eventually become Elan Village (see Elan Valley). Guards controlled access in and out; this was done to reduce illness and to stop liquor smuggling. All new workers were deloused and examined for infectious diseases before being admitted. To keep order, a man and his wife shared a terrace house with eight single men. A school was provided for under-11-year-olds, who were expected to work on attaining that age. The camp also had a hospital for injuries, an isolation hospital for infectious cases, and a bath house. Men were allowed to drink beer at a pub, though women were not. Other facilities included a library, public hall, shop and canteen.

Hydro-electricity[edit]
Electric street lighting in the construction village was powered by hydroelectric generators. A century later, small-scale hydro-generation was again introduced as a by-product of some of the Elan Valley reservoirs. As of 2013[update], a renewable-energy firm, Infinis, is operating five water turbines in the district with a combined capacity of about 4 MW.[11][12][13]

Opening and later progress[edit]
Part of the model in Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham.
The project to supply water to Birmingham was officially opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 21 July 1904. As the first four dams provided enough drinking water to meet Birmingham's needs in the early 20th century, it was proposed not to proceed with the damming of the River Claerwen at Dol-y-mynach, Ciloerwynt and Pant-y-beddau until the 1930s.
However, that phase of construction was postponed due to the outbreak of the Second World War. It was not until 1946 that work began on damming the Claerwen. Plans to build the Dol-y-mynach, Ciloerwynt and Pant-y-beddau dams were dropped because of improvements in civil engineering and materials. Instead, work began on a single, much larger, concrete dam higher up the valley. As its designers wanted the Claerwen dam to visually match the earlier dams in the Elan Valley, Italian stonemasons were contracted to decorate the facade  in a mock Victorian ashlar. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened Claerwen Reservoir in 1952 in one of her first engagements as monarch.
A scale model of the reservoir network, in the form of ornamental ponds, is located in Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham.[14]

Dam Busters[edit]
Remains of the breached Nant-y-Gro dam as seen in 2008.
In 1942, the Nant-y-Gro dam, which had been originally built to provide water for the navvies' village, was used by Barnes Wallis to prove his theory that an underwater explosion could create sufficient hydrostatic pressure to collapse a dam wall. The test proved successful as a significant breach in the middle of the 11-metre (36 ft) dam wall was caused by a charge placed at its base.
The lessons learned at Nant-y-Gro green lit the development of the "Upkeep" bouncing bombs. They were used in the 1943 Dam Busters raid when RAF Bomber Command breached and damaged several dams in the Ruhr Valley, Germany.
The remains of the breached Nant-y-Gro dam are in much the same state as it was left in 1942, although partly obscured by trees.
After the Dam Busters raid, steel cables were strung across the valley above the Caban-coch reservoir as a precautionary measure against German reprisals.[citation needed]

Aborted expansion scheme[edit]
Caban-coch dam, summer 2009.
In the early 1970s, it was proposed that the Craig-goch reservoir should be substantially increased in size with a new and higher downstream dam together with another dam to the north-west, impounding water that would otherwise have flowed down the Ystwyth valley. This scheme would have created a huge reservoir dwarfing all others in Mid Wales, and flooding miles of wild upland valleys. The proposals were eventually abandoned in the face of reducing projections for industrial water demand and an increasing awareness of the environmental issues that such an expansion might create.

In popular culture[edit]
Elizabeth Clarke wrote The Valley (published by Faber & Faber, 1969) an account of Welsh hill farming life in the valley between the two main periods of construction. Many references are made to the dams, as well as an account of the later enquiry from the hill farmers' point of view.
Francis Brett Young researched the Elan Valley as the basis for his novel The House under the Water [Heinemann, 1932] imagining how the scene may have appeared in 1887.

The memorial to Elizabeth Coppin in St. Stephen's Norwich
Elizabeth Coppin, née Clyatt (1768–1812) was an English painter
Born in Norfolk as Elizabeth Clyatt, she was married to artist Daniel Coppin, one the founding members of the Norwich School of Painters; the couple were the parents of still life painter Emily Stannard.
In 1802 the Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce awarded her the greater Silver Pallet for a copy in pastel of a work by Salvator Rosa, and in 1808 she received a gold medal for a copy in oils of a painting by Teniers. She produced a mural at the church of St Stephen the Protomartyr in Norfolk, in which church a monument was erected to her memory by her husband; this remains the only source of biographical information about her. Coppin is known to have produced portraits. Her pastels have not survived, but an oil copy of The Cottage Door by Thomas Gainsborough is owned by the Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery.[1]

Petrus KasekePetrus KasekeBorn(1942-10-02)October 2, 1942[1]Minahasa, North Sulawesi[1]DiedAugust 2022, age 80[1]Burial placeBancaan, Salatiga[1]Occupation(s)music teacher, musical-instrument maker, carpenterYears active1954-2022Known forbuilding kolintang and angklung musical instruments, performing Indonesian traditional music worldwide
Petrus Kaseke (born in Ratahan, Minahasa, North Sulawesi, October 2, 1942) was an Indonesian conservationist of Indonesia kolintang musical instruments.[2][3]
He was labeled a "pioneer of kolintang" for Java because of his contributions to keeping the kolintang instruments from being lost.[1] As a carpenter, he was able to build instruments; as a teacher, he was able to inspire another generation to learn to play them.[1] His efforts were important, because much of the konlintang-playing community has left their ancestral land, losing contact with community culture.[3] His efforts have led to reconnection, manifesting in an October 2009 concert, in which 1223 musicians came together for a concert, witnessed by the Guinness World Records.[3]
He also made angklungs.[1]
He was honored by the Central Java Provencial Government with a certificate of appreciation for his role as an "Initiator and figure of Kolintang Music Development in the Land of Java."[1] His musical instruments are in use across the Indonesian archipelago and in other countries.[1]
As a musician, he performed internationally in Singapore in 1970, Australia in 1971, the United States in 1973, England in 1973 and Continental Europe (Netherlands in 1972, Germany in 1972 and Switzerland in 1974) and the Nordic countries (Denmark, Norway and Sweden in 1974).[4]


Manufacturing career[edit]
Kolintang and angklungMen playing kolintangsWomen with angklungs and drums. No particular connection to Kaseke's community.
In 1954, 10-year old Petrus Kaseke made his first kolintang, an instrument "with two and a half octaves diatonic notes."[5] This was an accomplishment, not only because of his age, but because of the area's history.[5]
The area had been under the control of the Dutch, who banned kolintang music as religiously offensive to their Christian sensitivities; the music was used by the native people in the worship of their ancestral spirits.[5] The pressure to make kolintang a thing of the past continued through World War II.[5]
After the war a blind musician,  Nelwan Katuuk, performed with the instrument over the radio on RRI Minahasa.[5] His circa 1952 performance gave energy to reviving the kolintang, bringing the instrument back from extinction.[5]
Petrus Kaseke continued to develop his instrument, until by 1960 he had built an instrument that encompassed three and a half octaves.[5] He won a scholarship from the Regent of Minahasa and attended the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Gadjah Mada University.[5] To supplement his scholarship while attending school, he played kolintang in Yogyakarta.[5]
After earning his bachelor's degree, he used the money he had saved while playing his kolintang to start a business.[5] At the height of his business in the 1990s, he was making as many as 10 sets of kolintangs a month and employing 20 carpenters.[5] His business survived the monetary crisis at the end of the 1990s, shrinking to production of 1-2 sets of kolintangs a month.[5] Many other kolintang manufacturers went bankrupt in this period.[5]
He also put his own touch (or a "Minahasa" touch) on the angklung, a traditional Javan musical instrument. His version, made of three tubes, arranged the three so that the middle tube had the "fundamental tone".[1] In a chord of C, the center tube was the c note, the composition of notes being 5-1-3 or g-c-e.[1] Putting the fundamental tone in the center follows the ancestral concept of Minahasa Toar, which is from the word Tuur or the main stem, the center of balance.[1]
He is also remembered for combining the kolintang and angklung instruments into one musical ensemble, taking the combination on tour.[6]

Overseas performances[edit]
In spite of the kolintang being suppressed earlier for religious reasons, the kolintang has found a home in Christian faith; the group which took the kolintang and angklung instruments overseas to Sweden did so as part of the Indonesian Pentecostal Church.[7] Kaseke may have been involved in making the group's instruments, as the article stated, "The instruments they played were made by one of the choir members."[7] The group played both kolintangs and angklungs.[7]
The performance in Australia also featured the kolintangs and angklungs.[8][9] Kaseke appeared in a photo from that tour, with two children in front of a kolintang.[9]
The group to America included members of members of the university staff of the Christian University of Salatiga, the Pentecostal Church and a bible school.[10]

1970 appeared in Singapore[1] for three days.
1971 performed in Australia[1] for roughly three months and visited more than 50 cities, including Canberra, with the Indonesian Ambassador to Australia, Sujitno Sukirno.
In 1972 he performed in several New York and Los Angeles, United States cities.[1]
In 1973 he appeared in continental Europe, including Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands (with the Indonesian Ambassador to the Netherlands.[1]
Activities in old age and the end of his life[edit]
Kaseke ran his kolintang and angklung-making business until he died.[1] His other activities included leading the Angklung Kolintang choir at the Bethany Salatiga church and teaching music at the bible school in Magelang. [1] He continued to play the kolintang and to take his grandchildren to kolintang competitions (virtually during the Covid pandemic).[1]
He had an advisory role at the Pinkan Regional Management Board (National Kolintang Human Association) Central Java, and wrote a textbook, Kolintang Maimo Kumolintang.[1]

It contains 10 tracks, including the lead single, "More", which preceded it on July 1, and the follow-up single, "Arson", which was released the same day as the album, together with an accompanying music video. A concept album revolving around the story of Pandora's box, Jack in the Box discusses themes of passion, ambition, humanity, insecurity, success, and anxiety about the future. Primarily an old-school hip hop-influenced record, the album features a blend of genres, including pop, grunge, and R&B.
Originally only available as a digital album, Jack in the Box charted in 17 territories, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, Spain, and the United Kingdom. It debuted at number 3 in South Korea, number 11 in Japan, and number 17 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. The album sold over 470,000 copies in its release week and was certified platinum by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA). A limited edition vinyl version was released in December 2022. The album was made available on traditional CD format in 2023, with five additional tracks included.


Background and recording[edit]
J-Hope released his first solo mixtape, Hope World, on March 2, 2018. It peaked at number 38 on the US Billboard 200 and made him the highest-charting Korean soloist on the ranking at the time.[1][2] He did not release any new music for some time after that, citing disappointment with the mixtape as a reason during a livestream in January 2019. He further elaborated that a lack of confidence in his skills as a musician, especially in comparison to that of his bandmates, made him feel unprepared and hesitant to try collaborating with other artists. Despite these insecurities, the rapper also expressed feeling motivated by his bandmates' successes "to write great songs and want to work with great artists".[3] The trilingual "Chicken Noodle Soup" single, featuring American singer Becky G, followed in the latter part of the year.[4] No further releases were forthcoming. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 2021 about the likelihood of a second mixtape, J-Hope disclosed that he had been working on his music continuously, but nothing was decided as yet. His goal at present was "to get inspired and make good music." He added that Hope World's creation had greatly influenced his progression as a musician and artist since 2018, and while his style would not change much, it would be more mature.[5]
Recording sessions and mixing for the album took place at Hope World, The Rock Pit, Dogg Bounce and HYBE Studio in South Korea; Miss Lana Media and BC Mix in Los Angeles; The One With The Big Bulb; Sky Movement Studios in Barbados; Katalyst Studios in New York City; and Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood.[6]

Music and lyrical content[edit]
Jack in the Box represents J-Hope's "own musical personality and vision as an artist" and his "aspirations to break the mold and grow further".[7] In an interview for Weverse Magazine published in June 2022, the rapper divulged his desire to showcase a "different side of me...an extremely dark, raw side" in his current projects, in contrast to the "sunny demeanor" he often displays. He further elaborated that he "wanted to show I have things I want to say, but I kept feeling like, if I did them in the same style I always have, they wouldn't come across well. If I was going to convey the things I wanted to say, I would have to be darker. It's something I’ve never done before, so I was excited to try something new. I was heavily influenced by what my heart was telling me, and that's why I decided to give it a try."[8]
A concept album based on the Greek tale of Pandora's box, Jack in the Box opens with "Intro", a female-narrated reading of the story from which J-Hope's stagename is derived.[9] The existential "Pandora's Box", about the rapper's life as an idol, follows next. In it, he speaks about "serving others over himself"—the song's lyrics, "Someone's light, someone's smile/ Someone's hope, my activities are someone's life", "highlight the weight of his responsibility to his fans"—and questions his own perspectives.[10] The third track "More" is about J-Hope's "passion, bold ambition, and greed" to "show the world how much he has grown",[11][12] taking risks, and "a certain vital recklessness."[13] A 90s-inspired, "swag-filled" song with a "grungy rock 'n roll vibe"[13] that features a "darker, edgier sound"[12] in comparison to his previous releases, the track is a fusion of old-school hip hop and arena[14]/alt-rock.[12] It showcases the rapper's "unique rhythmic flow"[11] and utilizes "scream-singing".[15] The tenth track "Arson", is an introspective about him "encounter[ing] 'the world outside the box" while stuck at a crossroads and deciding which path to take next. Described in a press release as one of the main songs—together with "More"—that conveys the core message of Jack in the Box, it serves as the album's closing track.[16][17]

Release[edit]
On June 14, 2022, during the YouTube premiere of BTS' ninth anniversary dinner, RM revealed that the members would be devoting more attention to individual music endeavors going forward. Future projects would be released as commercial albums, complete with promotional activities, instead of as free or unpromoted mixtapes. Immediately afterwards, Hybe Corporation officially announced J-Hope as the first member to begin promoting as a solo artist.[18][19][20] A subsequent Weverse notice dated June 25, publicized the upcoming release of his debut album, Jack In the Box, scheduled for July 15. It would be preceded by a then-unnamed single on July 1.[21] J-Hope shared a short video clip of "a white J in the center of the screen, with a colorful checkered background" on his Instagram account, with the caption "'J'ack in the box", in honor of the album's announcement.[22] On June 27, he posted a set of concept images for the album's cover art, featuring various Pierrot motifs.[23] The first showed "a bird's eye view photo of him standing in a teal box" wearing a white suit and black Jester's hat "as he presses one finger to his lips", followed by four other photos of him in different poses inside the box.[22] Preorders for the album began online and at in-person retailers that same day.[24]
An "eerie" 23-second-long visualizer, titled Hope In The Box, of a jack-in-the-box cranking itself to the tune of a "somewhat sinister melody", was released on July 5. When the "Jack"-figure springs out, a static-filled television screen in the background begins flashing with similarly-themed graphics and words. J-Hope uploaded the clip to Instagram, with the caption "Are you just going to stay in the box?" and the hashtag "#HopeInTheBox".[25] Two days later, the album's complete 10-song tracklist was unveiled, via a graphic video on YouTube that listed out the tracks using "3D designs".[26]

Format[edit]
Hybe forwent releasing Jack in the Box on CD. Statements from the company explained that the decision was part of its efforts to reduce plastic waste, especially in relation to album production, and be more eco-friendly.[27] The album was made available digitally only, via various streaming platforms and music sites, as well as Hybe's own Weverse Albums music app. Though not packaged in a traditional format, some physical components are included: a card holder, two photocards, and a scanable User Guide QR card to access the album and additional digital content on Weverse Albums.[23]
A limited edition vinyl of the album was released on December 12, 2022. It includes a booklet, lyric sheet, folded poster, and photocard. The preorder period for the vinyl opened on Weverse and at other online retailers on August 8.[28] A CD version of the album, the HOPE Edition, comprising the same tracklist as the original release plus five new tracks: three live songs from J-Hope's Lollapalooza performance and two instrumentals, was released on August 18, 2023.[29] Four collectible editions were made available, including Target and Walmart exclusive versions.[30]

Singles[edit]
"More" was the first single released from the album. J-Hope shared two sets of related concept images, also containing Pierrot motifs,[23] via Instagram on June 27 and 28, 2022. The photos from the 27th depicted the rapper "in dark, smoky makeup"[31] "standing alone in a slanted hallway" and wearing "a floppy black jester's hat [while] staring into the bright-flash camera from different spots". Simply captioned "MORE ?", Big Hit Music confirmed this as the single's title in the text of the label's own posts of the concept images uploaded to its social media that same day.[22] The photos posted on the 28th featured J-Hope dressed in all white and surrounded by people with disfigured faces.[32] A 15-second video teaser, of a "silver key with the song's title etched into its face" backed by a percussive "'90s-inspired beat", containing a preview of the song's lyrics—the rapper is heard shouting the line "'Cause I want some more!'" at the end—followed on June 29.[33] An accompanying music video premiered simultaneously on YouTube in conjunction with the single's global digital release on July 1.[34] Critics positively highlighted "More"'s noticeable aural and visual departure from the brighter sounds and more vibrant imagery J-Hope had been known for up to that point,[12][13][35] and the "thunderous" expression of the rapper's  "shocking and theatrical new vision".[12][14] The single became his second solo entry on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, after 2019's "Chicken Noodle Soup", debuting at number 82 with 4.6 million cumulative streams and 12,000 copies sold—it was the second best-selling digital song in the country—during the tracking period dated July 1–7, 2022. "More" also earned J-Hope his third number-one on the genre-specific World Digital Song Sales chart and he topped the Emerging Artists chart for the first time.[36] Dazed ranked the song as the 15th best K-pop track of 2022 on its year-end list published in December, with Taylor Glasby writing that J-hope "bares his inner workings in 'More'" having "created a new lens through which to view him": as "a man whose creativity refuses to be tamed."[37] J-Hope later released a dance practice video, complete with choreography, for his stage performance of the song at the 2022 MAMA Awards.[38]
"Arson" was revealed as the second single from the album,[15] after J-Hope posted a silent video of himself on July 7 sitting before a black box with the word "ARSON" written on the front. Actually a candle, he stares into the camera after lighting it then covers the top of the box, snuffing the flame out.[16] Concept photos for the single followed on July 10 and 11, and showed the rapper dressed in a white jumpsuit posing next to a wrecked, burning car, and then with his clothing charred.[39][40] A 30-second teaser for the single's music video was shared via YouTube on the 13th. Directed by Lee Suho, the clip features a car exploding into fire in slow motion while J-Hope is heard saying "'let's burn … it's done'" before briefly rapping in Korean and then name-dropping the song's title, all over a "shuffling beat". The single's release date—the same day as the album—appeared at the end.[40] J-Hope earned his third solo entry on the US Hot 100, at number 96, with "Arson", and his fourth number-one debut on the World Digital Song Sales chart.
Both singles were later nominated in the Global Digital Music – July category at the 12th Circle Chart Music Awards.[41]

Promotion[edit]
On July 13, 2022, W Korea announced J-Hope as the cover for the magazine's August issue—three versions were released. The magazine contained a full spread pictorial and an in-depth interview with the rapper about his music and Jack in the Box.[42] He also discussed the album with Rolling Stone, Variety, and Consequence in articles published on July 15.[43][44][45] J-Hope held a private listening party for the album at the Hybe headquarters in Yongsan on July 14. Attendees included BTS-bandmates Jin, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, Hybe chairman Bang Si-hyuk, and several of the rapper's close friends and artists in the dance and music industries such as Tiger JK, Yoon Mi-rae, Uhm Jung-hwa, Heize, Jessi, Hyuna, Sunmi, Simon Dominic, Loco, and Sokodomo. Clips of the event were shared online by multiple attendees.[43][46] On July 28, J-Hope appeared as a guest on the 14th episode of IU's Palette, a YouTube series hosted by singer IU. He performed "Equal Sign", as a duet with IU, and "Safety Zone" for the first time on the show.[47][48] The rapper made his solo performance debut at Lollapalooza on July 31, as the headlining act for the final day of the event, and became the first South Korean artist to headline a main stage at a major United States music festival[49]—the hour-long setlist included several songs from the album.[43] In November, J-Hope headlined day two of the MAMA Awards in Japan, performing a medley of "More", "Arson", and "Future".[50][51] The following month, he joined the performance lineup for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve, held on December 31, and sang a medley comprising "= (Equal Sign)", "Chicken Noodle Soup", and the Holiday Remix version of "Butter" by BTS.[52]
A documentary chronicling the album's making and J-Hope's performance at Lollapalooza, titled J-Hope in the Box, was released for streaming globally on Weverse and Disney+ beginning February 17, 2023.[53]

Critical reception[edit]

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, Jack in the Box received an average score of 87 based on six reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[54] In a 5-star review for NME, Rhian Daly wrote that the album was "smartly presented with a clearly signposted narrative" and "flows in a way that makes it a treat to enjoy from start to finish rather than dipping into songs at random."[58] She described it as "thought-provoking and full of fresh new flavour", noting that while "J-Hope might have taken off his bright, optimistic mask...to show another dimension of his character [...] those qualities [...] still creep in here in places, pushing forward his empathetic, sincere messages with glimmers of positivity.[58] Clash's Abbie Aitken complimented J-Hope's "experiment[ation] with genres not normally associated with his artistry", describing the change as "refreshing" and "resulting in a second album that completely juxtaposes his previous sound." In sentiments similar to Daly's, she also noticed "glimpses of the radiancy often associated with [the rapper]" surfacing throughout the album "despite an extremely darkened start".[56] The Evening Standard's Jochan Embley described the album as "a solid start", impressed with the constant changeup of J-Hope's vocal delivery and the "almost imperceptibl[e]" switching between Korean and English, but felt that the overall shortness of the record made it come across "more like a proof of concept than a fully realised album." He singled out "Equal Sign" and "Safety Zone" as the "rays of light" countering "the gloomier pits" of the rapper's personality in "the rest of the album's darkness."[57]

Commercial performance[edit]
Jack in the Box debuted at number three in South Korea, on the week 31 issue—for the period dated July 24–30, 2022—of the Circle Album Chart[61] and subsequently ranked at number eight on the monthly album chart for July, having sold 472,385 cumulative copies.[62] A further 9,614 copies were sold in August,[62] and the album was awarded Platinum certification by the Korea Music Content Association (KMCA) in September.[63]
In Japan, with only three days of availability, Jack in the Box debuted at number two on Oricon's weekly Digital Albums Chart for the period dated July 11–17, 2022, selling 2,439 copies within that time.[64] It also entered the corresponding issue of the Billboard Japan Hot Albums chart at number 11,[65] and was the best-selling digital album of the week, topping the component Download Albums chart with 2,425 sales.[66]
The album also earned J-Hope entries on several Billboard charts in the United States. It debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200 chart issue dated July 30 (for the tracking week ending July 21) with 25,000 units sold, his second and highest entry on the ranking—Hope World previously peaked at number 38 in 2018.[67][68] Of that figure, the album sold 10,000 digital copies and was the fifth best-selling release of the week.[69] J-Hope also re-entered the Artist 100, at a new peak of number nine.[67] Following the global release of the vinyl version, the album entered Billboard's Vinyl Albums chart at number eight, on the issue dated January 28, 2023.[70] It reentered the February 11 issue of the chart, at a new peak of number four, following the vinyl's release in the US.[71] The HOPE Edition version of the album, released in August 2023, earned 50,000 album-equivalent units during the week ending August 24 and reentered the Billboard 200 (issue dated September 2) at number six. This figure comprised 47,000 pure sales; 2,000 stream-equivalent album units (2.99 million on-demand official streams); and 1,000 track-equivalent album units.[30]

Accolades[edit]
Rolling Stone included Jack in the Box on its year-end list of the 100 Best Albums of 2022 at number nine, describing it as a "growly, endlessly creative debut" that "set the bar high",[72] while NME listed the album at number 42 on its ranking of the 50 best albums of 2022, writing that it "takes the J-Hope the world has come to know and love over the last nine years and sets that figure alight. From the ashes, though, comes a star more thrilling and formidable than ever."[73] In September 2023, Paste magazine ranked Jack in the Box as the second-greatest K-pop album of all time on the publication's list of the 30 Greatest K-Pop Albums of All Time.[74]
The album was nominated in the respective Bonsang categories at the 37th Golden Disc Awards and 32nd Seoul Music Awards,[75][76] but did not win.[77][78]

Percy Turnbull (14 July 1902 – 9 December 1976) was an English composer and pianist best known for his piano character pieces and songs.[1]


Life[edit]
Percy Purvis Turnbull trained as a chorister at the Cathedral Church of St Nicholas in Newcastle and took piano lessons from Sigmund Oppenheimer. After leaving school in 1916 he began working for the Tyne Improvement Commission, but kept up his musical interests in his spare time, encouraged by one of the leading musicians of the area, William Gillies Whittaker, founder and conductor of the Newcastle Bach Choir. He won a scholarship to attend the Royal College of Music in 1923 and studied there with Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and John Ireland.[2] While there he won the Mendelssohn Scholarship and Arthur Sullivan Prize for his composition. He also began to give piano recitals and worked as an accompanist for 2LO and early BBC radio.
After college, Turnbull took on a variety of musically-related jobs, editing piano rolls at the Aeolian Company (where his boss was Percy Scholes), playing for the Empire Theatre in Swansea and working as a music copyist for Hubert Foss at the Oxford University Press, as well as teaching piano.[3] In 1941 he began serving in the Royal Artillery, manning anti-aircraft batteries on the East Yorkshire coast.[4]
After the war he became principal piano teacher at the Surrey College of Music in Ewell, the most settled period of his career, which lasted until the College closed in 1956. From then until the end of his life Turnbull lived with his second wife Mary Parnell in Broomers Hill, Pulborough, Sussex, close enough for frequent visits to see his friend John Ireland, living ten miles away in his windmill near Steyning.[3] He stopped composing in 1960 and took up watercolours.[5]

Music[edit]
As a composer, Percy Turnbull was influenced by the standard classical repertoire (Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms) he learned as a pianist and taught to his pupils. This was tempered by an enthusiasm for the Russian pianist composers Scriabin, Rachmaninov and Medtner, as well as the Francophile influence of Faure and Ravel, and also something of his friend and teacher John Ireland.[6]
Starting at the RCM he began composing in all forms. A string quartet won first prize in the Newcastle Music Tournament and was performed there on 8 February 1923.[7] An orchestral Northumbrian Rhapsody for orchestra was first performed by the London Symphony Orchestra at a Patrons' Fund Concert conducted by Sir Adrian Boult in 1925, and the piece was broadcast from London about a year later. His most extended instrumental work, the Violin Sonata, also dates from 1925 when it was played by Marie Wilson with Turnbull as pianist at the Royal College of Music.[8][9]
But after that he composed mostly piano music and songs with piano accompaniment.[2] Few were published in his lifetime, but there are eleven volumes of piano music posthumously published by the Turnbull Memorial Trust, including Seven Character Sketches (1923–1927), a five movement Piano Suite (1925), Six Preludes (1934–41), the Sonatina (1948), Three Winter Pieces (1951) and the Pasticcio on a theme of Mozart (1957) - the latter applying the styles of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Brahms, Fauré, Ravel, Delius and Bartok to the original Mozart theme.[10] There are also two volumes of songs and partsongs. Peter Jacobs performed a selection of the piano music on a SOMM CD released in 2000,[11] and a CD of the songs and partsongs followed in 2001.[12]

A memory institution is an organization maintaining a repository of public knowledge, a generic term used about institutions such as libraries, archives, heritage (monuments & sites) institutions, aquaria and arboreta, and zoological and botanical gardens, as well as providers of digital libraries and data aggregation services which serve as memories for given societies or mankind.[1] Memory institutions serve the purpose of documenting, contextualizing, preserving and indexing elements of human culture and collective memory. These institutions allow and enable society to better understand themselves, their past, and how the past impacts their future.[2]  These repositories are ultimately preservers of communities, languages, cultures, customs, tribes, and individuality.[1] Memory institutions are repositories of knowledge, while also being actors of the transitions of knowledge and memory to the community. These institutions ultimately remain some form of collective memory.[1] Increasingly such institutions are considered as a part of a unified documentation and information science perspective.
Archives are repositories that collect, organize, preserve, and allow for access to the institution's primary source materials which include letters, reports, accounts, minute books, photographs, and manuscripts of the government, businesses, and members of the community.[3]  Most archival collections include permanent and valuable records of historical and evidential value. Archives fall in line with memory institutions because they provide surrogates for collective human memory. Archives collect materials to help communities, institutions, nations to better understand themselves, their past, understand the present and prepare for the future.[3] Libraries are defined as a collection of resources that are made available to the community in the form of print materials such as books and periodicals by information professionals. Beyond books and periodicals, libraries also offer a variety of services and programs to the community in which they serve with the goal of educating and advancing society.[4] Museums are a place where objects that contain permanent historical and cultural value such as works of art, three-dimensional objects, and scientific specimens.  Museum can be characterized as historical, scientific, art institutions, heritage institutions, aquaria and arboreta, and zoological and botanical gardens.[5]
Lorcan Dempsey may have introduced the term into popular use at the beginning of the 21st century in library and information science,[6] although others, such as Joan Schwarz, used it earlier.[7] It also appeared in a 1972 report to the Council on Library Resources.[8]
Helena Robinson (2012) criticized the term when she wrote, "[r]ather than revealing the essential affiliation between museums, libraries and archives, their sweeping classification as 'memory institutions' in the public sector and the academy oversimplifies the concept of memory, and marginalises domain-specific approaches to the cataloguing, description, interpretation and deployment of collections that lead museums, libraries and archives to engage with history, meaning and memory in significantly different ways."[9]

Memory institutions in the Digital Age[edit]
The primary goals of memory institutions are to preserve and document the memory of society, but also to allow open access to collections. In the digital age, memory institutions are faced with the task of digitizing their analogue collections as well as taking in born digital materials. Digitization is the process of transforming analogue materials into a digital format primarily for storage and use on a computer.[10] Digitization in memory institutions allows for great access to the repositories' collections at any time and from anywhere around the world. The digitization of collections in memory institutions assists with preservations concerns. With collections being made available online, the materials are faced with less abuse from being handled regularly.[11] Another important factor with digitization is that it can decentralize and democratize memory institutions and social remembering practices.[12]
While there are several positive aspects when digitizing collections in memory intuitions there are some cons to consider. One of strains on digitization for memory institutions is the cost that has to be considered. Digital collections will still need maintenance and updated as technology and software changes. The institutions' staff have to be properly trained to deal with digitization and changing technologies. Digitization projects can take a lot of time, money, and resources from institutions that are already lacking these things.[13] Having collections available online will lead to reduced access and engagement to the physical collection, which the user might prefer. Memory institutions also need to consider the legal ramifications such as copyright and data protection. Ethics and privacy concerns with digital collections also need to be considered. There is also a fear that people will not come to the memory institutions because they can do their research or gain their knowledge from their online presence.[13]

The Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue of Montreal, also known as Shearith Israel, is an Orthodox synagogue, located at 4894 Avenue Saint-Kevin in Snowdon, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The synagogue is the oldest Jewish congregation in Canada. The congregation traces its history from 1760 and was formally established in 1768.[1] It is affiliated with the Orthodox Union.


Architecture[edit]
By 1777 the Jewish community in Montreal felt itself able to erect and support a synagogue. Lazarus David had died in 1776 but on August 14, 1777 his widow, Phoebe, sold for 1200 French livres part of David's property to three of the congregation's leading members, Samuel Judah, Simon Levy and Andrew Hays, recently married to her daughter Abigail (Branny). The building, completed the following year, stood behind a low stone wall, had a high red roof, and was located at the junction of Little St. James and Notre Dame Streets, a site now partially occupied by the Palais de justice.
The congregation's second building, also the second synagogue built in Quebec, was constructed on Chenneville Street in 1838. The Judeo-Egyptian style temple-like building had a front of cut stone, adorned with a portico with two columns. This was the only formal place for Jewish worship in Montreal until 1846. Charles T. Ballard, architect, designed a new and larger synagogue for the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation on Stanley Street in the Egyptian Revival style of architecture in 1887–1890.[2]
The congregation has been housed in its fourth premises in Snowdon, part of Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough, since 1947.
In the sanctuary, Torah is read to the congregation from the bimah and the Torah scrolls are stored in the aron kodesh on the east wall. The congregation faces towards the east, and Jerusalem, in praying. The ornamentation features symbols such as Stars of David, signs of the zodiac and natural forms.[3]

"Homenatge a Joan Brossa" in Barcelona
Joan Brossa (Catalan pronunciation: [ʒuˈam ˈbɾɔsə]; 19 January 1919 – 30 December 1998) was a Catalan poet, playwright, graphic designer and visual artist.[1] He wrote only in the Catalan language.
He was one of the founders of both the group and the publication known as Dau-al-Set (1948) and one of the leading early proponents of visual poetry in Catalan literature. Although he was in the vanguard of the post-war poets, he also wrote hundreds of formally perfect sonnets, sapphic odes, and sestinas as well as thousands of free and direct poems. His creative work embraced every aspect of the arts: cinema, theatre (more than 360 pieces), music, cabaret, the para-theatrical arts, magic, and the circus.


Life and work[edit]
For him, expression had priority over content, and he managed to give his poetry the appearance of plays on words. His lyrical work is connected with the theatre while the totality of his literature (more of 80 books, all written in the Catalan language) is impregnated with the theatrical dimension as he always employed a broad and interdisciplinary vision of culture, the arts in general and the performance arts in particular.  This vision was expressed in his literary and visual works which often appeared as satirical, cutting, ironic and critical or, on other occasions, irreverent yet playful. In the latter years of his creative life, he received a number of awards such as the National Prize for the Visual Arts (1992), the National Theatre Prize (1998) and the UNESCO Picasso Medal. He has been posthumously awarded doctorate honoris causa from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (1999). He was a member and then Honorary Member of the Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana (Association of Catalan Language Writers). His visual poetry (poesia plàstica), obviously placed beyond all linguistic borders, is recognized as a reference the world over.

He collaborated in the foundation of the Espai Escenic Joan Brossa (The Joan Brossa Theatrical Space) in the Born district of Barcelona, this being the initiative of the theatre director and actor Hermann Bonnín and the magician Hausson, who continued along the theatrical lines espoused by Brossa.[2]

Floral arrangement with the coat of arms of Barcelona, gardens of Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer.
The parks and gardens of Barcelona cover an area of 2,784 hectares.[Note 1] Its management depends on the Municipal Institute of Parks and Gardens of Barcelona (in Catalan: Institut Municipal de Parcs i Jardins de Barcelona), a body under the Barcelona City Council. Since the 19th century —and especially in the 20th century— Barcelona has been committed to the development of green areas in the city, and is currently one of the European cities with the most roadside trees (150,000 units).[1] In 2001 the Institute of Parks and Gardens received ISO 14001 certification for the conservation and management of green spaces and public roadside trees.[2]
Gardening in Barcelona has had an uneven evolution over time: the first significant project, the Labyrinth of Horta park, dates back to the 18th century; the first large public park in Barcelona, the Citadel, was opened in the 19th century; but most of the green areas in the city date from the 20th century, a period in which public gardening in the Catalan capital was given a great boost. In this last century gardening has developed mainly in four phases: the first planning carried out by Léon Jaussely in his plan of connections and by Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, author of an ambitious plan of concentric green areas throughout the city, from Montjuïc to the Besòs; the post-war period saw a setback in the creation of green spaces, mainly due to real estate speculation that led to an increase in the population due to immigration, as well as the priority given to road traffic due to the increase in the number of cars. With the arrival of democracy there was a new impulse to the creation of landscaped spaces, with a predominance of architectural design and a multipurpose sense of space, which added to the plant element service areas and leisure and recreational facilities for the population; finally, towards the end of the century a more naturalistic trend emerged, more in line with the new ideas of ecology and environmental sustainability, with concern not only for parks and large green areas but also for the placement of groves in streets and promenades of the city.[3]
Depending on their characteristics, Barcelona's parks and gardens are divided into several typologies: "historical", those created before 1950, such as the Parc del Laberint d'Horta, the Parc de la Ciutadella, Parc Güell, the gardens of the University of Barcelona, those of Laribal and those of the Palau Reial de Pedralbes; "thematic", which are dedicated to a certain type of plant species, such as the Parc de Cervantes, dedicated to roses, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera gardens, specialized in cacti and succulents, and the Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer gardens, dedicated to aquatic, bulbous and rhizomatous plants; "urban" are the most common type, parks and gardens located in the city and open to all public, with services and multipurpose spaces for the enjoyment of all citizens; and "forest", green spaces of wide extension generally located in areas bordering the city, such as the Sierra de Collserola and the mountain of Montjuïc.[4]


Characteristics[edit]

Barcelona, capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, is located in the Spanish Levante region, on the Mediterranean coast. It is located on a plain about 11 km long and 6 km wide, bounded on its sides by the sea and by the Sierra de Collserola —with the summit of Tibidabo (516.2 m) as its highest point— as well as by the deltas of the Besòs and Llobregat rivers.[5] The city's climate is Mediterranean, of the sub-humid maritime xeophytic type, with an average annual temperature of 16.4 °C and a relative humidity of 70%. Rainfall is mainly between October and April, scarce in winter and minimal in summer, with rainfall of 578.74 l/m2 (1997-2002).[6]
The vegetation is Mediterranean, with a predominance of perennial species. The typical forest is encinar (Quercus ilex), and there are also some subtropical species, which need constant irrigation to live outdoors, such as the naranjo (Citrus × sinensis), limonero (Citrus × limon), mimosa (Acacia dealbata), araucaria (Araucaria heterophylla), eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus) and palm (Phoenix dactylifera). Some species originating in Japan, which has a climate similar to the Mediterranean but with more rainfall in summer, have been acclimatized, such as the pittosporum (Pittosporum tobira) and the spindle (Euonymus japonicus). Of conifers, the most adaptable is the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica), as well as cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) and thuja (Thuja standishii). Species from other regions of the world with Mediterranean climates, such as California, South Africa, Australia and Chile, have also adapted.[7]
In relation to each specific area of the city, vegetation can vary according to climatic conditions, water resources, altitude, sun exposure, erosion levels, rainfall and wind action. In favorable conditions, species such as pine (Pinus pinea), holm oak (Quercus ilex) and wild olive (Olea europaea sylvestris) predominate; in less favorable conditions, there are phytosystems called maquis, with trees such as the carob tree (Ceratonia siliqua) and the palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera), or shrubs such as the strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), the laurel (Laurus nobilis), the myrtle (Myrtus communis), the rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) or the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus); and in unfavorable conditions, there is garrigue-type vegetation, with free soil and little growth, with xerophytic species such as the gayomba (Spartium junceum), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and salvia (Salvia officinalis).[8]

The city's tree grove is composed of a total of 140 species, of which the most common are: plane tree (Platanus x hispanica), honeyberry (Celtis australis), elm (Ulmus pumila), Japanese acacia (Sophora japonica), acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia), rosewood (Tipuana tipu), "bottle tree" (Brachychiton populneum), Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra italica), Japanese privet (Ligustrum lucidum), chinaberry tree (Melia azedarach), black maple (Acer negundo) and bitter orange (Citrus aurantium).[9]
In 1983 the Barcelona City Council initiated a Catalog of Trees of Local Interest, which classifies a group of trees, palms and shrubs that have special relevance due to their botanical value, historical interest or any other significant component for the conservation of the city's green areas. These trees are specially protected, as they cannot be uprooted or affected by any urban development operation. The choice of catalogued species is made by means of a series of parameters that analyze each specimen according to aspects such as age, measurements, history or aesthetic qualities (see here the list of trees of local interest).[10]
The actions of the Municipal Institute of Parks and Gardens have focused for years on sustainability criteria, especially with regard to the planting of native Mediterranean species, more adaptable to the terrain and less hydraulic consumption; irrigation carried out with groundwater or automated irrigation (208 hectares in 2001), where the use of irrigation controlled by hygrometers is being introduced;[11] and the use of organic waste composting for fertilization.[12]

Pruning work.
Plant species are cared for according to their typology: in trees and palms, work is focused on pruning, whether it is formation, cleaning or raising the crown, or cleaning dry leaves in the case of palms, in addition to phytosanitary treatments in all these specimens; grass is the one that requires more continuous treatment, mainly mowing, as well as trimming the edges to maintain its structure, and more sporadically the aeration, priming and fertilizing of flowerbeds; as for ground cover and perennials, the former are pruned in winter, early spring and late summer, while the latter require pruning and trimming, as well as a replacement by division of bushes every two or three years; hedges need formation pruning, and maintenance with trimming in early winter and autumn; shrubs are pruned twice a year, in early summer and winter; flowers require constant care, the planting soil is usually prepared first —during the months of April, August and November—, the soil is weeded every month to aerate it and, three times a year, dried flowers are removed; In addition, general maintenance work is carried out throughout the year, such as weeding, repairing the paths and repairing or replacing street furniture, as well as general cleaning and emptying of litter garbage cans.[13]
Another area of vital importance is phytosanitary treatments, planned according to biodiversity and integrated pest management criteria. They are divided into six modalities: cultural, through the selection of species; mechanical, through controlled pruning; biological control, with the use of certain organisms that work against parasites, through the artificial introduction of useful fauna or antagonistic microorganisms; pheromone traps, which work against a sector of the attacking species; chromatic bands, which, like flowers, attract insects; and chemical methods, which can be by plant endotherapy, consisting of the pressurized injection of the phytosanitary product into the plant, or by atomization and phytosanitary applications on the plant.[14]
The Institute of Parks and Gardens also manages a network of urban vegetable gardens in collaboration with groups of retired people, who are responsible for their maintenance and harvesting. These are plots of between 25 and 40 m2, in which vegetables and greens are grown, as well as aromatic and medicinal plants, and some seasonal flowers. There are currently 13 urban gardens scattered throughout the city.[15]

History[edit]
The Labyrinth of Horta Park is the oldest garden preserved in the city.
The first traces of gardening in the city come from the Middle Ages, a period in which the garden was mainly found in monastic enclosures, where a garden and a water well were usually located in the cloister, as well as in castles and palaces, where the secular (or "courtly") garden emerged, of small proportions, generally structured from the orchard, around a fountain or pond, with stone benches to sit on. In some gardens of royal palaces the custom arose of housing animals such as ducks, swans or peacocks, sometimes becoming small zoos that could house more exotic animals, such as lions and leopards, as in the garden of the Queen of the Lesser Royal Palace of Barcelona.[17] From the Gothic period a garden courtyard of the Grand Royal Palace of Barcelona (now the Frederic Marès Museum) is preserved, as well as the Orange Tree Courtyard of the Palace of the Generalitat de Catalunya.[18] The cloister of the Cathedral of Barcelona retains its double bowl fountain in the center, with a Gothic pavilion at one angle, and a garden enclosed by iron railings, with palms, magnolias and other ancient trees, and a pond called Fuente de las Ocas (Fountain of the Gooseberries).[19]

Paseo Nuevo or Paseo de la Explanada, in front of the Citadel, created in 1797 and disappeared before 1888. In the foreground, the fountain of the Nereida, in the background the fountain of Hercules.
However, the first surviving gardens in the city date back to the 18th century. In terms of urban planning, this period saw the opening of promenades in many Spanish cities, inspired by the French boulevard typology, as in the case of La Rambla in Barcelona.[20] But the most outstanding achievement of this period is the Labyrinth Park of Horta, a neoclassical garden created on the initiative of Joan Antoni Desvalls, sixth Marquis of Llupià, and built by the Italian architect Domenico Bagutti and the French gardener Joseph Delvalet between 1794 and 1808.[21]
At the end of the 18th century, the Paseo Nuevo or Paseo de la Explanada was opened next to the military Citadel, a wide avenue lined with poplars and elms and decorated with ornamental fountains —of which the fountain of Hercules is still preserved—. For a time it was the main green space of the city, but it disappeared during the works to prepare the park of the Citadel for the Universal Exposition of 1888.[22]

Garden of the General.
The first public parks appeared in the 19th century, due to the phenomenon of the Industrial Revolution, which led to an increase in urban environments, sometimes in conditions of environmental degradation due to poor hygienic conditions and increased pollution by the increasingly abundant industrialization. To alleviate these effects, the creation of large urban gardens and parks was promoted, which were paid for by the public authorities, thus giving rise to a "public gardening" that was gradually differentiated from the private comitencia that until then had monopolized the large gardening projects; this led to the introduction of the concept of landscape architecture, as well as the development of urban planning.[23]
The first public garden in Barcelona was created in 1816: the Garden of the General, an initiative of the Captain General of Catalonia, Francisco Javier Castaños. It was located between the present-day Avinguda Marquès de l'Argentera and the Citadel, in front of where the Estació de França is today, and covered an area of 0.4 hectares. Unfortunately, this space disappeared in 1877.[24]
During the 19th century, the opening of promenades and avenues continued, such as the Passeig de Gràcia, whose works began in 1821 with the planting of acacias, plane trees, poplars, mulberry trees, oleanders and holm oaks.[25] In this promenade were located several gardens, such as the Tívoli gardens, between Valencia and Consejo de Ciento streets, which had a nursery of flowers and aromatic plants;[26] the jardí dels Camps Elisis, between Aragon and Roussillon streets, which had a garden, a lake with boats, a theater and an amusement park with roller coasters;[27] other gardens were the Criadero, Ninfa, Euterpe and Prado Catalán. These gardens disappeared a few years later when Passeig de Gràcia was urbanized.

Garden and amusement park of the jardí dels Camps Elisis, Passeig de Gràcia, installed in 1853 and disappeared before 1877.
At that time there were also several projects for the reform and ensanche of cities, which among other factors multiplied the space of green areas for the use and enjoyment of the population, such as the expansion of Barcelona, with a design by Ildefonso Cerdá (1860), which included a green area inside each block of houses, although in most cases it was never built, mainly due to real estate speculation. In 1872, after the demolition of the walls of the fortress of the Citadel, the Barcelona City Council organized a competition to build the first large public park in the city, the Parc de la Ciutadella. The project was commissioned to Josep Fontserè, who designed extensive gardens for the recreation of the citizens, under the slogan "gardens are to cities what lungs are to the human body". Ramón Oliva, director of Barcelona's public gardens since 1874, was in charge of the gardening work. This park would be the main nucleus of the subsequent Universal Exposition of 1888.[28]
Between the 19th and 20th centuries modernism emerged,[Note 2] a movement that gave special relevance to design and architecture as a global work, both exterior and interior, with an anti-classical language inherited from romanticism, a strong link between architecture and the applied arts, and a markedly ornamental style.[29] Its main exponent was Antoni Gaudí, who in addition to being an architect was also an urban planner and landscape designer, with a personal style based on the observation of nature.[30] Gaudí had a great knowledge of botany and geomorphology, and although he was a great advocate of the use of Mediterranean vegetation, especially the type of sclerophyllous forest typical of the Mediterranean area, such as pines and oaks, he also used allochthonous species such as palms, mimosas and eucalyptus.[31] Many of his projects included gardens, such as the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions, but Gaudí's main garden project was the Parc Güell (1900-1914), commissioned by his patron, Count Eusebi Güell, to build a residential development in the style of the English garden cities, located on the so-called Montaña Pelada, in La Salut district of Barcelona.[32] In 1984 Unesco included Parc Güell in the World Heritage Site "Works of Antoni Gaudí".[33]

With the arrival of the 20th century, the Barcelona City Council organized a competition for a plan of connections between the Eixample and the municipalities recently added to the city, won in 1905 by Léon Jaussely, who designed a plan that foresaw large road infrastructures (promenades, diagonals, promenades), parks, rail links and service areas. Although it was only partially realized, it inspired Barcelona's urban planning for much of the century. In the first decades of the 20th century, thanks to the impulse of a new exhibition, the 1929 International Exposition, the Montjuïc mountain was developed with a project by the French landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, author of the Maria Luisa park in Seville, where he brought into fashion the so-called "neo-Sevillian style", characterized by the use of brick and tile, and where water and the use of elements such as pergolas and trellises, as well as stairs and terraces to dynamize the grounds, are essential. Forestier was a proponent of the garden as a work of art, and among his premises was the maximum use of local resources, so in his works in Spain he worked essentially with Mediterranean vegetation, although he also introduced some species from South America, where he had worked, such as the tipuana, the jacaranda and the ombú.[34] In Montjuïc he had the collaboration of Nicolau Maria Rubió i Tudurí, architect and landscape designer, with whom he created a complex with a markedly Mediterranean character and classicist taste, centered on the Laribal (1917-1924) and Miramar (1919-1923) gardens. The team formed by Forestier and Rubió left several other works in the city, such as the landscaping of the Plaza de Armas in the Parc de la Ciutadella (1915) and the Parc del Guinardó (1918). On the other hand, the Botanical Garden of Barcelona was established in 1930, located at the bottom of a quarry behind the National Palace of Montjuïc, with a magnificent collection of exotic plants compiled by the botanist Pius Font i Quer.[35]

Parc Güell, work of Antoni Gaudí.
Rubió i Tudurí was the leading representative of Noucentisme, a movement for the renovation of culture that sought to bring it closer to the innovations produced in the new 20th century, and which, contrary to the Nordic values defended by modernism, advocated a return to the Mediterranean world, to classical Greco-Latin culture. Director of Parks and Gardens of Barcelona between 1917 and 1937, he was the main promoter of the "Mediterranean garden", which is denoted in his works such as the gardens of the Francesc Macià square (1925), the Font del Racó park (1926), the gardens of the Royal Palace of Pedralbes (1927), those of Turó Park (1933) and those of the Gaudí square, in front of the Sagrada Familia (1981). Rubió i Tudurí founded in 1933 the Municipal School of Apprentice Gardeners, currently the Rubió i Tudurí Municipal Secondary School. In 1926 he proposed with the text El problema de los espacios libres —presented at the XI National Congress of Architects— the placement of a series of green spaces in the form of concentric semicircles between the Besós and Llobregat rivers, all along the Siera de Collserola, with small enclaves in the inner part of the city in the style of the London squares; unfortunately, the project was not executed, except in small portions.[36]

Parc de Cervantes.
The Civil War brought the city's landscaping projects to a halt, and in the post-war period the actions focused more on the maintenance and restoration of existing areas than on the creation of new green zones. In 1940, Lluís Riudor i Carol, the initiator of landscaping in Catalonia, was put in charge of Parks and Gardens.[37] His works included the Austria Garden —located in the Parc Güell area—, the Monterols Park, the Cervantes Park, and several interventions in the Montjuïc mountain aimed at suppressing the shantytowns produced by immigration in the post-war period, This project was continued by his successor, Joaquim Casamor, with the creation of several thematic gardens, such as the Mossèn Costa i Llobera gardens, specialized in cacti and succulents, and the Mossèn Cinto Verdaguer gardens, dedicated to aquatic, bulbous and rhizomatous plants.[35] His work also included the Mirador del Alcalde gardens on Montjuïc and the Joan Maragall gardens, located around the Albeniz Palace, residence of the Spanish royal family during their visits to Barcelona, in neoclassical style; and, in the rest of Barcelona, the Putget, Guineueta and Villa Amelia parks.[38] During this period, the Barcelona City Council also purchased several private properties that were incorporated into the public parks, such as the Horta Labyrinth Park (1971), the Castell de l'Oreneta Park (1978) and the Aigües Park (1978).[24]

The arrival of democracy favored the creation of new green areas in the city. At this time, gardening was closely linked to urban planning, with a concept that combined aesthetics with functionality, as well as recreational aspects, sports facilities, services for certain groups such as children —children's playgrounds— or the elderly —pétanque courts as the most recurrent element—, or even the commercial vision —food and beverage establishments—. In this sense, green areas were usually subordinated to the architectural layout of the complex, losing to a large extent the naturalness of the vegetation, which on many occasions had a certain artificial appearance. In relation to this, perennial and static species such as conifers gained preponderance and were used on a massive scale in the new urban parks.[39] At that time numerous parks were converted from former municipal facilities, such as the Joan Miró park, built in 1983 on the site of the former central slaughterhouse of Barcelona, or in industrial areas (España Industrial park, 1985; Pegaso park, 1986; Clot park, 1986) or from former railway facilities (Sant Martí park, 1985; Estación del Norte park, 1988). As in the previous period, several private properties were acquired, such as the gardens of Villa Cecilia (1986) and the gardens of Ca n'Altimira (1991).[24]

Hotel of bees and wasps, Cervantes Park.
In the 1990s, the predisposition to a greater contact with nature returned, and there was a growing awareness of the damage done to the environment. Since then, the defense of nature and ecological values has been increasing in society, which has resulted in greater efforts to conserve the natural heritage and in the design of new gardens with greater relevance of vegetation and its location in the environment. Barcelona has been a clear example in this sense, since, especially thanks to the impulse of the 1992 Olympic Games, it initiated a process of restoration and conservation of its parks and gardens, while at the same time new ones were created with a more naturalistic design, such as the Creueta del Coll park, in addition to the actions on the seafront and in the new neighborhood of the Olympic Village. On Montjuïc, the epicenter of the Games, a new 14-hectare Botanical Garden was installed, dedicated to Mediterranean plants from all over the world, the work of Carlos Ferrater and Bet Figueras, and the Sculpture Garden was established next to the Miró Foundation, with works by sculptors such as Tom Carr, Pep Durán, Perejaume, Enric Pladevall, Jaume Plensa, Josep Maria Riera i Aragó, Erna Verlinden and Sergi Aguilar. In 2003 the Joan Brossa gardens were inaugurated, located on the land formerly occupied by the Montjuïc Amusement Park, with a remodeling carried out by Patrizia Falcone in landscape style.[40] Other playgrounds were the Mirador del Migdia, Poblenou, Carlos I and Valle de Hebron parks.
In the 21st century there was a new boost to gardening with the celebration of the Universal Forum of Cultures 2004 in the Diagonal Mar area, which left a new green area of 214 hectares, with gardens such as the Garcia Fària Linear Park, the Forum Park and the Diagonal Mar Park.[24] In the second decade of the century, the construction of two large parks is planned, which will significantly increase the green space of the city: the Glories Park and the Sagrera Park.[41]
During Ada Colau's mayoralty, a program of naturalization and ecological management of the city's green spaces was promoted, with the aim of increasing the green surface area and promoting biodiversity. Among other actions, vegetation was increased, native species were protected, trees were pruned less frequently and plants were allowed to grow in the tree wells. The goal was to increase green spaces by 160 hectares by 2030, with a target of 1 m2 per person. In addition to increasing green spaces, 80 insect facilities and more than 260 bird nests were installed. The use of chemical herbicides was also eliminated and phytosanitary treatments were reduced.[42]

Federation for a Democratic China (FDC Chinese: 民主中國陣線) is a Canada based political group that advocates the democratization of China through opposition of the Chinese Communist Party and the support of human rights. It was founded on September 22, 1989 in Paris, France, following the 1989 Tiananmen Square Protests.
The group has members all over the world, including mainland China. Active members are located in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Thailand and in other European and Asian countries.
The group was very active in the five years following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and has been substantially reinvigorated and active since 2003 with large congresses attracting a broad cross-section of leading Chinese Democracy Activists and exiles.[2]
In 2005 Chen Yonglin, then Chinese consulate-general working in Sydney, defected to the Australian government by a formal claim for political asylum. Chen claimed that a network of 1,000 Chinese government spies were operating in Australia, leading the chairman of the Australian branch of the FDC to comment that such claims could "lead to [an] atmosphere of distrust and even antagonism towards the Chinese community."[3]
On October 8, 2012, during the 11th Congress of FDC, Sheng Xue, who lives in Canada was elected as the President of the FDC. She was the first female president of the FDC, and the first female president of any major organization in the overseas Chinese pro-democracy movement.
On March 24, 2017, during the 13th Congress of FDC, Chin Jin, who lives in Australia, was elected as President. Jin Xiuhong of the United States, Sheng Xue of Canada, Wang Dai of Japan and Zhang Jian of France were all elected as Vice-Presidents, and Luo Le from Canada was elected as the Chair of the Supervisory Committee.
Other former Presidents of the FDC include Yan Jiaqi and Wan Runnan, who both lived in France during the FDC's initial stages and later moved to the United States. Wan Runnan currently lives in Paris.
The group had 3000 members at peak. In 2017, the membership was reduced to 100. The group split in 2017.[1]

Aleksandra Piłsudska (née Szczerbińska; 12 December 1882 – 31 March 1963) was a Polish socialist and independence activist, member of Polish Socialist Party and Polish Military Organisation, the second wife of Józef Piłsudski.


Life and career[edit]
Aleksandra was born in Suwałki, in the Suwałki Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Poland), and was the seventh child of Piotr Paweł and Julia Jadwiga (née Zahorska). Her father was a townsman, and her mother came from the nobility, but both their families were relatively poor. Aleksandra's parents died when she was ten years old, and the orphan was raised by her grandmother, Karolina Zahorska (née Truskolaska), and her aunt, Wiktoria Maria Zahorska.[1]
She attended gymnasium, the equivalent of high school, in Suwałki, graduating in 1901, and soon began her studies at the Flying University. In 1903, she began working in the office of the Homa leather factory, located in the Wola district of Warsaw.
In 1904, she joined the Polish Socialist Party (PPS), one of the two main revolutionary and political movements in partitioned Poland, the other being National Democracy. She was soon acting as a PPS agitator in the Warsaw suburb of Praga, taking part in a demonstration held on Plac Grzybowski on 13 November 1904. She also joined the military arm of the PPS, Organizacja Bojowa, where she became a courier and stockpiler of weapons. It became necessary for her to resign from her job at the factory, and she tutored students to supplement her income.
In May 1906, she met Józef Piłsudski. That year, the PPS split into two factions, supporters and opponents of Piłsudski. She remained with the Piłsudski faction. Aleksandra was arrested in 1907 and imprisoned for three weeks in Daniłłowicze prison, then transferred to the Pawiak prison, where she was eventually released due to insufficient evidence. She moved to Radzymin and later to Kiev, and at that time fell in love with Piłsudski. (He was then unhappily married to Maria Juszkiewiczowa z Koplewskich).
In 1908, she took part in the Bezdany raid, where Piłsudski and several fellow revolutionaries robbed a Russian mail train. She was crucial in helping to organize the raid, acting as a lookout, and preparing maps and plans for weeks before the robbery. Afterwards, she moved to Lwów, and once again became an office worker in a factory. Soon, she became involved with the new organization formed by Piłsudski, The Union of Riflemen, Związek Strzelecki, and from 1912, she was an important activist in the women's section of the ZS. She was a librarian in yet another one of Piłsudski's organizations, the Union of Active Fighters, Związek Walki Czynnej, and a cofounder of the  Society for the Welfare of Political Prisoners (Towarzystwo Opieki nad Więzniami Politycznymi).
During the First World War, she worked in the intelligence and communication section of the First Brigade of the Polish Legions, and soon she became involved with the Polish Military Organisation (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa). As a result of these activities, she was arrested in 1915 by the Germans in Warsaw, and again imprisoned in Pawiak in November of that year. Found guilty, she was imprisoned in Szczypiorno and Lauban in Silesia. She was released after the Act of 5 November 1916, which proclaimed the creation of the Kingdom of Poland, a puppet state, allied and expected to work with, and controlled by, the Central Powers. She then returned to Warsaw, and resumed her work in the organization called the Women's League (Liga Kobiet). She identified as a feminist and wrote:

Piłsudski already promised that if he started to organize the army he would not forget about women's unit. The feminist movement was very popular in Europe in this time. In England suffragists chained themselves to bars on the streets and torched castles while fighting for women's rights. Feminists were also popular in France and other countries. Only socialists claimed that women should have equal rights with men.[2]
In February 1918, Aleksandra had a daughter, Wanda, and in February 1920, a second daughter, Jadwiga. Their father was Józef Piłsudski. Piłsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Piłsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October of the same year.
After Piłsudski's May Coup in 1926, Aleksandra became a patron and a leader of the Women's League. She was also a chairwoman of the Military Family's Association (Rodzina Wojskowa), the "Osiedle" Association, and the Union of Polish Defenders of the Fatherland (Unia Polskich Związków Obrończyń Ojczyzny). She was also active in the affairs of the Association for the Care of Homeless Children (Towarzystwo Opieki nad Bezdomnymi Dziećmi).
Her marriage to Piłsudski became stormy in later years, with Piłsudski living apart from her for long periods of time, in various governmental residences. Josef Piłsudski died in May 1935.
After the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, she fled with her daughters via Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden to the United Kingdom. There, she wrote her memoirs, and lived in London until her death. She is buried at the North Sheen Cemetery. One of her daughters, Jadwiga, a pilot, served with distinction in the Air Transport Auxiliary during the Second World War.

The University of Birmingham Medical School is one of Britain's largest and oldest medical schools with over 400 medical, 70 pharmacy, 140 biomedical science and 130 nursing students graduating each year.[2]  It is based at the University of Birmingham in Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom. Since 2008, the medical school is a constituent of The College of Medical and Dental Sciences.


History[edit]
The roots of the Birmingham Medical School were in the medical education seminars of Mr. John Tomlinson, first surgeon to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary and later to the General Hospital. These classes were the first held in the winter of 1767–68. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical and surgical apprentices at the General Hospital, opened in 1779.[1] 
Birmingham Medical School was founded in 1825 by William Sands Cox, who began by teaching medical students in his father's house in Birmingham.[3] A new building was used from 1829 (on the site of what is now Snow Hill station). Students at this time took the licentiate/membership examinations of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries.
In 1836, Earl Howe and a number of prominent local men submitted a memorandum to King William IV, and on 22 June a reply communicated His Majesty's acquiescence to become a Patron of the School to be styled the Royal School of Medicine and Surgery in Birmingham.  There was serious need for a new teaching hospital and in 1839 Sands Cox launched an appeal. Sufficient money was raised within a year and the hospital built in 1840–41 was opened in 1841 by Sands Cox.
Queen Victoria who had granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham also allowed the new teaching hospital to be styled "The Queen’s Hospital." In 1843, the medical school became Queen's College, and students became eligible to be considered for medical degrees awarded by the University of London.[4]
A rival medical school, Syndenham College, opened in Birmingham in 1851. This merged with Queen's College in 1868 to form a new combined institution, and later merged with another institution, Mason Science College. In 1897, the Mason University College Act was passed which made Mason Science College (incorporating Queen's College) into a university college, and this, in turn became Birmingham University in 1900, and MB ChB degrees were able to be awarded by the new university.
In 1966, an outbreak of smallpox originated at University of Birmingham Medical School.[5] In 1978, Janet Parker contracted the disease while working as medical photographer in the anatomy department. She was the last known person to die of smallpox in the world.

Facilities[edit]
The Medical School is based at the University of Birmingham Edgbaston campus. The current main building was constructed in 1938 as a wing of the old Queen Elizabeth Hospital, built to consolidate the city's 18th century teaching hospitals. After most of the Queen Elizabeth's inpatient clinical space moved to the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital following its opening in 2010, the remainder of the old hospital building is now used to run specialist clinical services, research centres and administrative space. The main medical school building houses two 450-seat lecture theatres, four additional lecture theatres, numerous small group teaching rooms, laboratory space for research and teaching, a clinical skills suite, student relaxation and study space, a prosectorium for cadaveric anatomy, and the Barnes medical library. A large refurbishment and extension of the medical school building took place in 2010 to a design by Scott Wilson and constructed by Architects Design Partnership. The scheme cost £8 million and consisted of the new Leondard Deacon lecture theatre, canteen and common room facilities.
In April 2016, The new Birmingham Dental Hospital and School of Dentistry was built, opening its doors after being moved from a city centre site which was near the Children's Hospital. It houses 600 undergraduate and postgraduate dental students, trainees and academics, and is equipped to treat over 120,000 patients a year in areas including unscheduled emergency dental care, restorative dentistry, oral surgery, oral medicine, orthodontics and paediatric dentistry.
University of Birmingham students of medicine, biomedical science, pharmacy, dentistry, nursing and physiotherapy have access to special clinical resources within the Barnes Library and computer cluster within the medical school building. With the restructure of the university all these schools now come under the umbrella of the College of Medical and Dental Sciences.

Courses and admission[edit]
MB ChB Medicine and Surgery is offered as five-year, four-year or three-year course. The five-year course is by far the largest and mostly consists of undergraduate students. The first two years (termed Phase I) cover basic science and are predominantly lecture based with extensive small group tutorials. Anatomy teaching is delivered by small group seminars, prosection and digital resources. The course is integrated, and Phase I students undertake fortnightly general practice days, clinical skills and communication skills training. Years three to five consist largely of clinical placements covering all major specialties in partner NHS Trusts and GP practices located in the West Midlands.
In addition to the five-year MB ChB, a four-year graduate entry course is open to those who have already achieved a first class life sciences degree. The first year of the graduate entry course is a problem based learning design, before students join those on the five-year course for clinical study. In addition there are a small number of places on a three-year MB ChB programme designed for dental graduates wishing to train in maxillofacial surgery.
The medical school remains extremely competitive with high entry standards. Requirements for 2019 entry was A*AA at A Level.
Dentistry at Birmingham often receives many applications for each place available. With few spaces on the course, it is extremely competitive and candidates are expected to perform excellently at interview.
Pharmacy admissions accepted the first intake of students in August 2013, in the first year alone 1007 applicants applied for 70 available places. Requirements for current entry remain at AAB at A Level and A's in Maths and Science GCSEs. This course was accredited by the General Pharmaceutical Council (GPhC) in June 2017.
The BNurs Nursing degree allows students to specialise in Adult, Mental Health and Child and Public Health clinical settings. A new four-year undergraduate Masters in Nursing (MNurs)starts in September 2018 which prepares students for management roles and clinical academic careers.
The School also offers a bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science (BSc) leading to further study at postgraduate level. Medical students may also intercalate, usually after their third or forth year, on a range of specialist Bachelors or Masters-level programmes.[6]
The College of Medical and Dental Sciences also offers Dental Surgery (BDS), Dental Hygiene and Therapy (BSc) and Biomedical Materials Science (BMedSc). These courses are based at the Birmingham Dental Hospital and School of Dentistry.
The College of Health Sciences at the University of Zimbabwe was modelled after the Birmingham Medical School. The two hence share and enjoy a special relationship.

Kingmatille  is a smock mill in Dronryp, Friesland, Netherlands which was moved to its present location in 1985. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 28614.[1] The windmill is named after the nearby hamlet of Kingmatille.


History[edit]
Kingmatille was originally built in 1870 to drain the 80 hectares (200 acres) Van Duinen Polder. It was replaced by a diesel engine. The mill was restored in 1950 and in 1985 it was moved to its present location,[2] by the Hatzumer Polder.[3] The mill was officially opened on 23 October 1991 by Pieter van Vollenhoven.[2] In May 1987, the Archimedes' screw broke. It was repaired by spring 2009.[4]

Description[edit]
For an explanation of the various items of machinery, see Mill machinery.
Kingmatille is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sail reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of 13.00 metres (42 ft 8 in). The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 38 cogs. This drives the wallower (20 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 29 cogs drives a gearwheel with 30 cogs on the axle of the wooden Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is 280 millimetres (11 in) diameter and the screw is 900 millimetres (2 ft 11 in) diameter and 4.15 metres (13 ft 7 in) long. The screw is inclined at 22°. Each revolution of the screw lifts 193 litres (42 imp gal) of water.[2]

Public access[edit]
Kingmatille is open to the public by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays.[5]

Paper Dolls is an American primetime television soap opera that aired for 14 episodes on ABC from September 23 to December 25, 1984. Set in New York's fashion industry, the show centered on top modeling agency owner Racine (Morgan Fairchild), her conflicts with the family of cosmetics tycoon Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), and the careers of two teenaged models (Terry Farrell and Nicollette Sheridan). The series was based on a 1982 television film of the same name. The show suffered in the ratings, despite positive reviews, and was cancelled midway through the first season.[1]


Overview[edit]
1982 television film[edit]
Paper Dolls first aired on May 24, 1982 as an ABC Monday Night Movie, which revolved around the lives of two teenage models, Taryn and Laurie, and their strong-willed mothers. The cast included Joan Hackett as Julia Blake, Jennifer Warren as Dinah Caswell, Daryl Hannah as Julia's daughter Taryn, Marc Singer as Wesley Myles, Antonio Fargas as photographer Oliver, Barry Primus as Alan (credited as "also starring"), Alexandra Paul as Dinah's daughter Laurie (in her first role, credited as "introducing") and Craig T. Nelson as husband Michael. Joan Collins appeared as Racine, the conniving owner of Taryn and Laurie's modelling agency, credited in the opening as a "special guest star". Eric Stoltz, William Brian Curran, Jeffrey Richman and Lillibet Stern appeared in co-starring roles. The film was directed by Edward Zwick and written by Casey T. Mitchell and Leah Markus, with a theme song written by Mark Snow and performed by Brock Walsh. It garnered 20.5 million viewers.

1984 television series[edit]
Clockwise from top: Terry Farrell, Morgan Fairchild, and Nicollette Sheridan
In 1984, MGM decided to produce a weekly series based on the original film. Jennifer Warren and Jeffrey Richman (in the minor role of Conrad) were the only actors to reprise their roles, with Hackett (who died unexpectedly before production), Hannah, Paul, Nelson and Collins replaced by Brenda Vaccaro, Nicollette Sheridan, Terry Farrell, John Bennett Perry and Morgan Fairchild respectively.
New characters included Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), the manipulative chairman of the conglomerate Harper World Wide,[2] who was frequently at odds with Racine (Fairchild); his second wife Marjorie (Nancy Olson); his son Wesley (Dack Rambo), chief executive of Harper Cosmetics, who allied with Racine against his father, blaming him for the accidental death of his mother, Virginia, Grant's first wife; his daughter, Blair Harper Fenton (Mimi Rogers), Racine's top model; and Blair's husband David Fenton (Richard Beymer), head of Tempus Sportswear, a business rival to Grant.
During the series, Blair is 30 years old, pregnant and fearing the end of her modelling career. Despite health problems, she was determined to carry her baby to full term. David is too proud to accept financial assistance, and resorts to accepting money from loan sharks to fund his upcoming collection, putting him and Blair in danger. Eventually, he is forced to ask his father in-law for help, resulting in Tempus being brought under the Harper World Wide banner, paying off the loan in full, and also the interest.
Meanwhile, Racine struggles to manage Taryn Blake (Sheridan), the top teen model in the business, who has problems with drugs and alcohol, and a sensationalized romance with 1980s pop star John Waite (playing himself in a recurring role). To keep Taryn and her demanding mother Julia (Vaccaro) in line, Racine decides to promote a new fresh teen face, a young woman named Laurie Caswell (Farrell). The naive and innocent Laurie still attends public school in Stonehurst in Long Island and is not prepared for the fast life, despite her mother Dinah Anderson Caswell's (Warren) best efforts to keep her grounded. Dinah, a former model herself, focuses too much time on her daughter's career, putting a strain on her marriage to Michael Caswell (Perry), Laurie's stepfather.
Despite their vast differences, Taryn and Laurie become good friends, while the rivalry between their two mothers, Julia and Dinah, intensifies. The vindictive and mean-spirited Julia sees her daughter as a meal ticket, and dreads the day Taryn that turns 17 and becomes more financially independent. Rounding out the cast is Blair's friend Sara Frank (Anne Schedeen), a sensible lawyer, who is involved with Mark Bailey (Roscoe Born in a recurring role), a reporter doing a story on the fashion industry. Mark becomes enamored with Racine, much to the horror of Sara, who despite agreeing that she's "done well for a girl named off of a map of Wisconsin", warns that Racine has "been in more beds than a hotel breakfast tray!"

Syndication and international broadcast[edit]
Reruns of the series have been shown on the SOAPnet cable channel in the United States. The series was also shown in the United Kingdom by the ITV network in the mid-1980s, though schedules varied per region. It was also shown in Italy on Canale 5 under the name Il profumo del successo (The Taste of Success), and in Germany under the title Karussell der Puppen (Doll Carousel). In South America and Spain, it was broadcast as Muñecas de Papel. In Sweden, it was broadcast 1986 on TV2 under the name Modedockorna (The Fashion Dolls).

Reception[edit]
The series attempted to ride the wave of popular glossy nighttime soaps, such as Dallas and Dynasty. When Paper Dolls premiered in September 1984, the first episode achieved an 18.4 rating, and featured the requisite stock pleasures of the genre, such as big business, glamour, intrigue, catfights and verbal spats (particularly between Racine and the other cast members). In one scene, Mark enters Racine's office while she is getting a massage, asking "Do you want me to wait outside until you're decent?" Racine responds "How much time do you have?" In another scene, an irate Julia, brandishing a Barbie-style fashion doll of her daughter, storms into Racine's office. "This will not be the new Taryn Blake doll!" she barks. "The eyes are brown!" Coolly, Racine quips, "I guess they couldn't quite match that bloodshot tone."
Even with a series of rave reviews in People  urging viewers to give the show a chance,[4] ratings were low and the series was not able to find an audience, due in large part because it had been pre-empted on some weeks by the baseball playoffs. The final episode of the series found David on the verge of failure after an influential fashion critic is blackmailed by Wesley and Racine to pan his new sportswear collection; Marjorie is feared dead in a plane crash; and Racine receives a call from Mark intimating that his digging into her secretive past and had uncovered something very interesting. The cliffhangers were left unresolved.

The Luxembourg Tennis Federation (French: Fédération Luxembourgeoise de Tennis) is the tennis governing body in Luxembourg and responsible for the development of the game in the country.

Tennis in Luxembourg[edit]
Tennis is a popular sport, as it is across western Europe.  There are 53 tennis clubs in the country, the oldest of which (TC Diekirch) was founded in 1902.  The governing body is the Luxembourg Tennis Federation.  The Luxembourg Open was held in Luxembourg (Kockelscheuer) until 2021, and was ranked as a WTA International tournament on the WTA Tour.
Luxembourgers have had little success in professional tennis.  Gilles Müller, considered the best men's player the country has ever produced,[3] reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 U.S. Open and the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, has two ATP Titles and has a career high ranking of 21st.  Women's players that have reached the top fifty include Anne Kremer (18th), Karin Kschwendt (37th) and Claudine Schaul (41st).

General informationTypeStreetLocationBrisbane
George Street is a major street located in the Brisbane CBD in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.


Geography[edit]
George Street extends from the Queensland University of Technology's Garden Point campus and City Botanic Gardens at its south-east end (27°28′32″S 153°01′41″E﻿ / ﻿27.4756°S 153.0281°E﻿ / -27.4756; 153.0281﻿ (George Street (south-east end))), through the commercial centre of Brisbane (Queen Street and Queen Street Mall), through to Roma Street railway station at its north-west end (27°28′00″S 153°01′11″E﻿ / ﻿27.4667°S 153.0196°E﻿ / -27.4667; 153.0196﻿ (George Street (north-west end))).[1]
The State Parliament House building for the state of Queensland and Brisbane Square, as well as the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law and the State Law Building are found on the street. Queens Gardens, Treasury Building, Lands Administration Building and The Mansions are all located on George Street. Other office towers built on George Street include 111 George Street, 275 George Street and 400 George Street. At the northern end is the Roma Street railway station.

History[edit]
George Street in 1889George Street as well as Queen Street, Wickham Street and the area known as Petrie Bight were unsealed and often dusty before 1899.[2] In 1897, the North Brisbane Council held an election on whether a loan should be raised so the streets could be woodblocked. Agreement was given after a close decision by only a third of registered voters, however the results were limited as the surface was very slippery during the rain and buckled during heavy rains.[2]
The first private residence in Brisbane, a weatherboard, low-ceilinged cottage, was built on George Street.[3] The building remained intact into the 1880s but like similar early houses in the central business district they have been demolished and the land redeveloped.[3]

View along George Street, Brisbane towards the Brisbane Technical College, with the Menzies Hotel on the left and The Mansions on the right, circa 1919
In 1867, the Menzies Private Hotel was established at 28 George Street (corner of Margaret Street and adjacent to the Queensland Club).[4] It was refurbished and re-opened as the Kingsley Private Hotel in July 1922.[5] It has since been demolished.Bellevue Hotel, 1933
The Bellevue Hotel opened on the western corner of George and Alice Streets c. 1885. It served for many years as Brisbane's premier hotel. Without any prior public announcement, the Queensland Government demolished the building overnight on 20 April 1979.[6]
In 1911, Queensland belatedly established its first university, the University of Queensland, in the Old Government House at the end of George Street.[7] By the late 1930s,  the university outgrew this site, moving its main campus to St Lucia after World War II.[8]

Damage following gas explosion, George Street, Brisbane, July 1970
On Friday 17 July 1970, a faulty fuse in a traffic light created a spark that ignited a leaking gas pipe running through the basements of several George Street buildings (between Queen Street and Adelaide Street) which caused a series of explosions, killing one woman and injuring 38 other people. The damage to buildings in George Street and neighbouring streets as well as roads and other infrastructure was estimated at $500,000.[9][10][11][12]

Carpathia Seamount, also known as Carpathia Knoll, is an undersea mountain in the North Atlantic Ocean, located about 600 km (370 mi) southeast of Cape Race in Canadian waters off Atlantic Canada. It rises to a height of over 1,000 m (3,300 ft) and has an areal extent of 550 km2 (210 sq mi), making it slightly larger than the Ontarian city of Kingston. Carpathia Seamount and Mount Temple Seamount about 90 km (56 mi) to the west are among the closest seamounts to the RMS Titanic wreck.[1]
Carpathia Seamount is one of the seven named Fogo Seamounts. Its name is derived from the British steamship RMS Carpathia, which was the first on the scene after the RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg. The Carpathia rescued passengers of the Titanic following her sinking.[1]

For the first time, the band recorded live outside in wilderness located in upstate New York. The recording process for Amen & Goodbye took four years — longer than for any of the band's previous albums — which was exacerbated by damage to their tapes caused by a rainstorm.[2]

Artwork[edit]
The cover art was created by sculptor David Altmejd, and was described by the band as, "Sgt Pepper meets Hieronymous Bosch meets Dalí meets PeeWee's Playhouse."[3]

Critical reception[edit]
The album was described by Transverso Media as, "Yeasayer’s most heterogeneous body of work, both in terms of the patchwork of its sonic and textural peaks and valleys but also its blending of classic motifs with newly formed bizzarities in a way that never feels heavy handed or campy," stating, "they don’t just reconcile the worldbeat freak rock of All Hour Cymbals, psychedelic pop of Odd Blood, and brooding, dark electronica of Fragrant World, but manage to transcend time and space itself with a mélange of biblical allusions, futuristic sound, and countless other seemingly disparate stylistic and thematic juxtapositions."[2]

José Orlando Henao Montoya (5 May 1953 – 13 November 1998), also known by the nicknames 'Don H' and El Hombre del Overol (English: The Overall Man), was a Colombian drug lord who was one of the leaders of the notorious Norte del Valle Cartel along with his brothers and associates like Iván Urdinola Grajales . During his career he was considered an extremely cunning criminal and in the words of his former associates the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers "More bloodthirsty than Pablo Escobar".[1][2][3]


Early years[edit]
He was older brother of Arcángel, Ancizar, Fernando, Óscar Iván and Lorena Henao Montoya. He was a policeman and went on to work in the Cali Cartel's cocaine laboratories, colloquially called "kitchens", giving him his characteristic nickname. He would later become head of the labs, rising through the ranks to become a mid-level commander in the cartel.

Rise of Norte del Valle Cartel[edit]
After the defeat of Pablo Escobar and the end of the Medellín Cartel, the Prosecutor General's Office, after a series of negotiations, proposed to the Cali Cartel a surrender that would include house arrest for its members, without expropriation of their money and possessions, in exchange for putting an end to drug trafficking. A meeting of the entire Cali Cartel was arranged to discuss this proposal, but the mid-level commanders, led by Henao, refused for various reasons, causing the Cali Cartel to split, giving rise to the Norte del Valle Cartel.[4]
His area of influence extended to the Cali metropolitan area and he was mainly investigated for transporting drugs from a laboratory owned by a man known in the drug trafficking world as "Bazuco" to the port of Buenaventura.
He did this with the active collaboration of retired Armed Forces officers, well equipped with high calibre weapons, means of communication and all-terrain vehicles.[5] He was also investigated for illicit enrichment. Despite evidence of illicit enrichment, Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff refused to open an investigation against Henao.
After the capture of his former associates in the Cali Cartel, Henao gained power by bribing authorities, especially police Colonel Danilo González, and by allying himself with the paramilitaries led by Carlos Castaño Gil.[6][7]
Henao, together with Colonel González and Castaño, instigated the assassination of Chepe Santacruz, who had escaped from prison, and other Cartel figures such as the hitman Nicol Parra,[8][9] and William Rodríguez Abadía, who escaped unharmed. Subsequently and surprisingly, Henao met with the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers in prison and signed the peace agreement, convinced by his partner and friend Andrés López López.
Henao, fearing that he would be betrayed by his own associates to the DEA, took advantage of the mistreatment of Fernando Cifuentes by his boss Efraín Hernández "Don Efra", and on 6 November 1996, Cifuentes killed Hernández on Henao's orders and then Cifuentes was killed by Wilber Varela, the main hitman on Henao's orders.[10]

Surrender and death[edit]
After negotiating with his associates Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía "Chupeta", Victor Patiño-Fomeque "El Químico" and Juan Carlos Ortiz Escobar "Cuchilla", surrendered after them to the justice system, taking advantage of his influence in the government, and would serve only 3 years in prison.[11][12] However, Pacho Herrera and Miguel Rodríguez, taking advantage of Henao's surrender, order an attack on Varela, who is wounded in the attack and discovers that Herrera is behind the attack. Varela, recovered, asks Henao for authorisation to kill Herrera, which Henao initially refuses, determined to maintain the peace agreed with the Rodríguez brothers and doubting that Herrera is behind the attack. But Henao soon discovers that Herrera is negotiating with the DEA to hand over the heads of the Norte del Valle Cartel and Henao authorises Varela to kill Herrera.[13][14]
José Manuel Herrera Moncada "El inválido" (The crippled), half-brother of 'Pacho Herrera' and who was in the same prison yard with Henao, senses that Henao and Varela are behind his brother's death and decides to take revenge; he secretly brings in two weapons. Although Henao denies that he was responsible for the murder and offers him his friendship as well as killing Varela if he confirms that he was responsible for Herrera's death, Henao is finally killed on 13 November 1998 by "El inválido".[15][16]

Consequences[edit]
Henao's murder marked the fragmentation of the Norte del Valle Cartel into two irreconcilable and rival factions; the Machos led by his cousin Diego Montoya "Don Diego", and the Rastrojos led by Wilber Varela, in addition to the violent Varela's reaction ordering the murder of the clan of the Herrera brothers, among them "El inválido" in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and the exile of others of them.[17][18]

In popular culture[edit]
In 2008 Caracol TV produced the TV Series El cartel, where Henao is portrayed by the colombian actor Fernando Solórzano as the character of Óscar Cadena. Solórzano reprises his role in film version The Snitch Cartel and El Señor de los Cielos (season 1).
In Netflix series Narcos, Henao is portrayed by the colombian actor Julian Arango, who portrayed before Álvaro José Pérez 'Guadaña' in El Cartel.

Mothers (Macedonian: Мајки / Majki) is a 2010 film by Milcho Manchevski. An international co-production, the film mingles fiction with documentary.


Premise[edit]
Three stories, all true, one real.[1]  Employing an innovative structure, the three stories in Mothers highlight the delicate relationship of truth and fiction, of drama and documentary. What is the nature of truth? The film eschews neat narrative devices and pushes to confront their own definitions of filmic reality.
The three stories[2] focus on three aspects of life in contemporary North Macedonia (a city, a small town and a deserted village).  Mothers, whose motto is “The Truth Hurts” explores the nature of truth – all three stories (two fiction and one documentary) are based on real events, but only one - the most incredible - is told as  documentary. This story examines the unsolved mystery of the Kichevo serial killer who murdered several retired cleaning women. A crime reporter who covered the stories was arrested, and two days later he was found dead with his head in a bucket of water. A suicide note was found in his cell.

Principal photography took place in three areas in North Macedonia: Mariovo, Kicevo and Skopje, North Macedonia.[citation needed]

Release[edit]
Mothers[5] premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and had its European premiere in the Panorama section of the 61st Berlin International Film Festival.[citation needed]

Reception[edit]
Critical reception[edit]
Natasha Senjanovic of The Hollywood Reporter said "Manchevski mixes fiction with documentary in a film that hits home on an emotional rather than intellectual level".[6]
Diego Pierini writing in LoudVision said Mothers is a very strange film, sometimes sophisticated, poignant and often elliptical.[...] One of the most interesting and original filmmakers of recent years [...] One of those authors who are not afraid to face the genres and to push the boundaries.[7]

Personal detailsBorn(1903-10-18)October 18, 1903Dún Laoghaire, IrelandDiedMay 15, 1988(1988-05-15) (aged 84)Clearwater, Florida, U.S.Political partyRepublicanEducationSt. Lawrence University (BA)Brooklyn Law School (LLB)*Vandenberg was on leave for the full duration of his term, and Stephens served as acting appointments secretary. Shanley acted as White House counsel in Stephens's stead.
Thomas Edwin Stephens (October 18, 1903 – May 15, 1988) served in the Eisenhower White House and worked on various Republican political campaigns.
Stephens was born in County Dublin, Ireland, and came with his family to the United States at the age of 13.[1] He graduated from St. Lawrence University in 1932 and earned a law degree at Brooklyn Law School.
He began his political career in New York City. In 1934 he became an Assistant Corporation Counsel,[2] representing the city's interests at the state legislature in Albany.[3] In 1936 he entered private practice with the firm of Lord, Day and Lord.[3] In 1938 he became administrative assistant to Newbold Morris, President of the City Council.[2]
In World War II he served in Europe as a major in the Army Air Corps.
Following the war he became active in national Republican politics. In 1944 he worked as an assistant to Herbert Brownell, manager of Governor Dewey's campaign for the presidency.[2] In 1945 and 1946 he served as director of the Republican National Committee's campaign division.[3] He also served as administrative assistant to Senator John Foster Dulles in 1949.[2][3] In 1950, he became the secretary to the New York Republican State Committee, serving until 1952.[2]
He worked on Dewey's successful campaign for the Republican nomination in 1948 and his failed bid for the presidency that year. He 1952 he helped to organize the effort to draft General Eisenhower to run for office, then worked on Eisenhower's successful primary campaigns and was an aide to the General during the election campaign.[3]
He left the New York law firm of Pheiffer, Stephens, and Weaver[1] to join the White House staff as Appointments Secretary in January 1953. He had been recommended for the position by Sherman Adams.[3] Despite his administrative title, he acted as a political adviser as well, was highly valued by the President and more influential than many realized.[4]
He served until February 19, 1955, when he resigned to return to the "less ulcerous" duties of private law practice, joining the New York law firm of Shearman and Sterling and Wright. Press reports said he was "expected to remain a personal lieutenant of the President outside the White House. His soundings of opinion among politicians and the public may be highly persuasive if President Eisenhower considers running for a second term in 1956.[1]
He worked on Eisenhower's 1956 re-election campaign[4] and later returned to his position as Appointments Secretary in March 1958.[4]
On January 25, 1961, just days after the end of Eisenhower's presidency, Stephens married Mary Caffrey, secretary to James Hagerty, who had been Eisenhower's press secretary. The couple lived in Phoenix.[5] Stephens said he planned to enter business.[4]
In 1962 he re-entered politics to work on Nelson Rockefeller's campaign for re-election as Governor of New York.[4] In 1964, he served Rockefeller's presidential campaign as campaign director for the Eastern and Middle Atlantic states.[6] He worked that same year on Senator Kenneth Keating's failed attempt to win re-election to the U.S. Senate.[4] In 1968 he worked for Rockefeller's presidential campaign and on Senator Jacob Javits' successful re-election campaign as well.[4]
He died in Clearwater, Florida, on May 15, 1988.[4]

The Electoral district No. 10 (Kazakh: №10 сайлау округі, romanized: №10 sailau okrugı; Russian: Избирательный округ №10) is a single-mandate territorial constituency in Kazakhstan, represented in the lower chamber Mäjilis of the Parliament. It covers the entirety of Aktobe Region, including all its regional districts, with its seat being centered in Aktobe.
The constituency was originally formed for the 2004 legislative election and existed until being abolished in 2007. However, it has been reestablished in 2022 and is currently represented by deputy Qazybek Älişev (Amanat) since March 2023.[3]


Geography[edit]
The Electoral district No. 10 is situated in the territory of Aktobe Region, and its administrative center, Aktobe, serves as the seat of the constituency. It shares borders with No. 14 (West Kazakhstan Region), No. 13 (Atyrau Region), and No. 22 (Mangystau Region) to the west, No. 21 (Kyzylorda Region) to the south, along with No. 28 (Ulytau Region) and No. 20 (Kostanay Region) to the east.[4]

History[edit]
The Electoral district No. 10 was formed for the 2004 legislative election as a result of redistribution originally within the boundaries of Akmola Region, and Zäure Qadyrova served as deputy from the constituency.[5] From there, the electoral district continued to exist until its dissolution following the 2007 constitutional amendment, which led to the abolition of all constituencies as part of the transition from a mixed-member majoritarian representation to a fully party-list proportional representation system.[6][7][8] The change affected the composition of all seats in the lower chamber Mäjilis of the Kazakh Parliament beginning with the 2007 legislative election.[9][10]
On 24 December 2022, the Electoral district No. 10 was reestablished by the Central Election Commission in the Aktobe Region, which came into effect on 1 January 2023 as a result of the 2022 amendment.[11][12] The adoption of this amendment marked the reintroduction of a mixed electoral system for electing Mäjilis deputies, with the use of numbered constituencies being reinstated for the first time since 2004.[13][14] It made its debut in the 2023 legislative election, with Qazybek Älişev becoming the elected representative of the constituency.[15]

The National Football League playoffs for the 2018 season began with the Wildcard Round on January 5, 2019, and concluded with Super Bowl LIII at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 3, 2019, when the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3.
For the first time in NFL history, both conference championship games went to overtime.
The Patriots became the first team since the Buffalo Bills in 1990–1993 to reach at least three consecutive Super Bowls, and the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to win the Super Bowl after losing it the previous year.


Participants[edit]
Within each conference, the four division winners and the top two non-division winners with the best overall regular season records) qualified for the playoffs. The four division winners are seeded 1–4 based on their overall won-lost-tied record, and the wild card teams are seeded 5–6. The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system, and there are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. In the first round, dubbed the wild-card playoffs or wild-card weekend, the third-seeded division winner hosts the sixth-seed wild card, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth. The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference received a first-round bye. In the second round, the divisional playoffs, the number 1 seed hosts the worst-surviving seed from the first round (seed 4, 5, or 6), while the number 2 seed will play the other team (seed 3, 4, or 5). The two surviving teams from each conference's divisional playoff games met in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championship games, hosted by the higher seed. Although the Super Bowl, the championship round of the playoffs, is played at a neutral site, the designated home team is based on an annual rotation by conference.[1]

Indianapolis, who had started the year 1–5 and still managed to make the playoffs, buried the Texans with 276 yards and 21 points in the first half.
On the opening drive of the game, Colts quarterback Andrew Luck completed three passes to T. Y. Hilton for 63 yards before finishing the drive with a 5-yard scoring completion to Eric Ebron. Then after a punt, Indianapolis drove 75 yards in 9 plays to go up 14–0. The key player on the drive was running back Marlon Mack, who carried the ball 6 times for 39 yards, caught a 6-yard pass and finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. Houston then drove to the Colts' 45-yard line; but while trying to convert a 4th-and-4, Deshaun Watson's pass was intercepted by Kenny Moore II, who returned it from 10 yards to midfield. Indianapolis then advanced the ball to the Texans' 17-yard line, but they also failed to score when Luck's pass was deflected by J. J. Watt and then intercepted by lineman Brandon Dunn on the last play of the first quarter.
Houston had to punt after three plays and the Colts went on to drive to a 21–0 lead by moving the ball 65 yards in 7 plays, featuring two key receptions by receiver Dontrelle Inman. The first was for 21 yards and the second was an 18-yard touchdown catch. Houston responded with their most promising drive of the game, advancing the ball 69 yards to the Colts' 9-yard line. However, on a 4th-and-1 conversion attempt, Watson threw an incomplete pass with 1:24 left in the half.
Both defenses controlled the third quarter as the first six drives of it ended in punts. With just over 2 minutes left in the period, the Texans fired up a 16-play, 89-yard drive. Watson rushed for 10 yards, while also completing 9-of-11 passes for 66 yards, the last a 6-yard touchdown pass to Keke Coutee that made the score 21–7 with 11:04 remaining. Following a Colts punt, the Texans drove to a 3rd-and-10 on the Indianapolis 24-yard line. Watson's next two passes were incomplete, causing a turnover on downs with 4:17 remaining. The Colts then managed to run out the rest of the time, mainly due to plays from Mack, who picked up first downs with runs of 2, 15 and 26 yards.
Luck completed 19-of-32 passes for 222 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, and rushed for 29 yards. Hilton was his top receiver with five receptions for 85 yards. Mack carried the ball 24 times for a franchise postseason record 148 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for six yards. Prior to this game, the Texans had not allowed a 100-yard rusher all season. Moore had 6 tackles (5 solo), a sack and an interception. Watson completed 29-of-49 passes for 235 yards, with one touchdown and one interception; he was also Houston's leading rusher with eight carries for 76 yards. Coutee caught 11 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown.[3]

Dallas outgained Seattle in total yards 380–299 and limited the Seahawks, the #1 rushing offense during the regular season, to just 73 yards on the ground.[4]
Dallas scored on their opening drive, advancing the ball 54 yards in 10 plays on the way to a 39-yard field goal by Brett Maher. This would be the only score of the first quarter, as the next six drives ended in punts. In the second quarter, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson's completions to Ed Dickson and Tyler Lockett for gains of 26 and 40 yards set up Sebastian Janikowski's 27-yard field goal. Dallas responded with a drive to the Seattle 40-yard line, but it ended there as Maher missed a 58-yard field goal attempt. Seattle took over on their own 48-yard line; Wilson's 25-yard pass to Lockett on the ensuing drive set up another Janikowski field goal to give Seattle a 6–3 lead. A few plays into the Cowboys' next possession, they faced 3rd-and-1 with 1:11 left in the half. Ezekiel Elliott took a handoff, ran to the right and raced down the sideline for a 44-yard gain to the Seahawks' 22-yard line. Four plays later, Dak Prescott finished the 75-yard drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to rookie receiver Michael Gallup with 28 seconds left, giving Dallas a 10–6 lead. Lockett gave Seattle a chance to score by returning the ensuing kickoff 52 yards to the Cowboys' 49-yard line; Seattle could only advance to the 39-yard line from there and ended the half with Janikowski's missed field goal attempt from 60 yards. Janikowski injured his leg on the kick and had to miss the rest of the game, turning the kicking duties over to rookie punter Michael Dickson.[5]
With 8:04 left in the third quarter, Seahawks defensive back Neiko Thorpe managed to knock Michael Dickson's 45-yard punt away from the end zone, where it was downed by Seattle on the Cowboys' 2-yard line. Dallas failed to gain any yards over their next three plays and Chris Jones' 42-yard punt gave the ball back to Seattle on the Dallas 44-yard line. Faced with 4th down and 4 after three plays, Seattle decided to go for the first down, a gamble that paid off as Wilson threw a pass to Doug Baldwin, who barely managed to keep his feet in bounds while hauling in the ball at the left sideline for a 22-yard gain. Then when faced with 3rd-and-5, Wilson managed to pick up the first down himself on a 7-yard run. Finally with just over 2 minutes left in the quarter, Wilson finished the 9-play, 44-yard drive with a 4-yard touchdown run; Mike Davis ran for a successful two-point conversion, giving the Seahawks a 14–10 lead. Michael Dickson drop-kicked the ensuing kickoff, which went to running back Rod Smith at the 20-yard line, where he returned it 15 yards. Four plays later, Prescott completed a 34-yard pass to Amari Cooper at the Seattle 16-yard line, setting up Elliott's 1-yard touchdown run that gave the Dallas a 17–14 lead with just over 12 minutes left. After three plays, Tavon Austin returned Michael Dickson's 60-yard punt 51 yards to the Seattle 38-yard line. Dallas was now in prime position to take a late-game two-score lead, but after driving to the 16-yard line, Prescott threw a pass to Noah Brown that bounced off his shoulder and was intercepted in the end zone by K. J. Wright as he fell to the ground. Still, Dallas' defense rose to the occasion and forced a punt, which Cole Beasley returned 7 yards to the Dallas 37-yard line. The Cowboys went on to drive 54 yards in 11 plays, aided by three Seattle penalties, including two pass interference calls on third down plays. Elliott also made a big impact with a 17-yard run, while Prescott converted a 3rd-and-14 with a 16-yard run before taking the ball into the end zone himself on a 1-yard score. This gave Dallas a 24–14 lead with 2:14 left.
On the second play after the kickoff, Wilson's 53-yard completion to Lockett gave Seattle a first down on the Dallas 13-yard line. Wilson followed this up with two completions to backup running back J. D. McKissic, the first for 6 yards and the second a 7-yard touchdown pass. Chris Carson then scored on a two-point conversion run, cutting the score to 24–22 with 1:16 left. However, Michael Dickson's ensuing drop kick went right into the hands of Beasley, enabling Dallas to run out the rest of the game and secure their first playoff win since the 2014 playoffs.
Prescott finished the game 22-of-33 for 226 yards and a touchdown, with one interception. He also rushed for 29 yards and a touchdown. His top receiver was Cooper, who caught seven passes for 106 yards. Elliott had 26 carries for 137 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 32 yards. For Seattle, Wilson completed 18-of-27 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, while also running for 14 yards and a score. Lockett caught four passes for 120 yards, returned a kickoff for 52 yards and gained 22 yards on three punt returns. Michael Dickson averaged 51.4 yards per punt on his seven punts and put one of them in the 20.

The Chargers recorded six sacks, jumped out to a 23–3 lead and halted a late Ravens rally, forcing Lamar Jackson to fumble on the final drive to earn a trip to New England.
On the Ravens' second possession of the game, Chargers defensive end Melvin Ingram forced a fumble from Kenneth Dixon that was recovered by safety Adrian Phillips, giving Los Angeles the ball on the Baltimore 14-yard line. Three plays later, Michael Badgley kicked a 21-yard field goal to give Los Angeles a 3–0 lead. Then the Chargers' defense forced a punt, which Desmond King returned 42 yards to the Ravens' 42-yard line, setting up a 53-yard Badgley field goal that increased their lead to 6–0. Early in the second quarter, Phillips intercepted a pass from Jackson to give the Chargers a first down on the Ravens' 44-yard line. From there, they drove 27 yards to go up 9–0 on Badgley's third field goal. Following another Ravens punt, Los Angeles drove 53 yards in 12 plays to score on Badgley's fourth field goal on the last play of the half, giving them a 12–0 lead.
King returned the second half kickoff 72 yards to the Ravens' 35-yard line, but this time the Chargers failed to score when Badgley's field goal attempt was blocked by Za'Darius Smith. After a Ravens punt, linebacker Patrick Onwuasor forced a fumble from Chargers tight end Virgil Green that was recovered by linebacker C. J. Mosley on the Los Angeles 21-yard line. This set up Justin Tucker's 33-yard field goal, cutting the score to 12–3 with 8:34 left in the third quarter. At the end of Los Angeles' next possession, the Ravens got another scoring opportunity when Javorius Allen blocked Donnie Jones's punt, resulting in Baltimore taking over on the Chargers' 40-yard line; they only managed to gain 4 yards with their next three plays and Tucker's 50-yard field goal attempt was wide right. Los Angeles then drove 60 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 28-yard completion from Philip Rivers to Mike Williams on the Ravens' 15-yard line. On the next play, Melvin Gordon ran the ball 14 yards to the 1-yard line. The Ravens managed to keep Los Angeles out of the end zone for the next three plays, but Gordon scored with a 4th down 1-yard touchdown run on the first play of the 4th quarter; Rivers completed a pass to Williams for a two-point conversion, giving the Chargers a 20–3 lead.
A sack by Ingram on the Ravens' ensuing drive forced them to punt from their 14-yard line and Sam Koch's 31-yard kick gave the Chargers good field position on the Ravens' 45-yard line. Los Angeles then drove 16 yards, including a 9-yard scramble by Rivers on 3rd-and-8, to score on Badgley's 5th field goal, from 47 yards, that gave them a 23–3 lead. Taking the ball back with 9:02 left, Baltimore drove 75 yards in eight plays, including Jackson's 29-yard completion to Willie Snead on 4th-and-11. On the next play, Jackson threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to receiver Michael Crabtree, making the score 23–10. The Chargers recovered Baltimore's ensuing onside kick attempt, but still had to punt after three plays. Baltimore went on to drive 85 yards in 12 plays, the longest a 39-yard completion from Jackson to Dixon. On the last play, Jackson threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to Crabtree, narrowing their gap to 23–17 with 2:06 left. Baltimore then forced a punt with 45 seconds to go, giving them one last chance to drive for a winning touchdown, but Chargers linebacker Uchenna Nwosu forced a fumble while sacking Jackson and Ingram recovered it to give Los Angeles the victory.
Rivers completed 22-of-32 passes for 160 yards and rushed for 15 yards. Ingram finished the game with seven tackles (two for a loss of yards), two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.

Nick Foles threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Golden Tate with 56 seconds remaining and then defensive tackle Treyvon Hester blocked a 43-yard Cody Parkey game-winning field goal attempt with five seconds remaining to seal it for the Eagles.[6]
Both offenses had a slow start of the game. Philadelphia quarterback Nick Foles completed 4/6 passes for 57 yards on the opening drive, setting up Jake Elliott's 43-yard field goal to take a 3–0 lead. The next three drives ended in a punt, two of which were three-and-outs. Foles was picked off by Roquan Smith at the beginning of the second quarter when the Eagles were 10 yards into Chicago territory. Smith returned it into the end zone for what would have been a Bears touchdown, but he was ruled down by contact at Chicago's 35-yard line. The interception started a 47-yard drive in which Mitchell Trubisky completed 3 passes for 28 yards and rushed for 6. The possession ended in a Cody Parkey 36-yard field goal to tie the game at 3–3. Philadelphia went deep into the Bears' territory in their next possession, but a Foles pass intended for Nelson Agholor was intercepted by Adrian Amos inside the end zone. After another three-and-out by each team, Chicago set up the final drive of the quarter, starting from their own 11-yard line. Trubisky completed 6/8 passes for 59 yards, the longest a 23-yard catch by Anthony Miller, as the team drove 78 yards to go up 6–3 on Parkey's 29-yard field goal as time expired in the half.
The Eagles scored the first touchdown of the game in the third quarter to regain the lead. At the start of the drive, a late hit by Amos on Zach Ertz caused an unnecessary roughness penalty called against the Bears, on what would have been a three-and-out. Another penalty against the Chicago defense for pass interference on Prince Amukamara resulted in a 33-yard gain that gave the Eagles 1st-and-goal. Foles capitalized with a 10-yard touchdown pass to the rookie tight end Dallas Goedert, giving the Eagles a 10–6 lead. The Bears' offense responded with a 62-yard drive, including a 45-yard completion from Trubisky to Allen Robinson, that ended in another field goal by Parkey from 34 yards at the beginning of the fourth quarter to cut the Eagles' lead to one at 10–9. The next Bears drive saw some Trubisky crucial throws, including a 19-yard pass to Taylor Gabriel on 3rd-and-11 and a 34-yard pass to Josh Bellamy. A 22-yard pass to Robinson for the touchdown culminated the possession and put Chicago ahead of Philadelphia once again, although their two-point attempt was unsuccessful, making he score 15–10. The Eagles, trailing by five, started what would be the winning drive on their own 40-yard line after a bad punt by the Bears. The Bears were able to stop three downs starting at their 2-yard line, but Philadelphia finally scored on 4th down with Foles' 2-yard touchdown pass to Golden Tate to take a one-point lead with less than one minute remaining. The Eagles went for the two-point conversion, but a rush by Wendell Smallwood was ruled to be short of the end zone. The play was reviewed, but video evidence was not clear enough to overturn the ruling on the field.[7]
Chicago started their final drive of the game with 0:56 left. Tarik Cohen returned the kickoff 35 yards to the Bears' 42-yard line and a 25-yard pass from Trubisky to Robinson settled the home team into field goal position. The Eagles called a timeout before the snap to negate the first field goal try. After that, Parkey's 43-yard kick was tipped by the Eagles' defensive tackle Treyvon Hester, hit the left goal post and bounced off the crossbar to send Philadelphia to the divisional round. Parkey later reacted, "I feel terrible. There's really no answer to it. I thought I hit a good ball."[8] The kick became known as the "double doink" after NBC color commentator Cris Collinsworth stated immediately afterward, "Oh my goodness, the Bears' season is going to end on a double doink".[9] The next day, the NFL officially declared the kick had been blocked by Hester instead of declaring it a Parkey missed field goal attempt.[10]
Both offensive units relied much more on the passing game than the rushing one. Chicago quarterback Trubisky completed 26 passes out of 43 attempts for a total 303 yards and a touchdown, while Philadelphia's Foles completed 25 passes out of 40 for 266 yards and two scores. Meanwhile, the Eagles offense totaled 42 yards from 23 carries and the Bears totaled 65 yards from 18 carries, ending up as the last and second-to-last team in rushing yards at the wild card weekend, respectively. Robinson was the top receiver of the game, with 10 receptions, 143 yards and a score.
The final drive of the first half included a controversial play. With 0:36 left, Trubisky threw a pass down the field to Miller, who apparently caught the ball, but was then broken up by Eagles cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc. The play was ruled an incomplete pass by the referees, but upon reviewing it, it looked like it was indeed a complete pass, then fumbled as Miller became a runner. However, that hypothetical fumble was not recovered by anyone and the ruling on the field was upheld. While that was misunderstood by most viewers, the NFL rule book states that in this situation, "if there is no video evidence of a clear recovery […] the ruling of incomplete stands."[11]

Kansas City dominated the game the whole way through, racking up 433 yards and 29 first downs, while holding the Colts to 263 yards, 15 first downs and 0-for-9 on third down conversions. Kansas City would go to the AFC Championship Game for the first time since 1993 and the second time in franchise history.
In the first quarter alone, the Chiefs gained 185 yards and nine first downs, while holding Indianapolis to 12 yards and no first downs. Following a Colts punt on the opening drive, Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes led the team 75 yards in five plays, including his 44-yard completion to Sammy Watkins, to score on Damien Williams' 10-yard touchdown run. Indianapolis was quickly forced to punt again and the Chiefs stormed back for another touchdown. This time, they drove 65 yards in eight plays to take a 14–0 lead with receiver Tyreek Hill's 36-yard touchdown run on an end around play. The Colts went three-and-out for the third time in row and Kansas City took off for another scoring drive as the first quarter ended. Mahomes completed 5-of-10 passes for 47 yards as the team advanced 48 yards in 15 plays to go up 17–0 on Harrison Butker's 39-yard field goal.
With six minutes left in the second quarter, Indianapolis finally managed to strike back when Colts linebacker Najee Goode blocked Dustin Colquitt's punt and Zach Pascal recovered it in the end zone for a touchdown to make the score 17–7. But the Colts' defense still could not stop the Chiefs as Mahomes completed a 30-yard pass to tight end Travis Kelce on the first play of their ensuing drive. One play later, Mahomes hooked up with Hill for a 14-yard completion on the Colts' 26-yard line. Kansas City was on the move and did not stop until Mahomes finished the possession with a 4-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 24–7. Indianapolis got the ball back with 1:40 left in the half. On their first play, Andrew Luck completed a 21-yard pass to Eric Ebron, giving the Colts their first first down of the game. He then followed it up with a 12-yard pass to Dontrelle Inman. The drive continued until the Colts reached the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but with only three seconds left in the half, 46-year old kicker Adam Vinatieri hit the left upright on his 23-yard field goal attempt—his shortest missed field goal in 23 NFL seasons.
Kansas City started the second half with a drive to the Colts' 33-yard line, but this time failed to score as Mahomes was sacked by Denico Autry for a 5-yard loss while trying to convert on 4th-and-5. Following some punts, Indianapolis got a big scoring opportunity when Shaquille Leonard forced and recovered a fumble from Watkins on the Chiefs' 20-yard line. But on the Colts' ensuing drive, Chiefs lineman Dee Ford forced a fumble while sacking Luck and linebacker Justin Houston recovered it with 50 seconds left in the third quarter.
There would no more scoring until 5:30 remained in the game, when Luck finished an 87-yard drive with a 29-yard touchdown pass to T. Y. Hilton, cutting the score to 24–13 after Vinatieri missed the extra point, the first time he had missed such an attempt in the postseason. But any chance of a Colts comeback was ended on the Chiefs' following drive, starting with Tremon Smith's 23-yard kickoff return to the Chiefs' 39-yard line. From there, Damien Williams rushed seven times for 50 yards as the team drove 56 yards in nine plays to score on Darrel Williams' 6-yard rushing touchdown, making the score 31–13 and putting the game out of reach.
Mahomes finished his first playoff game 27-for-41 for 278 yards while also rushing for 8 yards and a touchdown. Kelce was his leading receiver with seven receptions for 108 yards, while Hill caught eight passes for 72 yards, rushed for 36 yards and a touchdown, and gained 6 yards returning punts. Damien Williams, who had been thrust into the starting lineup late in the season to replace the departed Kareem Hunt and the injured Spencer Ware, finished his first playoff game with 25 carries for 129 yards and a touchdown, along with five receptions for 25 yards. Houston had two tackles for a loss, two sacks and a fumble recovery. Luck completed 19-of-36 passes for 203 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 17 yards. Leonard had 14 tackles (10 solo), a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.
This would also be Luck's last game in the NFL, as he retired before the commencement of the 2019 NFL season.

This was the ninth time these two franchises met in the postseason, extending their NFL record. Los Angeles gained 459 yards, including 273 yards on the ground, with running backs C. J. Anderson and Todd Gurley both rushing for 100 yards each as they earned their first playoff win since the 2004 season and went to their first NFC Championship since 2001. On the other side of the ball, their defense limited Ezekiel Elliott, the league's leading rusher during the season, to just 47 yards on 20 carries.
The Rams advanced 57 yards in 11 plays on their opening drive, the longest a 19-yard completion from Jared Goff to tight end Tyler Higbee, to score on Greg Zuerlein's 25-yard field goal and take a 3–0 lead. Dallas responded by advancing the ball 71 yards in 7 plays, featuring a 20-yard run by Elliott. On the next play, Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Amari Cooper, giving the team a 7–3 lead. Los Angeles then drove 70 yards in 16 plays, but ended up having to settle for another Zuerlein field goal that made the score 7–6 with 31 seconds left in the first quarter.
The next time the Rams got the ball, Goff completed three of four pass attempts for 47 yards, while Anderson finished the drive with a pair of carries, the first for 14 yards and the second a 1-yard touchdown run that put the team up 13–7. Then JoJo Natson returned Dallas' next punt 12 yards to the Rams' 36-yard line, where the team went on to drive 64 yards in six plays, scoring with Gurley's 35-yard touchdown run that upped their lead to 20–7. The Cowboys were soon forced to punt again, giving Los Angeles one last chance to score before halftime. They managed to advance to the Dallas 45-yard line, but as time in the half expired, Zuerlein missed a 63-yard field goal attempt.
Dallas' offensive futility continued in the second half as they had to punt for the fourth consecutive drive and the Rams drove back for more points. A 21-yard completion from Goff to Brandin Cooks and an 18-yard run from Gurley set up Zuerlein's third field goal, from 44 yards, that put the Rams up 23–7. But this time, the Cowboys' offense finally managed to get a drive going, advancing 75 yards in nine plays. Receiver Michael Gallup caught passes for gains of 27 and 44 yards, while Elliott converted a 4th-and-1 with a 5-yard carry, and later finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. Then Prescott completed a pass to Cooper for a two-point conversion, cutting their deficit to 23–15 with 5:20 left in the third quarter. After forcing the Rams to punt, Dallas drove to the Los Angeles 35-yard line. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Elliott attempted to again convert a 4th-and-1, but this time he was stopped by Rams defenders John Johnson and Lamarcus Joyner for no gain.
The Rams then went on to drive 65 yards in 12 plays, successfully converting their own 4th-and-1 with a 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson to put themselves in front 30–15 with just over seven minutes left in the game. Prescott started off the Cowboys' next drive with a 24-yard completion to Gallup on the Rams' 49-yard line and later converted a 4th-and-1 with a 2-yard run. Eventually the team found themselves facing 4th-and-3 on the Rams' 17-yard line. Prescott's pass on the next play was incomplete, but defensive back Aqib Talib was penalized for committing pass interference in the end zone, giving them first and goal on the 1-yard line, where Prescott eventually ran the ball into the end zone, making the score 30–22 with 2:11 left. After the ensuing touchback, Dallas forced the Rams into a 3rd-and-7, but Goff ran 9 yards for a first down, enabling Los Angeles to run out the clock and win the game.

New England piled up 347 yards in the first half and scored touchdowns on five of their first six possessions to defeat the Chargers, which sent the Patriots to the AFC championship game for the eighth consecutive season.[12]
The Patriots started the game by driving 83 yards in 14 plays, scoring on Sony Michel's 1-yard touchdown run. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers quickly led his team right back, completing an 18-yard pass to Mike Williams on 3rd-and-15 before tying the game on a 43-yard touchdown completion to Keenan Allen. New England then drove 67 yards in 7 plays, the longest a 28-yard completion from Tom Brady to receiver Julian Edelman. On the next play, Michel ran 14 yards to the end zone to give the Patriots a 14–7 lead with less than a minute left in the first quarter.
Los Angeles had to punt after three plays and Edelman returned it 6 yards to the Patriots' 42-yard line. Then he caught passes for gains of 11 and 17 yards as New England drove 58 yards to take a 21–7 lead on Brady's 15-yard touchdown pass to receiver Phillip Dorsett. Following another Chargers punt, Brady completed a 25-yard pass to running back James White on New England's first play. A few plays later, Michel took off for a 40-yard run to the Chargers' 9-yard line, where Rex Burkhead took the ball to the end zone over the next two plays, the second a 6-yard touchdown run to put the Patriots up 28–7. The next time New England got the ball, they were forced into a three-and-out, but Chargers returner Desmond King muffed their punt and Albert McClellan recovered it for the Patriots on the Chargers' 35-yard line. Brady then started the ensuing possession with a 19-yard completion to Edelman, while Michel finished it with his third touchdown run, a 5-yard carry, that put the team up 35–7 with 1:40 left in the half. They nearly scored again after forcing a Los Angeles punt, but Dorsett was tackled on the Chargers' 30-yard line as time expired.
In the first half alone, Brady completed 23-of-29 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown, Michel had 16 carries for 105 yards and three touchdowns, White caught 10 passes for 71 yards, and Edelman caught 7 passes for 107 yards while also returning 3 punts for 31 yards.
Los Angeles had to punt on their opening drive of the second half and Brady's 25-yard completion to tight end Rob Gronkowski set up a 28-yard Stephen Gostkowski field goal, increasing New England's lead to 38–7. This time the Chargers were able to respond, as Williams caught 3 passes for 40 yards as the team drove 72 yards in 10 plays to score on Melvin Gordon's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting the score to 38–14. But Los Angeles' defense still could not contain New England, as Brady's completions to Edelman and White for gains of 35 and 23 yards lead to another Gostkowski field goal, giving the Patriots a 41–14 lead with 12:27 left.
Following a few punts, Rivers completed passes to Tyrell Williams and Allen for gains of 29 and 32 yards as the team drove to score on his 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Virgil Green. Then he completed a pass to Allen for a two-point conversion, making the score 41–22 with 7:28 left. After failing to recover an onside kick, the Chargers forced a punt, but Patriots defensive back Stephon Gilmore ended their following drive with an interception. By the time Los Angeles got the ball back, only three minutes remained, which they used to drive 80 yards in 12 plays to score on Rivers' 8-yard pass to tight end Antonio Gates, making the final score 41–28 following a failed two-point conversion attempt.
Brady completed 34-of-44 passes for 343 yards and a touchdown. Edelman caught 9 passes for 131 yards and returned 5 punts for 37 yards, moving to second place all-time in playoff receptions, behind only Jerry Rice. White tied an all-time playoff record with 15 receptions for 97 yards. Michel ran 24 times for 129 yards and three touchdowns, and caught a pass for 9 yards. Rivers finished the day 25-of-51 for 331 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. Tyrell Williams was his top receiver with 5 receptions for 94 yards.
With this win, Tom Brady improved his record against Rivers to 8–0 (counting regular season and playoff games).[13]
Down judge Sarah Thomas became the first woman to officiate an NFL postseason game and second woman to officiate a postseason game in one of the four major North American professional sports leagues, following the NBA’s Violet Palmer.

New Orleans had defeated the Eagles 48–7 during the regular season, and while the score of this game would be much closer, the result did not change. Though Philadelphia scored touchdowns on their first two drives, the Saints' defense managed to shut them out for the rest of the game, clinching the win with an interception by Marshon Lattimore in the closing minutes on the Eagles' final possession.
Philadelphia got off to a strong start as cornerback Cre'Von LeBlanc intercepted Saints quarterback Drew Brees' pass on the game's first play, giving the Eagles a first down on the New Orleans 24-yard line. The Eagles then drove 76 yards in seven plays to score on Nick Foles' 37-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Matthews. The Saints soon had to punt, and Philadelphia drove back for more points. Their next drive covered 75 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 30-yard reception by Alshon Jeffery. Foles finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run on a QB sneak, giving his team a 14–0 lead before the Saints had managed to gain a single yard on offense.
New Orleans' third drive fared no better as they had to punt after Brees was sacked twice, the second time losing a fumble that was recovered by offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk. But in what turned out to be a crucial momentum-shifting play, Lattimore made a leaping interception of a Foles pass on the Saints' 21-yard line with 13:35 left in the half.
New Orleans then drove to a 4th-and-1 on their own 30-yard line and sent their punt unit onto the field. Playing from the blocking back position in the formation, backup quarterback Taysom Hill took a direct snap and ran four yards for a first down, extending the drive. On the next play, Brees completed a 42-yard pass to Michael Thomas on the Eagles' 24-yard line. Eventually, the Saints faced 4th-and-goal from the 2-yard line and managed to convert again, this time with Brees' 2-yard touchdown pass to receiver Keith Kirkwood to finish off the 12-play, 79-yard drive with 7:23 left in the half. After the next three drives resulted in punts, New Orleans got the ball on their own 6-yard line with 1:18 remaining in the half. Brees subsequently completed four successive passes for 71 yards as the team drove to a 45-yard field goal by Wil Lutz, making the score 14–10 at halftime.
After forcing the Eagles to punt on the opening second-half possession, New Orleans went on the longest drive of the postseason to that point, covering 92 yards in 18 plays and taking 11:29 off the clock, which included overcoming a 41-yard touchdown completion called back by a holding penalty. Brees made two clutch first down completions on the drive, throwing a 20-yard pass to Thomas on 2nd-and-20 from the Saints' 44-yard line, and later hitting Thomas again for 20 yards to convert a 3rd-and-16. After this, Alvin Kamara's 15-yard run moved the ball to the Eagles' 2-yard line, and Brees completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to Thomas on the next play, giving the Saints their first lead of the game at 17–14 with 1:40 left in the third quarter.
After forcing the Eagles to punt, New Orleans drove 62 yards, including a 36-yard run by Mark Ingram II, to take a 20–14 lead on Lutz's 39-yard field goal with 10:28 left. Following another Eagles punt, the Saints drove 41 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 22-yard completion from Brees to Thomas on 3rd-and-13. With 3:03 remaining, they had a chance to put the game away, but Lutz missed a 52-yard field goal attempt wide to the right, giving the ball to Philadelphia on their 42-yard line. After driving to the Saints' 27-yard line, Foles threw a pass that went through the hands of Jeffery and was intercepted by Lattimore with 1:50 remaining, enabling New Orleans to run out the clock.
Brees finished the game 28-for-38 for 301 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. Thomas caught 12 passes for a franchise postseason record 171 yards and a touchdown. Kamara rushed for 71 yards, caught four passes for 35 yards, and returned two kickoffs for 45 yards. Lattimore had eight tackles (four solo) and two interceptions. Foles completed 18-of-31 passes for 201 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions. His rushing touchdown made him the third player in the Super Bowl era to have a rushing, receiving and passing touchdown in the postseason.

Though the Rams outgained the Saints in total yards 378 to 290, they never held the lead at any point in regulation. But after Greg Zuerlein made a 48-yard field goal with 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter to send the game into overtime, John Johnson's clutch interception set Zuerlein up for a 57-yard field goal (the second longest in postseason history) to win the game.
New Orleans took the opening kickoff and drove 56 yards in 11 plays, the longest a 21-yard completion from Drew Brees to running back Alvin Kamara. Wil Lutz finished the drive with a 37-yard field goal to give the Saints a 3–0 lead. Then Saints linebacker Demario Davis intercepted a pass that bounced out of the hands of running back Todd Gurley, giving his team a first down on the Rams' 13-yard line. Three plays later, Lutz kicked a 29-yard field goal to put New Orleans up 6–0. Los Angeles was quickly forced to punt, and the Saints soon drove for more points. Brees started his next drive with a 24-yard completion to tight end Josh Hill, and later converted a 3rd-and-3 with a 19-yard pass to Michael Thomas. Brees eventually finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown toss to tight end Garrett Griffin, who had been promoted from the practice squad just two weeks earlier after missing the entire regular season. This gave New Orleans a 13–0 lead with 1:35 left in the first quarter.
The Rams took the ball back and soon faced 4th-and-5, but managed to keep the drive going with a fake punt in which punter Johnny Hekker threw the ball to Sam Shields for 12 yards, giving the Rams a first down for the first time in the game with 14 minutes left in the second quarter. The possession ended up going on for 14 plays and 62 yards before Zuerlein finished it with a 36-yard field goal to make the score 13–3. After the next three possessions of the game ended in punts, Los Angeles got the ball with 1:52 left in the half. Quarterback Jared Goff started the drive with a pair of completions to Josh Reynolds for 22 total yards. Following two incompletions, he converted a 3rd-and-10 with a 17-yard pass to Brandin Cooks. On the next play, Goff completed a 36-yard pass to Cooks on the Saints' 6-yard line. Gurley then ran the ball in for a touchdown, cutting the Rams' deficit to 13–10 at halftime.
After forcing the Rams to punt on the opening possession of the second half, New Orleans drove 71 yards in 12 plays, mainly on the strength of running backs Mark Ingram II and Kamara. Ingram rushed three times for 25 yards on the drive, while Kamara had a 6-yard carry while also catching four passes for 34 yards. Brees ended the drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass to Taysom Hill, increasing the Saints' lead to 20–10. Los Angeles responded by moving the ball 70 yards in 10 plays, including a 25-yard reception by Cooks and a 16-yard run by Reynolds on an end around play. With 3 minutes left in the third quarter, Goff converted a 3rd-and-goal with a 1-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Higbee, cutting the Rams' deficit to 20–17.
The next three drives of the game resulted in punts, the last one a 44-yard kick by Thomas Morstead that pinned the Rams back on their 9-yard line. Goff then completed passes to Gerald Everett and Reynolds for gains of 39 and 33 yards as the team drove 90 yards in nine plays. Zuerlein kicked a field goal to tie the score 20–20 with just over five minutes left in regulation. Kamara returned the following kickoff 30 yards to the Rams' 35-yard line. Four plays later, Brees completed a 43-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. on the Los Angeles 13-yard line. Two plays later, with the Saints facing 3rd-and-10, Brees threw a pass to receiver Tommylee Lewis, who was covered by Nickell Robey-Coleman. A hit by Robey-Coleman knocked Lewis to the ground and the pass fell incomplete. Replays showed that Robey-Coleman made contact with Lewis long before the ball arrived. However, no flag was thrown and the Saints had to settle for Lutz's third field goal, from 31 yards, which gave them a 23–20 lead with 1:26 remaining. On the Rams' ensuing drive, Goff completed a 19-yard pass to Reynolds and then threw a 16-yard pass to Robert Woods to convert a 3rd-and-3 and give Los Angeles the ball on the Saints' 33-yard line. Three plays later, Zuerlein's 48-yard field goal tied the score with 8 seconds left on the clock and sent the game into overtime.[15]
New Orleans got the ball at the start of overtime and drove to their 40-yard line. On the next play, Ingram was tackled by Aaron Donald for a 6-yard loss. Then as Brees attempted to make a desperate throw, he was hit by Rams lineman Dante Fowler, resulting in a high floating pass that was intercepted by John Johnson at the Rams' 46-yard line. Goff started Los Angeles' ensuing drive with a 12-yard pass to Higbee. Then after Anderson was dropped for a 3-yard loss, Goff's 6-yard pass to Higbee moved the ball to the Saints' 39-yard line. Goff's next pass was incomplete, and Zuerlein was brought out to kick a 57-yard field goal, which he did to give the Rams a 26–23 win.
After the game, Saints coach Sean Payton protested bitterly about the non-call after Robey-Coleman's hit on Lewis on the final play of the Saints' fourth-quarter field goal drive. "For a call like that not to be made, man, it's just hard to swallow. And then to get a phone call ..." Payton said, trailing off. He added: "We spoke initially, then I called to follow up. And the first thing [head of officials Alberto Riveron] said when I got on the phone—'We messed it up.' Payton later said it was the type of foul you'd call "if we were playing pickup football in the backyard."[16][17] Eight days later, the NFL released a statement officially admitting the play was blown and should have been penalized.[18]
Two Saints season ticket holders filed a lawsuit against the NFL over the incident, attempting to force the league to use its unfair act provisions and replay the game from the point of the missed call. The league, which has never used these provisions, opposed the action on the grounds that it could force the Super Bowl to be postponed.[19] On January 31, 2019, U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan in New Orleans ruled that the ticket holders could not compel the NFL or NFL Commissioner to enforce a rule that would change the result of the game or schedule a replay of the game.[20] In response, Louisianans boycotted Super Bowl LIII.[21] In the following season, the NFL changed their rules to allow pass interference calls (and non-calls) to be subject to replay challenge.[22]
Goff completed 25-of-40 passes for 297 yards, a touchdown and an interception, while also rushing for 10 yards. Cooks caught seven passes for 107 yards, while Reynolds caught four passes for 74 yards and rushed for 16 yards. Rams linebacker Cory Littleton had 12 tackles (11 solo). Brees completed 26-of-40 passes for 249 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Kamara rushed for 15 yards, caught 11 passes for 96 yards, and had four kickoff returns for 119 yards.
The previous postseason meeting of these two teams was in the 2000–01 wild card playoffs when the Saints eliminated the Rams 31–28; at the time Rams were based in St. Louis and were the defending Super Bowl champions.

New England outgained the Chiefs in total yards 524–290, and managed to prevent their defense, which led the league in sacks during the season, from getting any sacks in this game.[23] Still, it would take an overtime touchdown by Rex Burkhead to put Kansas City away after a wild, back and forth fourth quarter in which the teams combined to score 38 points as the lead changed four times.[24]
The Patriots dominated the first half, holding Kansas City scoreless and limiting them to just 32 total yards. On the game's opening drive, New England running back Sony Michel rushed 6 times for 32 yards as the team drove 80 yards in 15 plays to score on his 1-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, the Patriots drove to a 1st-and-goal from the Chiefs' 5-yard line, but this time they failed to score. On 3rd down, linebacker Reggie Ragland intercepted Tom Brady's pass in the end zone for a touchback with 13:45 left in the half. After a few punts, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes completed a 42-yard pass to Tyreek Hill on the Patriots' 23-yard line. On 3rd-and-9, Mahomes was sacked by Trey Flowers for a 14-yard loss, pushing Kansas City back to the 36-yard line, where they decided to punt rather than risk a long field goal attempt. Dustin Colquitt's 26-yard punt pinned New England back on their own 10-yard line; they still managed to drive to a 14–0 lead, with Brady completing a 30-yard pass to running back James White before hooking up with Phillip Dorsett for a 29-yard scoring play with 27 seconds left in the half.
The Chiefs managed to rally back on the opening drive of the second half. When faced with 3rd-and-2 after two plays, Mahomes burned the Patriots' defense with a 54-yard completion to Sammy Watkins, and followed it up with a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Travis Kelce, making the score 14–7. Later in the quarter, New England receiver Julian Edelman returned a punt 13 yards to the Chiefs' 37-yard line, setting up Stephen Gostkowski's 47-yard field goal that increased the Patriots' lead to 17–7. Kansas City responded by driving 75 yards in 9 plays, featuring Mahomes' 33-yard completion to running back Damien Williams. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Williams finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown reception, cutting the score to 17–14.
New England took the ball back and advanced to a 4th-and-1 on the Chiefs' 25-yard line. They attempted to convert with a run by Burkhead, but safety Daniel Sorensen broke through the line and tackled him for no gain. However, Kansas City soon had to punt. Officials ruled that Edelman muffed the punt and the Chiefs recovered the ball, but the call was overturned via video review.[25] Two plays later, Brady threw a pass that bounced off Edelman's fingertips and was intercepted by Sorensen, who returned it 14 yards to the Patriots' 23-yard line. Following an incompletion, Mahomes threw a short pass to Williams, who raced down the left sideline for a 23-yard touchdown completion, giving Kansas City their first lead at 21–17, with 7:45 left in regulation. New England then drove 75 yards in 10 plays to retake the lead at 24–21, the longest being a 14-yard run by Burkhead, capped off with Michel's 10-yard touchdown run from 4th-and-inches. The Patriots' touchdown drive was kept alive by a controversial roughing the passer call against Chiefs defensive lineman Chris Jones, so instead of third-and-long the Patriots got 15 yards and a first down.[26] Following the Patriots' touchdown, Kansas City quickly took advantage of a lost fumble that was eliminated due to a holding penalty on Patriots defensive back J. C. Jackson, and a later pass interference penalty on Jackson that gained them 23 yards. Mahomes then threw a 38-yard completion to Watkins on the 2-yard line, and Williams ran the ball in for a touchdown on the next play; Kansas City led 28–24 with just over two minutes left in regulation.
Cordarrelle Patterson returned the ensuing kickoff 38 yards to the 35-yard line. Then Brady threw passes to Edelman and Chris Hogan for gains of 20 and 11 yards; Hogan's one-handed catch was upheld on review.[27] After an incompletion, Chiefs defensive back Charvarius Ward appeared to put the game away with an interception, only to see it overturned by a penalty against linebacker Dee Ford, who had lined up in the neutral zone before the ball was snapped.[28] On the next play, Brady threw a 25-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski on the Kansas City 4-yard line. Then Burkhead scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, giving New England a 31–28 lead with 39 seconds left. After Tremon Smith's 26-yard kickoff return gave the Chiefs the ball on their 31-yard line, Mahomes completed a 21-yard pass to running back Spencer Ware, and a 27-yard completion to Demarcus Robinson, to set up Harrison Butker's 39-yard field goal with six seconds left, sending the game into overtime, the first such instance in an AFC Championship game since 1986.[29]
After winning the overtime coin toss, New England drove 75 yards in 13 plays for the game-winning touchdown. Edelman caught two third-down passes on the drive for gains of 20 and 15 yards, while Burkhead covered the final 15 yards to the end zone with a 10-yard run, a 3-yard run, and a 2-yard rushing touchdown.[24][30]
Brady completed 30-of-46 passes for 348 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. Edelman caught seven passes for 98 yards and returned three punts for 38 yards. Patterson returned 3 kickoffs for 80 yards and caught 2 passes for 16 yards. Michel was the top rusher of the game with 29 carries for 113 yards and two touchdowns. This gave him five total rushing touchdowns for the postseason, a rookie record.[31] Linebacker Kyle Van Noy had 10 tackles (2 solo), two sacks and a forced fumble. Mahomes finished the game 16-of-31 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for 11 yards. Williams rushed for 30 yards, caught five passes for 66 yards, and scored three touchdowns. Watkins was the game's leading receiver with four receptions for 114 yards. Smith had four kickoff returns for 99 yards. Sorensen had 14 tackles (11 solo) and an interception. After the game, the Chiefs fired defensive coordinator Bob Sutton.
This was the Patriots' first postseason win on the road since 2006.

This was the first Super Bowl since 2012 to not feature a top seed from either conference, and the first time that both number two seeds qualified.[32] This was the Patriots' third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. The Rams last made an appearance in 2001 when the team was based in St. Louis, coincidentally, facing the Patriots, their first as a Los Angeles based team since 1979. The Patriots won that game 20–17 on a field goal, as time expired, by Adam Vinatieri. The Patriots' current head coach–starting quarterback tandem of Bill Belichick and Tom Brady were only active personnel left from the previous title game against the Rams.[33] The Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl in 18 years (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016), and tied the Pittsburgh Steelers with the most Super Bowl wins. The Rams won their only Super Bowl in 1999, which was coincidentally hosted by Atlanta, and extended their drought to 20 years. This was the Patriots' 11th Super Bowl appearance (ninth under Brady and Belichick) and the Rams' fourth. The first half was the lowest scoring half (three points) since Super Bowl IX (two points). In the lowest scoring Super Bowl in NFL history, the Patriots won 13–3 to claim their sixth Super Bowl.

Television coverage[edit]
All playoff games were broadcast nationally on network television.
In a change from previous Wild Card Weekends, NBC aired the late Sunday afternoon NFC game as a lead-in to their coverage of the Golden Globe Awards.[34] ABC and ESPN simulcasted the AFC wild card game on Saturday afternoon, Fox aired the Saturday primetime NFC game, and CBS broadcast the other AFC playoff game in the early Sunday window.[35]
Fox then had both NFC divisional games, while CBS and NBC had one AFC divisional game each. Fox had exclusive coverage of the NFC Championship Game. CBS had exclusive coverage of the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl LIII.[35]

Bucetin (INN, BAN) is an analgesic and antipyretic that is no longer marketed.[1][2]  Chemically, it is similar to phenacetin with which it shares the risk of carcinogenesis.[3]  Bucetin was withdrawn from use in 1986 due to renal toxicity.[4]

The Forcefield Kids is the debut solo studio album by American hip hop musician Passage.[10] It was released on Anticon in 2004. "Creature in the Classroom" was released as a single from the album.[11] The album peaked at number 80 on the CMJ Top 200 chart,[12] as well as number 7 on the CMJ Hip Hop chart.[13]


Critical reception[edit]
Liam Singer of Pitchfork gave the album a 6.6 out of 10, saying: "The stark contrasts of images and styles combined with the musical assault give the impression of Passage as an ADD-addled teen in a room full of keyboards and samplers, letting loose the ravings of his sugar-soaked subconscious."[6] Christopher R. Weingarten of CMJ New Music Monthly said, "Passage emotes about education, race and loneliness in those Anticon-oclastic beat poetics that ride the fence between astute imagery and non-sequitur."[3] Melissa Wheeler of Exclaim! said, "there's a lot going on, which can make the album seem disorganised and uninspired, but after a few listens it becomes clear that Passage does alright in his organised mess."[5]

"Fresh Out the Oven" is a song recorded by American singer Jennifer Lopez, featuring American rapper Pitbull. The mid-tempo electro-R&B song was written by Amanda Ghost, Lopez, Pitbull and Pharrell Williams, while production was handled by The Neptunes. Ghost brought the song to Lopez, who although loved it, didn't think it matched the sound of the music she had been recording at the time. Lopez eventually decided to record the song and release it as a promotional single in anticipation of her seventh studio album Love? (2011). The song premiered online on October 7, 2009 and was promoted to clubs in the United States by Epic Records.
An accompanying music video for "Fresh Out the Oven" was directed by Jonas Akerlund, which features the use of repetitious images for a hypnotic effect and avoids showing any of the actors' faces until the final act. "Fresh Out the Oven" received generally positive acclaim from music critics. The song managed to reach number one on the U.S. Dance Club Chart.


Background[edit]
Pitbull's appearance on "Fresh Out the Oven" led the two to work together on several other recordings, such as "On the Floor", "Dance Again" and "Live It Up".
Following the commercial and critical failure of her sixth studio album Brave (2007)—and while pregnant with twins Max and Emme—Lopez began working on new music for a future project in 2008.[1] The project was kept under wraps until February 2009 when a new song from the recording sessions titled "Hooked on You" leaked online.[2] Lopez addressed the leak on her official website in May 2009, stating that "I'm always excited about my music and this ["Hooked on You"] is one of a few tracks I'm currently working on. I'm flattered by everyone's interest in the track and really excited for you to hear the real thing..."[3] Following the leak of "Hooked on You", "One Love" and "What Is Love?" (later re-titled "(What Is) Love?") were subsequently leaked online in May. The leaked songs were, at the time, meant to appear on a greatest hits album; that later turned into a studio album.[4] In June 2009, Lopez told MTV's Larry Carol that the songs hinted at the musical direction of her then-upcoming seventh studio album. She also stated that she was keen to finish the album and several singles, with a potential release date for the end of 2009.[1]
On the red carpet of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, American rapper Pitbull revealed that he had recorded a new track with Lopez that would be released as the first single from her then-upcoming seventh studio album.[5] The song's title, initially announced by Pitbull as "Lola", was later revealed to be called "Fresh Out the Oven".[6] Despite Pitbull announcing the song to be the first single from Lopez's seventh studio album, it was later announced that the song would only serve as a buzz single and would not appear on her album.[5] The song made its premiere on October 7 via People.com.[7]

Music and lyrics[edit]




"Fresh Out the Oven" (2009)

A sample of the chorus to "Fresh Out the Oven", a mid-tempo electro-R&B song.
Problems playing this file? See media help.

"Fresh Out the Oven" is a mid-tempo electro-R&B song, with a length of three minutes and thirty-five seconds (3:35).[8] The song was co-written by Lopez, along with Amanda Ghost, Pitbull and Pharrell Williams, who produced the song with his production team The Neptunes.[9] Lopez opens the first verse of the song by the lines: "Now don't tell me that you love me to get with this / You say you stay forever / But it don't make sense".[10] According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, the song is a throwback "to her dancehall / dance-chart days" and a reminder that "she'll always be that Fly Girl".[11] An editor from website Código Venezuela named the song "a theme that blends hip hop with electronic sounds, leaving a sensual interpretation by Lopez while her partner makes its peculiar mixture of Spanish with English".[12] In an interview in March 2010, Lopez said about the song: "The head of my record company, Amanda, really loved this record. She said, 'This record is for Jennifer Lopez. We've got to get this record to Jennifer Lopez'. She let me hear it and I said, 'You know what? I love the record, but it doesn't fit in with the album I'm making. And she said, I don't care. You just have to record this record. I don't care if you put another name on it. And so we did and we put it out and it went to No.1".[13]

Reception[edit]
Critical response[edit]
Nick Levine from Digital Spy said of the song when it first appeared online, "Truth be told, the track's a pretty standard sexy electro-R&B jam, but the Lola persona is reasonably intriguing, even if it does have a hint of the Sasha Fierce to it. It's very much a case of wait and see what happens next, we suppose."[8] Elena Gorgan of Softpedia made similar comments. saying that "Of course, there is little substance to the lyrics of 'Fresh Out the Oven' but, critics say, substance is perhaps the last thing Lopez needs right now if she wants to regain her well-deserved first position in the charts, especially in the light of her latest not too brilliant releases. As far as the song is concerned, it’s written to make the listener want to get to the dancefloor and move to the beat, they say. Because of this, if accompanied by a good video with awesome choreography – the kind Lopez knows how to do so well – and enough promotion, this could turn into a massive hit on all fronts."[14]
DJ Booth said of the song: "I give you Jennifer Lopez (or Lola, as she now wants to be called). Coming off an extended wedding/pregnancy hiatus from the music community, Lola is now toting sexy around like an expensive fashion accessory. For her welcome-back single, Lola joins forces with fellow Latino Pitbull over a typically synth-driven Pharrell beat to show the world that even though she’s years removed from the peak of her career, she’s still 'Fresh out the Oven'."[15] Ryan Brockington of the New York Post gave a positive review of the song, saying it has a "tight, sassy, radio friendly sound". He continued by stating that: "The track's surprising hottness could be because she not only tapped Pitbull to appear but she also had hit-makers the Neptunes produce the puppy".[16]

Commercial performance[edit]
The song charted in mid-November 2009, but went unnoticed until the week of December 12, 2009 when the song shot up the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs to number 14. After nine weeks, it reached a new peak of number two. In its tenth week on the chart, it reached number one making it Lopez's third consecutive number one (seventh overall) dance hit following in the footsteps of 2007's "Do It Well" and 2008's "Hold It Don't Drop It". In its eleventh week, the song fell down the chart to number ten.[17] In its twelfth week the song fell another two places to number 12, whilst in its thirteenth week on the chart it fell another three places to 15,[18] with further descents in the subsequent weeks. According to Billboard the song failed to chart on any of the U.S. airplay charts.[19] "Fresh Out the Oven" finished in tenth place on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs year-end chart of 2010.[20]

Promotion[edit]
In October 2009, a Twitter account, MySpace page and teaser website, all in the name of Lola, were set up. They all featured a dancing female figure named Lola.[21] Rumors surfaced that Lopez had adopted Lola, as her alter-ego, however, this was confirmed as false by the president of Epic Records, Amanda Ghost. She said: "It's something fun. She hasn't become Sasha Fierce (Beyoncé Knowles' artistic alter ego). There won't be anything to do with Lola on her Love? album. This is a hot club record that the label loved and Jennifer thought was fun, Jennifer and Pitbull got together and the record leaked. Lola is a fun character just for this song".[5]
Lopez was in attendance at the LIV Nightclub in Miami on October 24, 2009, where the music video for "Fresh Out the Oven" was previewed.[22] The video premiered on Lopez's official website on November 20, 2009.[23] The clip was directed by Jonas Akerlund[24] and according to Lopez's official website its formally titled: "Fresh Out the Oven" starring Jennifer Lopez as Lola & featuring Pitbull.[25] The unrated director's cut was uploaded on director Jonas Akerlund’s official website in January 2010.[26] The video makes use of repetitious images for a hypnotic effect, and avoids showing any of the actors' faces until the final act. This focus on bodies in sexual positions led to comparisons with Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Focus on Style commented on Lopez's costumes and fashion during the video. According to the online magazine's style guide Lopez chose an Agent Provocateur leapard skin bodysuit.[27] It is similar in style to Lopez's younger contemporaries Katy Perry, Christina Aguilera, Daisy Lowe, Lily Allen, Scarlett Johansson though when Lopez wears it "baby its muy caliente!"[27]

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atlantoscia_floridana&oldid=1178169350"The Sugarland Run Valley Stream Trail is part of the Fairfax County, Virginia countywide trail system. The main portion of the asphalt trail runs approximately 3 miles, although a newer section of trail, which connects to the Washington & Old Dominion Trail, extends the length of the main trail to approximately 4 miles.[1] There are also many tributaries of this trail, several of which terminate in neighborhoods in the Town of Herndon, VA.
The trail passes by several basketball courts, and is a very popular trail for jogging and dog-walking. During very rainy periods, many (if not all) of the "fair weather crossings" may become impassible. These crossings mostly consist of flat, cylindrical concrete columns forming a step-way across the stream.[2] During less rainy periods, stream crossings tend to not be very deep, and most dogs can usually traverse the crossing without completely submerging.

Sugarland Run Stream Valley Trail
The first section of the trail, from Sugarland Road to Runnymeade Park, was constructed prior to 1997.[3][4] In 1998, with funding from a settlement with Colonial Pipeline Company for an oil spill and federal TEA-21 and CMAQ funding, design work began on a 1 mile extension to connect the trail to the Washington & Old Dominion Trail.[5] Construction on the extension began in 2004 and completed in October 2005.[6] It included almost 6,000 linear feet of paved trail, eight bridges for stream crossings and a boardwalk through a wetland area.[7] In 2019 nearly 12,000 liner feet of the trail were repaired.[8]

The Duchy of Nassau (German: Herzogtum Nassau) was an independent state between 1806 and 1866, located in what is now the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. It was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and later of the German Confederation. Its ruling dynasty, now extinct, was the House of Nassau.[1][2] The duchy was named for its historical core city, Nassau, although Wiesbaden rather than Nassau was its capital. In 1865, the Duchy of Nassau had 465,636 inhabitants. After being occupied and annexed into the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866 following the Austro-Prussian War, it was incorporated into the Province of Hesse-Nassau. The area today is a geographical and historical region, Nassau, and Nassau is also the name of the Nassau Nature Park within the borders of the former duchy.
Today, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg still uses "Duke of Nassau" as his secondary title, and "Prince" or "Princess of Nassau" is used as a title by other members of the grand ducal family. Nassau is also part of the name of the Dutch royal family, which styles itself Orange-Nassau.


Geography[edit]
Declaration of Nassau's sovereignty, 30 August 1806
Schloss Weilburg, residence of the Princes of Nassau-Weilburg before 1816, and a residence of the Dukes of Nassau thereafter
Schloss Biebrich, seat of the Dukes of Nassau from 1817 to 1841 and their summer residence thereafter
The territory of the duchy was essentially congruent with the Taunus and Westerwald mountain ranges. The southern and western borders were formed by the Main and the Rhine, while in the northern part of the territory, the Lahn river separated the two mountain ranges. The neighbouring territory to the east and south was the Grand Duchy of Hesse. The Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg and the Free City of Frankfurt were also to the east. To the west was the Rhine Province of the Prussia, which also controlled an exclave in the eastern part of Nassau, called Wetzlar.

Population[edit]
At its foundation in 1806, the Duchy had 302,769 inhabitants. The citizens were mostly farmers, day labourers, or artisans. In 1819, 7% of Nassauers lived in settlements with more than 2,000 inhabitants, while the rest lived in 850 smaller settlements and 1,200 isolated homesteads. Wiesbaden was the largest settlement with 5,000 inhabitants, and Limburg an der Lahn was the second-largest with around 2,600 inhabitants. By 1847, Wiesbaden had grown to 14,000 inhabitants and Limburg to 3,400. The third-largest city was Höchst am Main.

History[edit]
The ancestral and core coat of arms of Nassau, which formed the heart shield of the greater coat of arms. It is almost identical to the coat of arms of the Netherlands and is also included as the third and fourth field in the coat of arms of the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.
Establishment[edit]
The House of Nassau had produced many collateral lines in the course of its nearly one-thousand-year history. Up to the 18th century, the three main lines were the small princedoms of Nassau-Usingen, Nassau-Weilburg, and Nassau-Dietz (later Orange-Nassau), with large, scattered territories in what is now the Netherlands and Belgium. From 1736, many treaties and agreements were made between the different lines (The Nassau Family Pact), which prevented further splitting of territories and enabled general political co-ordination between the branches. In this context, the administrative subdivisions of the individual territories were adjusted, laying the foundations for the later unification of the territories.
After the War of the First Coalition (1792–1797), Nassau-Dietz lost its possessions in Belgium and the Netherlands, while Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg lost all their territories west of the Rhine to France. On the other hand, like other German secular principalities, the Nassaus gained territory that had formerly belonged to the church as a result of secularisation. The Nassaus participated in negotiations at the Second Congress of Rastatt (1797) and in Paris, in order to secure the territories of the Prince-Bishops of Mainz and Trier. The Imperial Recess of 1803 largely accorded with the desires of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg. Orange-Nassau had already agreed separate terms with Napoleon.
Nassau-Usingen had lost Saarbrücken, two-thirds of Saarwerden, Ottweiler, and some smaller territories (totalling 60,000 inhabitants and 447,000 guilders of income per year). In compensation, it received: from Mainz, Höchst, Königstein, Cronberg, Lahnstein and the Rheingau; from Cologne some districts on the east bank of the Rhine; from Bavaria, the sub-district of Kaub; from Hesse-Darmstadt, the lordship of Eppstein,  Katzenelnbogen, and Braubach; from Prussia, Sayn-Altenkirchen, Sayn-Hachenburg; and several cloisters were received from Mainz. Thus Nassau-Usingen regained its lost population and increased its annual income by around 130,000 guilders.
Nassau-Weilburg lost Kirchheim, Stauf, and its third of Saarwerden (15,500 inhabitants and 178,000 guilders in revenue). For these, it received many small possessions of Trier, including Ehrenbreitstein, Vallendar, Sayn, Montabaur, Limburg an der Lahn, three abbeys, and the holdings of Limburg Cathedral. This totalled 37,000 inhabitants and 147,000 guilders of revenue.
In the course of these arrangements, the Kammergut of the Princely house was considerably extended to more than 52,000 hectares of forests and agricultural land. These domains encompassed 11.5% of the flat land and yielded around a million guilders per year – the largest part of their total income.
Even before the actual Imperial Recess, in September and October 1802, both principalities deployed troops in the territories of Cologne and Mainz that they had received. In November and December, after civilian officials had taken possession of the territory, new oaths were sworn by officials of the previous regimes and the new subjects. According to the reports of Nassau officials, the new administrations were welcomed, or at least accepted without protest, in most regions, since the Nassau principalities were considered very liberal, compared to the former ecclesiastical rulers. Between December 1802 and September 1803, the wealth monasteries and religious communities were disbanded. The closures of monasteries without possessions continued until 1817 since the state had to provide pensions to monks and converses after disbanding their communities. Between October 1803 and February 1804, the territories of many Imperial Knights and other possessors of Imperial immediacy were occupied and annexed. Only in August/September 1806 were these acquisitions confirmed by edict, affirmed by the treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine. This process encountered considerable resistance, led by the Imperial Knights, but this resistance had no serious consequences and ultimately failed since the Nassau princes' seizures were enforced by French officials and soldiers.
On 17 July 1806, Prince Frederick Augustus of Nassau-Usingen and his cousin Prince Frederick William of Nassau-Weilburg joined the Confederation of the Rhine.  Prince Frederick Augustus, the senior member of the House of Nassau received the title of Sovereign Duke of Nassau, while Frederick William was granted the title of Sovereign Prince of Nassau. Under pressure from Napoleon I both counties merged to form the Duchy of Nassau on 30 August 1806, under the joint rule of Frederick Augustus and Frederick William. This decision was encouraged by the fact that Frederick Augustus had no male heirs and Frederick William was thus in line to inherit his principality anyway.
In 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, there was a further territorial expansion. When the Orange-Nassau line received the Dutch crown on 31 May, they had to surrender the Principality of Orange-Nassau to Prussia, which passed part of it to the Duchy of Nassau the next day.
Frederick William died from a fall on the stairs at Schloss Weilburg on 9 January 1816, and it was his son William who became the first sole Duke of Nassau after Frederick Augustus' death on 24 March 1816.

Reform period[edit]
Ernst Franz Ludwig Freiherr Marschall von Bieberstein, Chief Minister of Nassau (1806–1834)
The Chief ministers in 1806 were Hans Christoph Ernst von Gagern and Ernst Franz Ludwig von Bieberstein. Von Gagern resigned in 1811, after which von Bieberstein served alone until his death in 1834.
A series of reforms were carried out in the first years of the Duchy: the abolition of serfdom in 1806, the introduction of freedom of movement in 1810, and a fundamental tax reform in 1812, which replaced 991 direct taxes with a single progressive tax on land and trade. Degrading corporal punishment was abolished and the Kulturverordnung (cultivation ordinance) promoted the autonomous management of soil and land. After a transitional period with four districts, the new Duchy was consolidated into three districts on 1 August 1809: Wiesbaden, Weilburg, and Ehrenbreitstein. In turn, these were abolished in 1816, with the establishment of Wiesbaden as sole capital. The number of Amt subdivisions was slowly reduced, from sixty-two in 1806 to forty-eight in 1812. Due to the religious heterogeneity of the territory, a system of "combined schools" was introduced on 24 March 1817. On 14 March 1818, a state-wide public health system was established – the first such system in Germany.

Constitution of 1814[edit]
On 2 September 1814, a constitution was promulgated. It was the first modern constitution in any of the German states. Because there was (very limited) parliamentary involvement in government, especially in taxation, it was considered to be a "Parliamentary Constitution" in the language of the day. The constitution guaranteed the freedom of the individual, religious tolerance, and the freedom of the press. It was heavily influenced by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, who originally came from Nassau and had substantial holdings there. The princes encouraged his involvement because he was part of the class of Imperial Knights who had been dispossessed by them and due to his involvement, the opposition of the Knights was diminished. However, the legislation of the Concert of Europe period, especially the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, marked a new restriction of freedoms in Nassau as elsewhere.
On 28 December 1849, the constitution was replaced by a reformed constitution which took account of the democratic demands of the German revolutions of 1848–49. On 25 November 1851, this constitution was repealed and the old constitution was restored.

Parliament[edit]
The City School in Marktplatz, Wiesbaden, seat of the Nassau Parliament from 1818 to 1844
Under the constitution of 1814, the Parliament (Landstände) of Nassau had two chambers: a chamber of deputies (Landesdeputiertenversammlung) and a house of lords (Herrenbank). The eleven members of the house of lords were all princes of the House of Nassau or representatives of the nobility. The twenty-two members of the chamber of deputies were mostly elected by census suffrage but had to be land owners, except for three representatives of ecclesiastics and one representative of teachers.
Only four years after the establishment of the constitution, in 1818, did the first election in the Duchy take place. As a result, Parliament was prevented from playing a role in the establishment of the Duchy. The electorate consisted of 39 nobles, 1448 owners of substantial amounts of land, and 128 wealthy city dwellers. Given that the population of the Duchy at the time was about 287,000, this was a tiny number of electors.
The Parliament met for the first time on 3 March 1818.

The Nassau Domain dispute[edit]

At the foundation of the Duchy, Minister von Bieberstein established a strong fiscal distinction between the treasury of the general domain and that of the regional taxes. The domain, which included court estates and land, and mineral water springs, as well as the tithe and other feudal dues was the property of the Ducal House, which could not be used for paying state expenses and which Parliament had no power over. Even in the very earliest years of the Duchy, this system was loudly criticised. The parliamentary president Carl Friedrich Emil von Ibell in particular complained about this in letters to Bieberstein and petitions to the Duke, with ever greater frequency. His hostile position was one of the justifications for his impeachment in 1821.
In the following years, there was more debate with and within Parliament, as well as with the government, about the division between Ducal and state funds. The conflict only came out into the open, however, in the course of the July Revolution of 1830 sparked unrest in neighbouring countries. In 1831, the government prevented the submission of petitions to the Duke on the subject and held a joint manoeuvre in Rheingau with Austrian troops from the fortress in Mainz. At its next sitting, Parliament, which had not been very active up to this point, drafted several reform proposals, few of which were accepted. The issue of the Domain thus progressed to burning point. On 24 March, the deputies of the lower chamber put forward a proposal for the Domain to become property of the populace. The government forbade a public assemblies on this issue and announced the opposite opinion. To suppress any revolt following this decision, several hundred troops were called in from the neighbouring Grand Duchy of Hesse. However, no revolt actually broke out. In the press within the state and in the neighbouring principalities, articles in newspapers and pamphlets supported both sides of the issue.
The president of the chamber Georg Herber was the main figure on the side of the deputies, especially in a polemical piece published in the Hanauer Zeitung on 21 October 1831. At the end of 1831, the Nassau court began investigations against Herber. On 3 December 1832, Herber was finally sentenced to three years in prison for 'Abuse of the sovereign' and 'libel' against Bieberstein. On the night of 4 December, the president of the chamber was arrested as he slept in his bed. On 7 January 1833, he was released on bail. Herber's lawyer, August Hergenhahn [de], later the revolutionary Chief Minister of Nassau, attempted to get him a reduced sentence, but he was prevented. However, the sentence was never enforced, because Herber, who was very sick, died on 11 March 1833.
The Ducal government had already prepared to expand the house of lords in the course of 1831 and this was effected by an edict on 29 October 1831. The bourgeois were thus put into a minority and failed in their attempt to prevent the levying of taxation in November 1831. Additionally, the house of lords voted down a targeted action of the bourgeois against Bieberstein. In the following months, there were ever more assemblies, rallies, newspaper articles (especially from outside Nassau), and pamphlets by the different parties of the conflict. Officials who had expressed sympathies for the bourgeois were reprimanded or fired and liberal newspapers from outside Nassau were banned.
In March 1832, there was a new election for the lower chamber. However, the bourgeois deputies demanded that the house of lords were reduced to their previous numbers. Since the government refused this, the deputies ended the session and left the chamber on 17 April. The three ecclesiastical members, the member for teachers and one other deputy declared that the rest had forfeited their right to participate and approved the Ducal tax levy.

Accession of Duke Adolphe[edit]

After the Domain Dispute, the politics of Nassau became quiet. After the death of von Bieberstein, Nassau entered the German Zollverein in 1835, which Bieberstein had energetically resisted. In 1839, Duke William also died and his twenty-two-year-old son Adolphe replaced him as Duke. Adolphe moved his residence to the Wiesbaden City Palace in 1841 and in January 1845, he married the Russian Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna, who died in childbirth a year later. To honour her, he had the Russian orthodox church in Wiesbaden. In 1842, Adolphe was one of the founding members of the Mainz Adelsverein, which was intended to establish a German colony in Texas, but was not successful.
From 1844, there was a wave of community foundations in Nassau, especially trade and athletic associations. These were initially apolitical, but they would play a role in the upcoming Revolution. Wiesbaden was additionally one of the centres of German Catholicism. The government attempted some tentative reforms in 1845 with a somewhat more liberal municipalities law and with a law about district courts in 1846. In 1847, Parliament drafted laws on press freedom and damage to the land by animals, in response to complaints from the rural population about the consequences of Ducal hunts.

Revolution of 1848[edit]
August Hergenhahn in a lithograph, 1848
Like most of Europe, Nassau was engulfed in a revolutionary wave after the February Revolution in France in 1848. On 1 March a liberal group headed by the jurist August Hergenhahn gathered at the Vier Jahreszeiten Hotel in Wiesbaden to present a list of moderate liberal nationalist demands to the government. This list included civil freedoms, a German national assembly, and a new electoral law. The next day, the Neun Forderungen der Nassauer (Nine Demands of the Nassauers) were presented to Chief Minister Emil August von Dungern, who immediately approved the formation of a citizens' militia, freedom of the press, and the convocation of the lower chamber of Parliament to discuss electoral reform. Decisions on the other demands were reserved for the Duke, who was in Berlin at that moment.
In accordance with a proclamation of Hergenhahn, around 40,000 men assembled in Wiesbaden on 4 March. There was a clear conflict in this action, which would shape the subsequent development of events: while the circle around Hergenhahn hoped to receive confirmation of their demands by the acclamation of the people, they were mainly peasants, armed with scythes, cudgels, and axes, seeking the abolition of old Feudal impositions and an easing of forest and hunting laws. As the crowd moved restlessly through the city, the Duke announced from the balcony of his residence that he would meet all their demands. Then the crowd happily dispersed.
With the advent of press freedom, thirteen political newspapers appeared within weeks, including five in Wiesbaden alone. Numerous local gazettes in rural areas also began to print political texts.
From the second week of March, electoral reform took centre stage in the political scene. The most important demand of the liberals was that the right to vote should no longer be tied to a minimum property requirement. On 6 March, the lower chamber held a debate on this subject. When the house of lords sought to discuss voting rights as well, there were protests among the populace of Wiesbaden. Around 500 people gathered in Wiesbaden in the evening to publicly debate the question of voting rights. Smaller meetings occurred in other cities of nassau. By the middle of the month however, these public discussions had faded away. Meanwhile, the lower chamber agreed that the future parliament should be unicameral with 40–60 members and that the property requirement for voting should be abolished. Most controversial was whether the members of the new parliament should be elected directly or by an electoral college. A draft bill was presented on 20 March and finally passed on 28 March. They decided in favour of an electoral college by 18 votes to three. On 5 April the electoral law came into effect. It stated that every hundred people would choose an elector, who in turn would meet in one of 14 electoral colleges, each of which would choose one member of parliament. The right to vote was extended to several groups that had hitherto been excluded, such as noblemen, officials, pensioners, and Jews. Those who received poor relief or were bankrupt were not allowed to vote. All citizens were eligible to serve as members of Parliament except for the highest administrative officials, military officers, and court officials.
Meanwhile, on 31 March, the Pre-Parliament gathered in the St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt-am-Main. Fifteen of its deputies were drawn from the lower chamber of the Nassau parliament and two from the Nassau house of lords. There were another nine citizens of the Duchy in the Pre-Parliament as well.
As a result, chaotic conditions developed in rural areas. Many officials had lost their jobs at the beginning of the revolution, so there was no ordered administration. The farmers completely stopped paying taxes and drove out the forest rangers. Many young officials and teachers proved to be revolutionary agitators for a radical democracy. The Ducal government contributed to this situation with hectic actions to calm the rural population, like amnesties (particularly for poaching, rural, and forest crimes), conceding free elections of the Schultheißen, the abolition of the last feudal dues, and the removal of various unpopular administrative officials. In the cities, the people often reacted to the general lawlessness by establishing their own neighbourhood watches. In Wiesbaden, a central safety committee for the whole of Nassau under the leadership of Augustus Hergenhahn was established and came to enjoy a level of authority throughout the Duchy. Hergenhahn developed into the moderate liberal leading light of the revolution and also secured the trust of Duke Adoplhe. After Emil August von Dungern resigned as Chief Minister, the Duke appointed Hergenhahn as his replacement on 16 April.

1848 elections[edit]
Peter Joseph Blum, Bishop of Limburg (1842–1884)
Since the elections for the Parliament of Nassau were drawing near, political societies began to form and these eventually consolidated into true political parties. From the end of March, the Bishop of Limburg, Peter Joseph Blum [de], began to encourage Catholic societies in rural areas. They had the clearest programme of any of the parties, with 21 core principles, which the Bishop had promulgated on 9 March. Additionally, pastoral letters and religious services provided a platform for propagating ecclesiastical politics. On 4 April, a radical liberal pamphlet was distributed in Wiesbaden, announcing the "Committee of the Republican Society" as the first party that stood against the Catholic political agitation. The next day, a special issue of the Nassauische Allgemein announced a Democratic-Monarchist opposition party, which was formally founded on 7 April. On 5 April, there were significant protests calling for the establishment of a Wiesbaden committee for electoral preparation. In the morning, the Liberals called for a public assembly to take place at 1 pm, at which the electoral college would be chosen for which they had already prepared a list of candidates. In midmorning, the Moderates secured a two hour postponement, which they used to draft their own list, which secured a large majority of the votes when the meeting took place.
In the following weeks, the Ducal government began preparations for the Parliamentary elections and for elections to the Pan-German Frankfurt Parliament. Since this was the first time that such a task had been attempted, it was an incredibly difficult process in many areas to create the lists of voters. There were protests by the populace and newspapers against limitations on the right to vote that were considered unfair. In particular, they pushed back against the fact that the adult sons of artisans and farmers would not be allowed to vote if they worked in their father's business.
Finally, on 18 April, the election of the electoral colleges took place. In each town and region they were chosen by assemblies of voters. The total number of the 420,000 inhabitants of the Duchy who voted could not be determined for certain. Estimates varied between 84,000 and 100,000 people (20–23%). Turnout varied by region from very low to nearly full participation, but there was a tendency for higher participation in the cities than in the countryside. Many procedural irregularities were reported from the electoral assemblies. Ideological programmes played a minor role in the selection of electors. Promises of lower rates of taxation were thrown around in many of the hustings during the assemblies. In most cases they elected people who were already socially prominent, like mayors, teachers, forest rangers, or clergymen (especially in the Westerwald). The Catholics provided their followers with pre-prepared ballot papers with the Catholic candidates marked on them. This was explicitly forbidden by the electoral law and was strongly criticised by the liberals.
The 4,000 electors chose the six representatives of Nassau for the Frankfurt Parliament on 25 April. It proved difficult to find suitable and willing candidates. Only with difficulty did the Wiesbaden electoral committee (as representatives of the moderate liberals, the Catholic church and its societies, and the various ideological newspapers) find candidates for the six vacancies. Everyone in the committee's list was a government employee.

Max von Gagern
In District 1 (Rennerod, in the north of the duchy) and District 4 (Nastätten, southwest), there was not much conflict; Procurator Carl Schenck of Dillenburg was elected in the former with 76% of the vote, while Friedrich Schepp, a member of the governing council, was chosen in the latter with 90% of the vote. In District 2 (Montabaur, in the northwest), there had been a much more heated campaign, but Freiherr Max von Gagern won with 82% of the vote. Von Gagern had been approached to be a candidate by the liberals, but was also a devoted Catholic and close confidant of the Duke. This position between the camps provided opportunities for Catholics and Liberals to attack him, but these attacks ultimately had little impact, since he retained the church's support. Controversy also surrounded Friedrich Schulz, the committee's candidate for District 3 (Limburg, in the centre of the duchy). He was a deputy headmaster in Weilburg and editor of the Lahnboten, who pushed a reformist line, which in his opinion would lead to a Republic. For this ambitious plan, which was criticised as "fantastical", Schulz was criticised by the liberals. But in the end, Schulz secured 85% of the vote in his district. District 5 (Königstein, the southeast) was won by Karl Philipp Hehner, who held the most radical views of any of the representatives. He was a former member of a Burschenschaft  and had been temporarily expelled from state service in 1831 for his political views, but had risen by March 1848 to one of the highest positions in the government. Hehner considered a constitutional monarchy as only a transitional stage and kept his main focus on a Republic. Probably because of this radical position, he secured only 61% of the vote in his district. In District 6 (Wiesbaden), Augustus Hergenhahn himself stood and won with 80% of the vote.
In the course of 1848, the Nassau deputies in the Frankfurt Parliament aside from Schenk developed into factions. Von Gagern, Hergenhahn and Schep joined the moderate liberal Casino faction, while Schulz and Hehner joined the centre left Westendhall. As the Frankfurt Parliament collapsed, Max von Gagern resigned his position along with 65 other monarchist representatives on 21 May 1849. He was followed shortly after by Hergehahn, Schepp and Schenk. Hehner and Schulz remained members until the final dissolution of the Parliament in June 1849.
In the election for the Nassau parliament on 1 May, which was also carried out by the 4,000 members of the electoral colleges, local interests played a much larger role than in the elections for the Frankfurt Parliament. The parties and societies did not have a serious impact. The majority of the successful candidates were civil servants and mayors, with a couple of merchants, industrialists, and farmers. Noticeably few Catholics and absolutely no Catholic clergy were elected.

End of the Revolution[edit]

The Nassau Parliament met for the first time on 22 May 1848. Over the summer, groupings based on the Left-Right schema began to appear in the parliament. The unrest in Nassau was not calmed after the elections. In July 1848, it reached a new crisis point, with physical clashes on the right of the Duke to veto decisions of Parliament. While the left wing in the Parliament did not recognise this power, the right wing and the Ducal government insisted on it. Soon this dispute led to unrest among the general population. Finally, Hergenhahn called in Prussian and Austrian troops from Mainz, who put down the riots in Wiesbaden. In September, after fighting in the streets in Frankfurt, Federal troops occupied part of the Taunus.
In parallel with the Parliament, the landscape of political societies and publications also began to develop a firmer ideological divide and became increasingly active. Many petitions and rallies took place in the second half of the year. The Freie Zeitung became the mouthpiece of the left wing of the National assembly over the course of the summer and frequently criticised the governments of Prussia and Nassau. The Nassauische Allgemeine abandoned strict neutrality and transformed into a supporter of a constitutional monarchy, as did the Weilburg Lahnbote. Even in 1848, an abatement of the revolutionary force was notable. Except for the Freie Zeitung and the Allgemeine all papers ceased publishing in the second half of the year, because sales rapidly dropped and the Ducal government began to suppress the press. As a result of these developments, the Nassauische Allgemeine became increasingly dependent on the Ducal government for money and content. From the end of 1849, there was again a comprehensive censorship regime.
The political societies, which had formed by autumn 1848, mostly took up democratic positions, including explicitly political clubs, but also many sports clubs and workers' clubs. On 12 November, the democratic societies joined together as the Kirberger Union, which was to serve as an umbrella organisation. As the reaction against the revolution began, there were many new foundations, so that by the end of 1848, there were around fifty organisations in the Kirberger Union, many with their own sub-organisations. In the following months however, the democratic movement collapsed rapidly. After the middle of 1849, there were no active democratic societies. A few societies were formed, supporting constitutional monarchy. They gained an over-arching structure on 19 November 1848, when the Nassau and Hessian constitutional societies named themselves the Deutsche Vereine (German Society) as an umbrella organisation with its base in Wiesbaden.

Elections for the Erfurt Parliament[edit]
The Erfurt Union Parliament at St. Augustine's Monastery
After the collapse of the Frankfurt Parliament, there was conflict between Prussia, Austria, and the smaller German states. The Duchy of Nassau was among the small German principalities which supported the Prussians and their plans to convoke a Union Parliament at Erfurt. On 3 December 1849, the Ducal government oversaw elections for this body in the four Nassau districts, using Prussian three-class franchise
Although the political movements had passed their peak, there was even so an electoral campaign for the positions. Constitutionalists, the government and the Nassauische Allgemeine all sought a high voter turnout in the hope that this would add legitimacy to the Prussian plans for a monarchist Germany. The so-called Gotha Post-Parliament, an informal successor of the Frankfurt Parliament, came decisively under the influence of Max van Gagern. August Hergenhahn also participated in that Post-Parliament in June 1849. On 16 December, the constitutional monarchists organised a large electoral assembly in Wiesbaden, at which nominations took place. By contrast, the democrats tried to ensure a low voter turnout and sought the implementation of the Frankfurt Constitution. In June 1849, the organised people's assemblies all over Nassau for this purpose. The largest assembly, with around 500 participants, took place on 10 June in Idstein and formulated ten demands, including the withdrawal of Nassau troops from Baden, Schleswig-Holstein, and the Palatinate, where they were stationed as representatives of the German Federation to prevent revolutionary movements. Beyond that, they wanted the reconstitution of a German parliament with full powers. The Catholic political societies had already disappeared by this point. The church itself made no effort to influence the election.
Preparation for elections to the Erfurt Parliament began in December 1849. On 20 January 1850, the initial election of the electoral college took place in Nassau. Due to the higher voting age, the number of voters participating was a bit lower than in 1848. The turnout varied between 1% and 20%. Only two districts had a turnout of more than 60%. In some places, the only participants were the polling officials themselves. In at least 27 of the 132 electoral districts, the vote could not take place at all because of low turnout and had to be rescheduled for 27 January. The men chosen to be members of the electoral colleges were all civil servants. In the following days, the constitutional monarchists nominated candidates to be elected as representative. On 31 January, the electoral colleges chose Carl Wirth, a local official in Selters, Max von Gagern, August Hergenhahn and the Duke's brother-in-law Hermann, Prince of Wied as Nassau's deputies to the Erfurt Parliament. Although a nobleman, the Prince of Wied was the most liberal of the elected representatives.

The Restoration[edit]
August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, Chief Minister of Nassau (1852–1866)
After a brief period of calm, Duke Adolphe began a reactionary programme. There were ever more conflicts between the Duke and the Chief Minister Friedrich von Wintzingerode [de] who was only moderately conservative and resigned at the end of 1851. His successor was August Ludwig von Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg [de], who took his position on 7 February 1852. With his help, the Duke reduced the freedoms that had been granted over the following years and began to remove liberal officials from office. By the middle of 1852, nearly all political societies had been banned.
In 1849, the government submitted a proposal for new elections to Parliament, which were to elect a bicameral system in which the upper chamber would be elected by wealthy citizens. This proposal was opposed by the Liberals, while the constitutional monarchists supported it. After that there was no further discussion about elections until September 1850, when the government submitted a new proposal for a twenty-four member chamber elected using the Prussian three-class franchise, modelled on the Erfurt Parliament. There was no further consultation with Parliament about the new elections, since the Duke dissolved Parliament on 2 April 1851. On 25 November, the Duke finally brought regulations into effect for the election of a Parliament similar to the bicameral system that existed before 1848. The political groups and the few remaining societies made no attempt at campaigning. On 14 and 16 February 1852 the landowners and merchants in the highest tax-bracket (less than a hundred people in the whole duchy) voted first for the six members of the upper chamber. The electoral college for the lower house was elected on 9 February and the elected college met on 18 February. The eligible voters for the lower chamber numbered 70,490. Voter turnout was between 3–4%. In some areas, lack of interest meant that the elections could not take place at all. Unlike the previous Parliament, farmers were the largest group in the new lower house.

Marienstatt Abbey
Bitter political strife returned once more in 1864, when the Government made plans to sell Marienstatt Abbey in the Westerwald. It had been secularised in 1803 and passed into private ownership. In 1841 the site was put up for sale and the government made plans to turn the abbey into the first state-run home for the elderly and poor in Nassau. The Minister of Construction estimated the costs for the required renovations at 34,000 guilders. In 1842, the Duchy bought the Abbey for 19,500 guilders. Shortly after that it was reported the buildings were in too bad a condition for the project.  By the 1860s, the buildings had declined even further. The diocese of Limburg began to be interested in acquiring it, in order to make it into an orphanage. The government was also interested in selling it because of the costs of maintaining the unused complex. The abbey was sold on 18 May 1864 for 20,900 guilders.
Shortly before this, in the 25 November 1863 elections, the liberals had won a large majority in the lower chamber of Parliament. Their manifesto had proposed, among other things, that the privileges held by the Catholic church should also be extended to other religious groups. On 9 June 1864, the liberals in parliament argued that the sale of the Abbey should not be completed. They argued that the buildings and estate were worth more than the price that they had been sold for, and that Parliament had a right to veto sales of land. The government's officials denied that Parliament had any such right and stressed the social value that the structure would have after its sale. In the course of the debate, which continued over several sittings, a fierce war of words developed between the pro- and anti-clerical members of Parliament. The anti-clerical members disapproved of giving the Catholic church oversight of children. In the end, the sale went ahead despite Parliament's opposition.

End of the Duchy[edit]
When the Austro-Prussian War broke out on 14 June 1866, the Duchy of Nassau took the side of Austria. The war was won at the Battle of Königgrätz on 3 July and the "victory" of Nassau over Prussia at the Battle of Zorn near Wiesbaden on 12 July 1866 did nothing to prevent the annexation [de] of Nassau by Prussia. Nassau become the Wiesbaden Region into the Province of Hesse-Nassau.[citation needed]
Before the conclusion of the Prague Peace on 23 August 1866 and two days before the creation of the North German Confederation, on 16 August 1866, the king announced to both houses of the Landtag of Prussia that Prussia would annex Hannover, Hesse-Kassel, the city of Frankfurt, and Nassau. Both houses were asked to give their assent to a law bringing the Prussian constitution into force in those territories on 1 October 1867.[3] The law was passed by both houses of the Prussian Landtag on 20 September 1866 and was published in the gazette. The next step was the publication of the notice of annexation, which made the citizens of the nine annexed regions into citizens of Prussia. After these official actions, further practical actions were taken to bring the annexed regions into full union with the rest of Prussia.[4]
Duke Adolphe, the last Duke of Nassau, received 15,000,000 guilders as compensation, as well as Biebrich Palace, Schloss Weilburg, Jagdschloss Platte [de] and Luxemburgisches Schloss in Königstein. He became Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1890 after the male line of Orange-Nassau became extinct.[5]
In 1868, Nassau, along with Frankfurt and the Electorate of Hesse were united in the new Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau. The capital of the new province was Kassel, which had previously been the capital of the Electorate of Hesse. Nassau and Frankfurt became the administrative region of Wiesbaden. In 1945, the majority of the old Duchy of Nassau fell within the American occupation zone and became part of the state of Hesse. Wiesbaden remained an administrative region within Hesse until 1968, when it was incorporated into Darmstadt. A small part of the Duchy of Nassau fell within the French occupation zone and became the administrative region of Montabaur in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. In 1956, a referendum on joining the state of Hesse was rejected by voters.[6]

Politics[edit]
Foreign affairs[edit]
In foreign affairs, the Duchy's geographic location and economic weakness greatly limited its room to manoeuvre – in the Napoleonic period, it had no autonomy at all. The Nassau 'army' was at the beck and call of Napoleon. In 1806, they were stationed as occupation troops in Berlin. Then three battalions were stationed at the Siege of Kolberg. Two regiments of infantry and two cavalry squadrons fought for more than five years in the Peninsular war; only half of them came back. In November 1813, Nassau joined the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon.
Nassau troops fought at the battle of Waterloo: 1/2 rgt. was part of the crew of the fortified Hougemont farm which hold out against Napoleon, 1/1 rgt. was heavily battered after the French taking of La Haye Sainte. Of 7507 men inc. volunteers, 887 were killed in action.
After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Nassau was a member of the German Confederation.

Military[edit]
Nassau's military policy was shaped by Duchy's membership of the German Confederation. Like the rest of the administration, the military was reformed in order to unite the various military forces inherited from Nassau's predecessor states into a single body.
The majority of the troops consisted of two regiments of infantry, created in 1808/09. During the Napoleonic Wars, these were supported by squadrons of Jäger. After the Battle of Waterloo, the Duchy raised an artillery company, which became an artillery division with two companies in it after 1833. Further units were added (pioneers, Jägers, baggage trains, reserves). Further contingents were added as required during wartime. The whole military was placed under a brigade command structure. At its head was the Duke, but day-to-day operations were organised by an Adjutant general. Ordinarily, the Nassau army contained roughly 4,000 soldiers.
After the annexation of the Duchy, most of the officers and soldiers joined the Prussian Army.

Education[edit]
The Duchy could not afford its own university, so Duke William I made a treaty with the Kingdom of Hannover, which allowed citizens of Nassau to study at the University of Göttingen. In order to finance schools and university scholarships, on 29 March 1817, Duke William established the Nassau Central Study Fund, which still exists today, by consolidating a number of older secular and religious funds, and endowed it with farmland, forests, and bonds.
In Göttingen, non-Nassau students occasionally participated illicitly in a free dinner funded by the Central Study Fund. The German term nassauer, meaning 'someone who partakes of a privilege they are not entitled to' is said to derive from this practice, although etymologists report that the word is actually a Berlin dialect term derived from Rotwelsch Yiddish and that this story was invented after the fact.

Religion[edit]
Map of majority religions in Nassau (1816–1866)
As a result of the disparate territories that were joined together to form the Duchy, Nassau was not a religiously unified state. In 1820, the breakdown of religious groups was: 53% United Protestant, 45% Catholic, 1.7% Jewish, and 0.06% Mennonite. However, settlements with more than one religion were unusual. Most villages and cities were clearly dominated by the members of one of the two major Christian groups. As was common in Protestant parts of Germany, the constitution placed the church under state control. The Lutheran and Reformed churches agreed to unite into the single Protestant Church in Nassau in 1817, at the Unionskirche in Idstein, making it the first united Protestant church in the German Confederation.
Even in 1804 there was an effort to establish a Catholic diocese of Nassau, but it was only in 1821 that the Duchy of Nassau and the Holy See came to an agreement on the establishment of the diocese of Limburg, which was formally established in 1827.
Alongside the actual church policy, there were other points of interaction between state politics and ecclesiastical matters. The relocation of a religious society, the order of the Redemptorists, to Bornhofen led to conflict between the state and the Bishop. The Redemptorists stayed in Bornhofen. The Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, founded in Dernbach were another religious society, which soon took charge of care for the sick within the diocese. After some initial problems at lower levels, they were tolerated by the government of the Duchy and even tacitly supported, because they had received enthusiastic commendation by doctors. In many places 'hospitals' or mobile medical stations were established, the fore-runners of modern Sozialstationen [de].

Economy[edit]
The economic situation of the small Duchy was precarious. The majority of the land area of the country was Mittelgebirge, which had little agricultural value and represented a substantial barrier to internal transport. Even so, more than a third of the population worked on their own farmland, which was broken up into small areas as a result of partible inheritance. This smallholdings generally had to supplement their income from other sources – often in the Westerwald, this was by service as a peddler. Among tradesmen, the overwhelming majority were artisans.

Currency[edit]
The Duchy belonged the south German currency area. The most important denomination was therefore the guilder. This was minted for use as currency money. Up to 1837, there were 24 guilders to the Cologne silver marks (233.856 grammes). The guilder was divided into 60 kreutzer. Small change was minted in silver and copper, at 6, 3, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 grammes.[7]

From 1816, there were also Kronenthaler of 162 kreutzer (i.e. 2.7 guilders). Between 1816 and 1828, the mint of the Duchy was located in buildings in Limburg, which are now the Bishop's curia. From 1837, the Duchy was one of the members of the Munich Currency Treaty, which set the silver mark (233.855 g) at 24.5 guilders. After the conclusion of the Dresden Coinage Convention in 1838, the Thaler was also legal tender and was minted in small quantities. Two dollars were equivalent to 3.5 guilders. In 1842, the Heller, valued at a quarter of a kreutzer, was introduced as the smallest denomination. After the Vienna Currency Treaty of 1857, the Duchy also minted the Vereinsthaler. A Pfund (500 g) of silver was equivalent to 52.5 guilder or 30 taler. The Heller was replaced by the Pfennige, also worth a quarter of a Kreutzer.
Banknotes, known as Landes-Credit-Casse-Scheine were produced at Wiesbaden by the Landes-Credit-Casse from 1840. They had a face value of one, five, ten, and twenty-five guilders.

Bernard Descôteaux OQ ChOM (French: [bɛʁnaʁ dekoto]; 1947 – 13 January 2024) was a Canadian journalist. He was the editor-in-chief and director of the Montreal-based newspaper Le Devoir from 1999 through 2016.[1][2] In a career spanning over four decades, he covered Montreal's municipal politics and parliamentary reporting from Ottawa and Quebec City. Descôteaux was made an officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2010 and received the National Assembly medal of honour in 2017.


Early life[edit]
Bernard Descôteaux was born in Nicolet, Quebec[a] in 1947.[1][4] He graduated with a degree in political science from the Université de Montréal and followed it with a degree in politics and economics from the University of Toronto as the Southam Foundation scholar at Massey College.[1][4]

Career[edit]
Descôteaux started his career in 1969 as a reporter with La Voix de l'Est, a French-language daily, before moving to the Montreal-based Le Devoir newspaper in 1974.[4] He started with the newspaper as a parliament correspondent. He grew through the ranks and served as the newspaper's editor-in-chief and later as the managing editor and director from 1999 to 2016, succeeding Lise Bissonnette.[1][5][6] In a career spanning over four decades, he covered Montreal's municipal politics and parliamentary reporting from Ottawa and Quebec City.[7]
Descôteaux is credited with the economic revival of the Le Devoir newspaper.[4] Under his leadership, the newspaper recorded profits and increased its circulation, in contrast to much of the rest of the sector. Descôteaux also developed the presence of the newspaper on the Internet.[4] As he ended his career with the newspaper, the industry again saw declines in revenues, in particular advertising revenues. During this time he called for more governmental support for the Canadian media sector and also spoke against the large portion of the revenues going to large technology platforms.[8][9]
Descôteaux was made an officer of the National Order of Quebec in 2010 and received the National Assembly medal of honour in 2017.[1][7][10] He was also a recipient of the Order of Montreal.[9] He served on the board of directors of the Ensemble contemporain de Montréal [fr], a Montreal-based musical academy, the Centre d'études sur les médias, a center for media studies at the Université Laval, and Génération d'idées, a think tank.[7]

Personal life[edit]
Descôteaux was married to Marie Lavigne. The couple had two children.[11]
Descôteaux died on 13 January 2024 at age 77.[12] He had been diagnosed with cancer earlier.[1]

The 2021–22 Scottish League Cup final was an association football match that took place at Hampden Park, Glasgow on 19 December 2021.[1] It was the final match of the 2021–22 Scottish League Cup, the 76th season of the Scottish League Cup (known as the Premier Sports Cup for sponsorship reasons), a competition for the 42 teams in the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). Three-time winners Hibernian met then-19-time winners Celtic after winning their respective semi-finals; Hibs defeating reigning league champions Rangers and Celtic overcoming the League Cup and Scottish Cup holders St Johnstone.[2][3]
It was the 36th appearance in a League Cup final for Celtic and the 11th for Hibernian. It was also the fourth meeting of these clubs in a League Cup final, with Celtic having won in 1969 and 1974, and Hibs having won in 1972.


Match[edit]
Summary[edit]
Celtic largely controlled the first forty-five minutes, playing mostly within Hibernian's half with the majority of possession, however, failed to create chances that tested Matt Macey, bar a single shot on target by Greg Taylor.[4]
On a rare forward venture, Hibernian scored off a corner-kick with their first shot on target in the 51st minute, as their captain Paul Hanlon headered the ball just beyond the goal-line. Celtic responded directly from kick-off, with captain Callum McGregor providing a through ball to Kyogo Furuhashi who slotted it into the bottom left corner. The Japanese forward collected his second of the match in the 72nd minute with a composed chip over Macey after a quickly taken free-kick by Tom Rogic. This goal would prove to be the winner, along with a 96th-minute save from Celtic goalkeeper Joe Hart, ensuring Celtic's 20th League Cup title.[5]

^ Lika kept a clean-sheet for 72 minutes in the 2–1 win over Tomori Berat before he was replaced due to injury. The opposition scored later in the game with Lika no longer on field. His clean sheet is not included in overall statistics.

^ Alessio Abibi kept a clean sheet on the same match as Ilion Lika. They both appeared in the 6–0 home win over Pogradeci on 17 December 2017. So both clean sheets are counted.

^ Ditmar Shehri kept a clean sheet on the same match as Ilion Lika. They both appeared in the 3–0 home win over Naftëtari Kuçovë on 30 September 2017. So both clean sheets are counted.

Blockeley is a Minecraft server created by students of the University of California, Berkeley, which is a 1:1 scale[clarification needed] reconstruction of the university campus.[1][2]
The project was headed by student Bjorn Lustic who got the idea from a sarcastic Facebook comment;[3] as the project grew more than 500 students applied to help build the server. Growing from the initial plan of building Memorial Stadium, Lustic and his team would go on to work on the rest of the university.[4]
The server was used by the university to host the 2020 and 2021 UC Berkeley graduation ceremonies during the COVID-19 pandemic.[5][6][7] The server hosted a music festival presented by Beauz and produced by their artist manager Antonio Di Puorto and his team. The two-day event included guest performances by Cash Cash, Sam Feldt, and Vini Vici and 60 more artists.[5][2]
The Associated Students of the University of California has worked in collaboration with the building team to continue to host events on the server during the continued COVID-19 pandemic.[8]


History[edit]
The project officially began on March 15, 2020, shortly after the university closed the campus and halted all in-person activities. Bjorn Lustic with the help of friend, Hunter Hall, converted a NASA topography scan of Berkeley into a Minecraft world using world editing tool. The process of recreating the California Memorial Stadium was completed much quicker than they had expected due to each member's familiarity of the stadium. Future building co-lead and commencement coordinator, Nicholas Pickett, recalls spending much time on the northwest entrance of the stadium as a University of California Marching Band member, while future executive director, Elliot Choi, recalled his time setting up card stunts in the student section as a freshman in the University of California Rally Committee.[9] Choi also suggested the name change to Blockeley, a play on the city's name, Berkeley, to avoid potential legal conflicts with the use of the university's name.

Building the campus[edit]
Finishing the stadium in just about a week, the team moved on to building the surrounding areas such as the International House Berkeley using tools such as Google Earth to get approximate dimensions of the buildings. Merely being a team of about seven active builders working in their free time, there were no plans to complete the entire campus, until building team member, Evan Quan, posted a public call for builders on the popular "Overheard at UC Berkeley" Facebook page. Overnight, the team's Discord server grew from roughly 10 members to over a thousand with hundreds of students applying to build through a publicly shared Google Form.[10]

Blockeley Music Festival[edit]
Blockeley Music Festival was a two-day event. It started on May 16, 2020, and included guest performances by more than 60 artists including Cash Cash, Sam Feldt, and Vini Vici. The project began on May 1, when Elliot Choi proposed the idea to Johan Yang from Beauz. Together with their management team composed by Antonio Di Puorto, Luigi Porcari and Alessandro Dimitrio they took charge of the project and started what it would become a two-week marathon to deliver the full lineup and branding for the festival. The event was produced by the artist management agency KEYTEM and the New York-based OS Studios.[11] The event was sponsored by Razer Inc., NVIDIA, Spin, NRG Esports and UC Berkeley's Cal Esports.[12] Blockeley was the first music festival hosted on Minecraft.[13]

Listed Building – Grade II
Location of Hannington Hall in Wiltshire
Hannington Hall is a Grade II* listed country house in the village of Hannington, Wiltshire, England.
The house was built in 1653 by the Freke family, who had bought the estate in 1605, and possibly incorporates parts of a previous parsonage. The east front is of two and a half storeys in five bays, made of rubble with ashlar dressings. An orangery was added in 1836 and a service wing in 1863. An inscription below the front parapet celebrates the brotherly love of Raufe and William Freke, the sons of Sir Thomas Freke, the original owner.[1] The house has twenty rooms and stands in 340 acres of pasture and woodland.[2]
Associated buildings such as the stable block, a well house, an ice house, and the street wall and gate piers are all Grade II listed structures.[3]
The Hall passed down in the Freke family via Thomas Freke (1660–1721) MP, his Socinian writer brother William Freke, and the Hussey-Freke family.
During the Second World War it was occupied by the female Auxiliary Units' Special Duties Section, known as the "Secret Sweeties", under the command of Senior Commander Beatrice Temple, which was to form part of the British resistance movement in the event of a German invasion.
GWR Hall class locomotive No 5930 was named after the hall.

Greenply Industries Limited (Greenply), is among India’s largest interior infrastructure brands, headquartered in Kolkata, West Bengal.[1] The company has established a strong foothold with over 30 years of experience in manufacturing and marketing a comprehensive range of plywood, blockboards, decorative veneers, flush doors, and other allied products. The company is listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange.[2] Greenply commands a 26% market share of India's organised plywood market. The company has a strong leadership presence with 55 branches (including virtual branches) and 7,500+ channel partners across India. With state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in West Bengal, Nagaland & Gujarat, and overseas manufacturing units in Gabon (West Africa) & Myanmar, Greenply is making its presence felt across the globe.[3] [4]


History[edit]
Spearheaded by Mr. Rajesh Mittal, the company saw its initial developments from a saw-mill in 1984 to a plywood manufacturing plant in Nagaland in the year 1988. It was on the 28th of November, 1990, that the company was incorporated as "Mittal Laminates Private Limited". 
There was an amalgamation between Greenply Industries and Mittal Laminates Limited on April 1, 1994. Later in 1996, the organization was renamed as Greenply Industries Ltd and the flagship brand of Greenply was launched in 1997.  
There were other significant developments that took place as well. The brand Optima was launched in 2008 while 2011 witnessed the launch of brand Ecotec in the economy segment. 2001 observed the launch of Green Club - a premium-grade plywood that introduced 300% lifetime warranty (a first in the industry).
However, very recently in 2019-20, the premium portfolio segment of plywood consisting of Green Club Plus 700, Green Club 5 Hundred and Green Platinum was upgraded and improved (with new features & warranty terms) to meet the increasing requirement of safe & healthy homes. India’s first zero-emission (E-0) plywood, Green Club Plus 700,[5][6][7] was launched in 2020.

Chairman Cum Managing Director[edit]
Rajesh Mittal,[8] the Managing Director of Greenply Industries Limited (GIL), is popularly known as the plywood manufacturing baron of India, and there are legitimate reasons behind giving this influential personality the name. With a leadership foresight and strategic management, Rajesh Mittal has carved out an unprecedented growth path for Greenply. Since 1984, he has been working towards spreading the company’s wings in different pockets of India and abroad including Myanmar and Gabon, Africa. Today, Greenply enjoys the largest market share amongst the organized players along with the title of India’s No.1 manufacturer offering a comprehensive range of plywood, blockboard, decorative veneer, flush door, PVC board & doors as well as other specialized application products.

Joint Managing Director[edit]
Sanidhya Mittal[edit]
With a firm vision of making Greenply a brand leader in its category as well as one of the best places to work, Mr Sanidhya Mittal’s [9] involvement in Greenply Industries Limited dates back to the year 2012 when he decided to direct his efforts at the grassroot level of the enterprise. He learnt about the manufacturing process and technical features of products when he focused on the factory floor. He also joined the Head Office a year later to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals. In 2017, he took on the mantle of the business.[10]

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Frisian_battles&oldid=1182029910"Sydney Bourne (c. 1857- 1930[1]) was the first chairman of Crystal Palace F.C.
Bourne was a local football enthusiast who joined the board of Crystal Palace at the invitation of Edmund Goodman. Goodman had stumbled upon Bourne's name after searching the records of FA Cup Final ticket sales. Noting that Bourne was a regular purchaser of tickets, Goodman approached him regarding the idea of a new club playing at the FA Cup Final venue. Bourne was very agreeable to the idea and joined the board of directors, being elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting.[2]
In 1909, Bourne was quoted in the press on the idea circulating at the time of the football players forming a trade union.  Bourne wished to place a Director's view of the idea on the public record, and noted: "nine out of ten clubs  in England are insolvent, and are only kept alive by the personal sacrifices of their directors. If trade unionism is going to step in and interfere in every petty dispute there is not a director who will risk another shilling or devote another hour's work for the sport. Club directors have no objection to players forming a union of their own on fair and proper lines, but they are unanimously determined that any federation of players must work with their employers, and not against them, as the present players' union would do."[3]  Bourne also oversaw the purchase of the land for the building of the club's stadium, Selhurst Park.[4]

Loose Ends (2001) is the first original novel based on the Roswell TV series.


Plot summary[edit]
It started out as an innocent road trip to Carlsbad Caverns to unwind, but now Max, Isabel, Michael, Liz, and Maria are totally regretting their plan. Hundreds of feet underground, in the cavern gift shop, Liz turns and is stunned to see someone she thought she'd never meet again—the man who shot her long ago in the diner. Their eyes meet and Liz bolts. But running won't solve the group's new "problem." Because the shooter has recognized Liz. Now he wants her dead. And nobody knows why.

Reception[edit]
Don D'Amassa said in his review for Science Fiction Chronicle that "Cox does a craftsman like job of elaborating this minor theme and turning it into a reasonably good adventure."[1]

Trivia[edit]
A large part of this book concerns a day trip to a real New Mexico attraction, the Carlsbad Caverns.

The station is named after Vine Street, which today acts as frontage roads along Interstate 676 and nearby Race Street, although the given address is closer to westbound Vine than Race. This stop is also used as the official stop for the Pennsylvania Convention Center on the Broad Street Line; signs will direct passengers to the appropriate exits. However, riding the Broad Street Line one stop further south to City Hall and then connecting to the Market–Frankford Line East toward Frankford and then exiting at 11th Street station will bring passengers right inside the Pennsylvania Convention Center and the Fashion District.
In addition to the Convention Center and other sights on the westernmost edge of Chinatown, the Race–Vine station serves several office buildings, including Thomas Jefferson University, the Parkway Museum District, Roman Catholic High School, and Drexel University's School of Nursing.
Passengers may connect to SEPTA City Bus Routes 4, 16, and 27 here, in addition to a number of NJ Transit bus routes, which board on the northeast corner of Broad and Vine Streets. Until the mid-1990s, there was a concourse leading up Broad Street from City Hall to the Race Street side of the station.

The IBM ThinkPad 380 was a notebook computer series released May 13, 1997 by IBM as part of their ThinkPad laptop series. Notable for incorporating a CD-ROM and a floppy drive,[1] it was considered a mid-range laptop by IBM at the time, and sold well.[2] The series was the successor to the IBM ThinkPad 365.


Features[edit]
The 380 shipped with Windows 95, but they were capable of running Windows 3.11, Windows NT, OS/2 Warp,[3] Windows 98, Windows Me, Red Hat Linux, as well as various other Linux distributions. Originally, there were two models; the base ThinkPad 380 and the ThinkPad 380D, which was equipped with a CD-ROM drive. The 380 came with an Intel Pentium processor running at 150 MHz with or without the optional MMX feature. With only 16 MB of base RAM included and a base hard drive only 1.08 GB in size, Windows 3.11 was a better operating system choice for the base model; however, with 32 MB installed it could run Windows 95 properly.

Models and features[edit]
IBM ThinkPad 380E — The 380E model introduced several additional features, along with more optional features available. Along with the 16 MB soldered onto the motherboard (a feature carried over from the original 380 model), a single slot accessible through an external cover on the bottom of the case could hold a memory card up to 64 MB in size, allowing a maximum of 80 MB to be installed. Other features included: an internal 56k modem option, and a choice between the base 150 MHz processor or a modestly improved 166 MHz processor, both of which now integrated MMX from Intel as a standard feature.
IBM ThinkPad 380ED — The 380ED model was virtually identical to the 380E, but with the 166 MHz processor standard, a .3 lb (0.1 kg) increase in weight, an optional 2.5-hour battery along with the model standard two-hour version, and a gradual increase in hard drive size from 2.1 to 3.2 GB, and then to 5.1 GB (which became optional for the older models).
IBM ThinkPad 380XD — The 380XD model introduced the 233 MHz Pentium processor with MMX, and included 32 MB on the motherboard instead of 16 MB, increasing the memory limit to 96 MB (it unofficially supports up to 160 MB with the use of a 128 MB EDO 144-pin SODIMM). It introduced features such as a USB port, the ability for the customer to replace the hard drive (something that was usually only doable by the factory in the older models), hard drive options from the base 3.2 GB drive to 4 GB or 6.4 GB, the latter of which available only to the 380XD and 380Z (at least from the factory), and an optional 266 MHz processor upgrade.
IBM ThinkPad 380Z — The 380Z was the last model of the 380 series to be produced. It introduced the optional 300 MHz Pentium II mobile processor into the line, and included advanced features such as a S.M.A.R.T. hard drive, a larger 13.3 in (340 mm) TFT LCD screen with a maximum resolution of 1024x768 (compared to the 12.1 in (310 mm), 800x600 maximum on the older models), ACPI support, the integration of higher-quality speakers with the addition of an internal sub-woofer, and its own port replicator that would only work with the 380Z.
All the models—apart from the base 380—could run versions of Windows up to and including Windows XP. For Windows XP to run smoothly, however, they would need to be configured with at least 64 MB of RAM and a 2.0 GB hard drive or larger.

Phapitreron leucotis(Temminck, 1823)


The white-eared brown dove (Phapitreron leucotis) is a species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is endemic to the Philippines, and is most commonly found in lowland and montane forests.[2]

Description[edit]
Adult individuals have a black sub-ocular line starting from the gape to the nape (McGregor, 1909) followed by a white line from the posterior border of the eye to the nape (Carino, 2009; McGregor, 1909). In general, these birds have brown feathers but the crown is pale gray and the chin and upper throat is tawny (Baptista et al., 2017). In addition, lower breast and abdomen are slightly pale yellow which is much paler than the posterior part, the under tail-coverts are dark pearl-gray and the wings are brown with the primaries having pale edges, and the rectrices each having a wide gray band on the terminal end (McGregor, 1909). These birds are also characterized by short bills (Carino, 2009; Hachisuka, 1941), and greenish bronze collar (Carino, 2009; McGregor, 1909) or green or blue iridescence on the nape (P. Simpson, pers. Commun., September 11, 2017).

PGDS protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the HPGDS gene.[5][6][7][8]
Prostaglandin-D synthase is a sigma class glutathione-S-transferase family member. The enzyme catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to PGD2 and plays a role in the production of prostanoids in the immune system and mast cells. The presence of this enzyme can be used to identify the differentiation stage of human megakaryocytes.[8]

Benjamin "Ben" C. Stark is an American biologist and a professor at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He grew up in a small city in mid-Michigan in the 1950s-1960s. After high school he majored in cellular biology at the University of Michigan (B.S. 1971) and later he received his master (M.Sc. 1974) and doctoral (Ph.D. 1977) degrees from Yale University with Sidney Altman. After two postdoctoral positions, he took a faculty position at Illinois Institute of Technology, where he has worked since. He has carried out research in the area of genetic engineering and RNA biology.
He was one of the co-discoverers of RNase P,[1] a catalytic RNA, in the laboratory of Sidney Altman who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Thomas R. Cech in 1989 for their work on the catalytic properties of RNA. Other major accomplishment of Stark includes the discovery of enhancement of productivity of recombinant organisms engineered to express the Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb (hemoglobin)),[2] the first bacterial hemoglobin. He has over 80 peer-reviewed publications.

Awards and honors[edit]
Stark's research has been recognized by many awards, including Honor Award for University Research by the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (2013), Person of the Millennium (IIT Millennium Project, 1999), and the Teaching Excellence Award (Lewis College, IIT, 1988).

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dying_Days&oldid=1187413480"Super Queeroes is a Canadian multimedia web project, which launched in 2019 on CBC Arts. Created as a Pride Month project to mark the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the project featured LGBTQ Canadians creating short video, essay or art projects in tribute to another influential LGBTQ Canadian trailblazer.[1] It was conceived by writer and producer Peter Knegt.
The project selected a total of 69 honorees because Stonewall had taken place in 1969; seven of the honorees were duos or groups, but were counted as a single honoree because they were being named collectively rather than as individuals.
The project won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Interactive Production at the 8th Canadian Screen Awards in 2020.[2]

In military terms, a Lieutenants Protection Association (sometimes also called a "Lieutenants Protection Agency" or "LPA") is an informal group of junior officers.  Many young officers find the Lieutenant Protection Association/Agency community is the best way to make an impact and a successful start to their military career once in the fleet.
Depending the unit, the LPA may base membership on being a "one bar," and include Warrant Officers.

Honorary membership[edit]
Unit LPAs may extend honorary membership, or limited membership, to servicemembers of other ranks. These individuals will be included based on vague, subjective qualifications.

The Edsel Roundup is a station wagon that was produced and sold by Edsel in 1958. Like the Villager and Bermuda station wagons, the Roundup was built on a 116-inch (2,946 mm) wheelbase[1] shared with Ford's station wagons, as well as core body stampings. It had an approach angle of 21° and an overall length of 205.42 in.[2]
The Roundup represented the base trim level available within the Edsel brand for a station wagon, and was only available during Edsel's introductory year of 1958.  The Roundup was available only as a six-passenger two-door station wagon.[3]  The Roundup came with black rubber flooring,[1] armrests, front and rear ashtrays, dome and courtesy lights, and a white vinyl headliner. A split-back front seat was standard to allow access to the back seat. In place of roll-down rear windows, the Roundup used sliding windows.
To further separate the Roundup from the Ford Ranch Wagon on which it was based, the Roundup received Edsel's front fascia and grille assembly, as well as unique boomerang-shaped taillights. The shape of the taillights posed a problem when used as turn indicators – the left hand taillight appeared as an arrow pointing right and vice versa from a distance.
All station wagons shared the Edsel Ranger's engine availability, with a 361 cubic inch V8 as standard, as was a three-speed manual transmission. Buyers also had the option of a three-speed automatic transmission with a standard column-mounted gear selector, or could choose Edsel's highly promoted but trouble-prone Teletouch automatic, which placed its drive-selection buttons in the steering wheel hub.
While their roll-out was highly publicized in the fall of 1957, Edsels were a marketing disaster for Ford. Total output for the Roundup stood at 963 units. The low output number could be attributed to the declining popularity of two-door wagons in the American market and the Edsel's overall lack of consumer appeal.
For the 1959 model year, the Roundup and the premium Bermuda station wagons were dropped, leaving the mid-value Villager as Edsel's sole station wagon model.

Jurassic Park III: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a score of the 2001 film of the same name. It was orchestrated, composed and conducted by Don Davis and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony. Davis incorporated John Williams' themes from the previous films into the score.


Background and composition[edit]
John Williams had previously composed the film soundtracks Jurassic Park (1993) and The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997). As Jurassic Park III was underway, Williams was busy working on the A.I. Artificial Intelligence soundtrack and suggested Don Davis to handle the Jurassic Park III score. According to Davis: "I suspect he wasn't too interested in doing the third part of a franchise that he said goodbye to sometime before". Despite a rumor, James Horner was never considered to compose the film's score.[1][2]
After signing on to the project, Davis became unsure if his score could live up to Williams' work.[3][4] He listened to the previous Jurassic Park scores, hoping for his own to maintain consistency with them. Some of Williams' prior themes, mostly from the first film, were used in Jurassic Park III, but some were shortened or lengthened to fit certain scenes.[1][2][3][4] Williams provided his original handwritten scores to Davis.[2] One of Williams' themes is used for the returning character of Dr. Alan Grant.[2][3][5] Davis also composed a new theme which was supposed to recreate the mending relationship between Paul and Amanda Kirby.[2][4]
The score was recorded with a 104-piece orchestra, with Davis orchestrating and conducting.[1] One track, "Clash of Extinction", was created for a battle scene between a T. rex and Spinosaurus, although Johnston ultimately removed the track.[1][5]
Aside from Davis' score, Johnston chose to include "Big Hat, No Cattle", a song by Randy Newman from his 1999 album Bad Love.[3][5]

A promotional release of the score was gifted to friends of Don Davis and includes nearly the entire score. The promotional score's mix is narrow because of a direct downmix from the original 5.1 masters, without any correction or remixing for stereo performance.[6]
