Frederic Antes Godcharles (June 3, 1872 – December 30, 1944) was a Pennsylvania politician, historian and author, who served as soldier and as director of the State Library of Pennsylvania and State Museum of Pennsylvania.


Personal life[edit]
Godcharles was born on June 3, 1872, in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, the first of five children of Elizabeth (born Burkenbine) and Charles Aiken Godcharles. His four younger siblings were Mary, Charles, Walter, and Elizabeth (the last three were born in Milton, Pennsylvania).[1][2] He married Mary Walls Barber (1880–1952) in Washington, D.C., on June 15, 1904. They had no children.[2]
He graduated from Lafayette College with an electrical engineering degree in 1893.[3] Godcharles was an avid trap shooter and placed fourth in a professional-amateur shoot.[4] He and his wife moved to Maryland after his term as Director of the Pennsylvania State Library and Museum, and died in Leonardtown there after a brief illness, aged 72.[1]

Public service[edit]
Godcharles was a member of the U.S. Army in the Spanish–American War in 1898. He served in the Army again during the First World War,[5] and rose to the rank of captain.[4][6]
Godcharles was a member of the Republican Party and served in both houses of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. Godcharles represented Northumberland County in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1901 and 1902,[7] and represented Union County in the Pennsylvania State Senate from 1905 to 1908.[8] Other sources differ as to his service in the General Assembly: his obituary in The New York Times said he served in the "General Assembly in 1900 and the Pennsylvania Senate from 1904 to 1908",[1] while The Political Graveyard says he was a member of the "Pennsylvania state senate, 1905-08" and a member of the Pennsylvania delegation to the 1908 Republican National Convention,[5] and the book Union County, Pennsylvania: A Celebration of History lists him as representing Union County, Pennsylvania, in the state senate from 1909 to 1912.[9]
In 1920 Godcharles was living in Milton, Pennsylvania working as the editor of a weekly newspaper.[2] He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for the office of Secretary of Internal Affairs in 1926,[10] and was mentioned as a probable nominee for the same office in 1930.[11]

State librarian and museum director[edit]
Godcharles served as Pennsylvania State Librarian and Director of the State Museum of Pennsylvania from 1927 to 1931.[12][13] He had numerous duties outside the state library and museum. For example, in 1928 Godcharles presided at the dedication of a new museum at the birthplace of Henry Clay Frick in Scottdale, Pennsylvania.[14] He served as the official representative for Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and featured speaker at a Flag Day parade and ceremony in New York City in 1929.[15] In 1930 Godcharles was a founding member of the "Society for Pennsylvania Archeology" (SPA) and was elected to its executive board.[13]
The State Museum of Pennsylvania had been founded in 1905, and at the time of his appointment the state librarian was also director of the museum. Godcharles wrote in 1927 that "the Museum was at a standstill. Nothing of importance had been done in this division, nor anything of value added for some years. He sought extra funding and received a budget increase to increase the museum staff to a total of nine, however the state legislature hampered his efforts by requiring over $11,000 of the budget be kept as a reserve fund instead. It also did not appropriate any additional funds to acquire more "specimens and artifacts".[13] Despite these limitations, 1928 was a record-breaking year for school visits at the museum. In 1929 there were over 20,000 total visitors to the museum and the American Association of Museums ranked it as one of the top sixteen in the United States.[13]
Godcharles' tenure coincided with the beginning of the Great Depression and the state library and museum budget were cut repeatedly as a result. These and staff cuts led him to write "We have not 'sold' our enterprise to the Legislature or to others who hold the public purse strings. They do appreciate the educational importance of the work proposed. It is for us to educate them."[13] He resigned in 1931, but remained active in the SPA, serving as its president in 1933.[13] In 1936 he was elected president of the Eastern States Archeological Foundation and announced a Works Progress Administration project to restore a 1643 Swedish settlement on Tinicum Island near Chester on behalf of the Historical Commission of Pennsylvania, a precursor to the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.[16]

Author[edit]
Godcharles was the author of many works on Pennsylvania history and was awarded a D. Litt.[17] His first book was Freemasonry in Northumberland & Snyder Counties, Pennsylvania (1911, two volumes).[18] His next book grew out of series of newspaper columns he wrote on Pennsylvania history, the self-published Daily Stories of Pennsylvania: Prepared for Publication in the Leading Daily Newspapers of the State (1924).[19] The New York Times review noted it had "a story for each day of the year", many of them originally "widely published in Pennsylvania newspapers on the anniversary of the event or person concerned", and that "Mr. Godcharles succeeds admirably in choosing and bringing out essential facts and relating it all in a readable style."[20]
In 1933 his five-volume Pennsylvania: Political, Governmental, Military and Civil was published, with volumes on Government (I), Political (II), Military (III), Physical (IV), and Biographical (V) history.[21] In 1944 the four-volume Chronicles of Central Pennsylvania was published.[17] He was an editor of an index to the thirty-two volume Encyclopedia of Pennsylvania Biography.[22]

Joe RobbiePersonal detailsBorn(1916-07-07)July 7, 1916Sisseton, South Dakota, U.S.DiedJanuary 7, 1990(1990-01-07) (aged 73)Coral Gables, Florida, U.S.Political partyDemocraticSpouseElizabeth (1942–1990)Children11EducationNorthern State UniversityUniversity of South Dakota (BA, LLB)
Joseph Robbie (July 7, 1916 – January 7, 1990) was an American attorney, politician, and the principal founder of the Miami Dolphins.


Early life[edit]
Robbie was raised in Sisseton, South Dakota, the second of five children. His father was a Lebanese immigrant and restaurant manager; his mother was a baker and the daughter of Irish immigrants.[1] He was raised Catholic.[2]
At 14 years old, Robbie was the sportswriter for his local newspaper, The People's Press.[3] In 1934, during the Great Depression, Robbie dropped out of high school to work as a lumberjack for the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Black Hills, sending $25 of his $30 monthly earnings home to his family. After completing his high school education in 1936, Robbie enrolled at Northern State Teachers College on a debating scholarship.[1] After three years, he transferred to the University of South Dakota.[2] Robbie met his future wife, Elizabeth, while he was a senior at the school and she was a freshman. The couple were married two years later.[1]
Robbie enlisted in the Navy on the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Robbie saw substantial action in the Pacific theater and was awarded a Bronze Star for his service. After his discharge, he used the G.I. Bill to return to University of South Dakota School of Law as a law student.[1]

Politics[edit]
Following his graduation from law school, Robbie worked as a deputy state's attorney and a professor of economics at Dakota Wesleyan University.[4] In 1948, at 33 years old, Robbie entered politics. He was elected to the South Dakota House of Representatives as a Democrat.[1] In 1950, he ran for Governor of South Dakota but lost to Sigurd Anderson.[2] The following year, Robbie and his family moved to Minneapolis at the encouragement of then-mayor Hubert H. Humphrey.[1]
His political and business careers further developed in Minnesota. In addition to operating his own law firm, Robbie served as regional counsel for the Office of Price Stabilization in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.[5] He was also a charter member of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Commission and chairman of the Minnesota Municipal Commission.[6] In addition to working on Humphrey's political campaigns, Robbie represented Minnesota's 5th congressional district at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.[2][7]
Robbie also worked as a lobbyist for the tobacco industry from the 1960s until his death. In 1963, he appeared before the United States Senate to voice opposition to a bill which would have regulated tobacco advertising.[8] From 1971 until 1989, he was the head of the  Minnesota Candy & Tobacco Distributors Association.[9]

Professional sports[edit]
After moving to Minneapolis, Robbie took an interest in professional football and became a Minnesota Vikings season ticket holder.[10]
In March 1965, Joe Foss, the commissioner of the American Football League, met with Robbie in Washington, D.C. Foss had attended the University of South Dakota, later serving in the Marine Corps and being awarded the Medal of Honor.
At the meeting, Foss recommended that Robbie look into Miami as a potential site for an expansion franchise. Robbie formed a partnership with comedian Danny Thomas, a fellow Lebanese-American, and raised the $7.5 million required to purchase an expansion team.[1]
The Dolphins' stadium was officially called Joe Robbie Stadium from its opening in 1987 until 1996. It has undergone a series of name changes since, and it is currently known as Hard Rock Stadium.
Robbie had a small part playing himself in the film Black Sunday, in which he is interviewed about security for Super Bowl X (1976).[11]
Robbie also owned the Miami Toros and the Fort Lauderdale Strikers (later the Minnesota Strikers) soccer teams of the North American Soccer League. Joe Robbie Stadium was one of the first major stadiums in the U.S. designed with soccer in mind., and was also designed to be easily reconfigured for baseball.
Robbie also believed that given Miami's rapid growth, it was a foregone conclusion that Miami would have a Major League Baseball team: this was proven correct when the city was granted a franchise, the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins), in 1990, two months after Robbie's death.

Honors and awards[edit]
For his contributions to the Miami Dolphins, and being the founder of the team, Joe Robbie became the inaugural inductee on the Miami Dolphins Honor Roll on September 16, 1990 (eight months after his death).

The Alliance of the New Citizen (Slovak: Aliancia nového občana, ANO) was a liberal[4] political party in Slovakia existing from 2001 to 2011. The acronym was a pun on áno, Slovak for "yes". It was founded and led by media entrepreneur Pavol Rusko. The party positioned itself as liberal and was a member of international liberal organisations. It was part of the centre-right governing coalition of Prime Minister Mikuláš Dzurinda from October 2002 to September 2005.
After its first election, its populist appeal waned and it developed a more liberal approach.[5][6]
ANO was legally renamed and thus succeeded (but not in terms of personnel or political positions) by the Free Word Party of Nora Mojsejová (Slovak: Strana Slobodné Slovo – Nory Mojsejovej, SSS-NM) in November 2011, when Eleonóra Mojsejová a Slovak businesswoman and TV personality took over the party. The party changed its name to CITIZENS (Slovak: OBČANIA) in 2013 and in 2014 to IDEA. It was finally dissolved in 2017. The last president was Miroslav Leňo.


Foundation[edit]
The party was founded in 2001 as the Alliance of the New Citizen (ANO). It was the first modern political party in Slovakia to consider itself to be liberal. Its leader Pavol Rusko was also the founder and former owner of Markíza (the biggest commercial TV channel in Slovakia). Rusko at first thought to join the Party of Civic Understanding (SOP) which was part of the previous government, yet after some bad blood, around January 2001 Rusko decided to create a new political party.[7]

Elections and government participation[edit]
In August 2002, Pavol Rusko claimed that the party is financed completely from his own money, and the money of his close friend, businessman Ján Kováčik who borrowed the party an undisclosed sum of money.[8] Rusko estimated the cost of the political party to 25 million Slovak korunas so far, with an additional 15 million expected for the campaign before the 2002 Slovak parliamentary election.[9] In the election, the party finished sixth, gaining 230,309 votes (8.01% total) and capturing 15 out of 150 seats in the National Council of the Slovak Republic.
ANO was a member of the government coalition together with SDKÚ, SMK-MKP and KDH from October 2002 to September 2005, when it was expelled from the coalition after disputes with both SDKÚ and KDH. The party remained in opposition until the next parliamentary election but a group of MPs around Ľubomír Lintner continued to support the government.
The following ANO nominees were part of the Second Mikuláš Dzurinda government:

Deputy Prime Minister - Robert Nemcsics (16 October 2002 — 9 September 2003)
Deputy Prime Minister - Pavol Rusko (23 September 2003 — 24 August 2005)
Deputy Prime Minister - Jirko Malchárek (4 October 2005 — 4 July 2006)
Minister of Industry - Robert Nemcsics (16 October 2002 —	9 September 2003)
Minister of Industry - Pavol Rusko (23 September 2003 — 24 August 2005)
Minister of Culture - Rudolf Chmel (16 October 2002 — 24 May 2005)
Minister of Culture - František Tóth (24 May 2005	— 5 April 2006)
Minister of Culture -	Rudolf Chmel (5 April 2006 — 4 July 2006)
Minister of Health - Rudolf Zajac (16 October 2002 — 4 July 2006)
In March 2003 an internal conflict started within the party between its leader Pavol Rusko and Economy Minister Robert Nemcsics and Deputy Transport Minister Branislav Opaterný. The party's regional organizations unanimously supported Rusko and the party's regional board meetings unambiguously called on both Nemcsics and Opaterný to abdicate from their positions and give up their deputy mandates.[10]
On 6 March 2006, Jirko Malchárek, František Tóth and Alexandra Novotná created a new political party Hope.
In the parliamentary election of June 17, 2006, the party won only 1.42% of the popular vote and lost parliamentary representation. It did not take part in other elections and slowly fell into obscurity.

In 2011 the party was bought by a known Slovak businesswoman Nora Mojsejová who did not have to collect thousands of signatures needed by law to register a new political party. If a party that is already registered changes its name, no signatures are necessary. Mojsejová changed its name to Free Word Party of Nora Mojsejová and entered the 2012 Slovak parliamentary election where she received 1.22% of votes, not winning any seats in the National Council but finishing ahead of long-time Slovak Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar's People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
In 2013 party changed its name to CITIZENS. In 2014 party changed again its name to IDEA and new president became Miroslav Leňo.

Nigel Edwards is a health policy researcher, appointed Chief Executive at the Nuffield Trust in April 2014.[1]
He was formerly an expert advisor with KPMG’s Global Centre of Excellence for Health and Life Sciences, a Senior Fellow at The King’s Fund. He was Policy Director of the NHS Confederation for 11 years.[2]
He has commented on government announcements about the English NHS, such as George Osborne's promise to find extra cash for the NHS,[3] and the reconfiguration of cancer services in Staffordshire.  In 2014 he is reported as saying " that   "there's nothing intrinsically bad about private or public sector provision",[4] and that   the Better Care Fund might live up to the advertised savings if it concentrated entirely on moving people out of hospital into residential care.[5]
He was reckoned by the Health Service Journal to be the 42nd most influential person in the English NHS in 2015.[6]
As of autumn 2017 Edwards is concerned about the condition and funding of the NHS.  Edwards stated, “It is indisputable that the NHS is facing a yet another difficult winter. But whether or not it experiences a full-blown crisis will depend largely on unpredictable events, like a sudden outbreak of flu or norovirus. What is clear is that, seven years into austerity, the pressure on the system is immense, making the health service much less resilient to these kinds of events than is comfortable.”[7]
In drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic in England he says the emphasis on building hospitals as inexpensively as possible. led to situations that proved highly problematic when hospital staff were faced with large numbers of infectious patients.[8]

Mary ChubbBorn(1903-03-22)22 March 1903Died22 January 2003(2003-01-22) (aged 99)NationalityBritishAlma materCentral School of ArtOccupation(s)Author and archaeologistEmployer(s)Egypt Exploration Society  Oriental Institute, University of Chicago
Mary Chubb (22 March 1903 – 22 January 2003) was a British writer and archaeologist. She has been described as "the first professional excavation administrator".[1][2] She was the daughter of John Burland Chubb (1861–1955), A.R.I.B.A., and a descendant  the Bridgwater artist John Chubb (artist),  1746–1818.


Career[edit]
Archaeology[edit]
Chubb has been described as an "accidental archaeologist".[2] She took as job at the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) to fund her study of sculpture at the Central School of Art in London, and not because she had an interest in archaeology or Egyptology.[1][2] After a year as the under-secretary at the EES's London base, doing odd jobs as the secretary refused to pass any real work onto her, she felt like quitting.[3]: 11–12  Having been sent into the basement to look for a drawing that was to be included in one of the Society's publications, she found an object that would trigger her interest in archaeology, something that the previous twelve months of work had not.[2] She described this moment in her book Nefertiti Lived Here:[3]: 13–15 

It was a piece of glazed tile—that was all—but at that blank, bleak moment of depression, it touched off some unguessed spring. ... When I turned it over, a trickle of fine yellow sand slipped through my fingers... Egyptian Sand. I was holding something that had scarcely been touched since it had been found in Egypt years before... Suddenly I was invaded by a great longing; I wanted to know all I could about the place where the tile had come from... I looked down at the tile again... a shutter in the mind that till then had separated my living self from everything I had heard about Ancient Egypt, lifted suddenly and quietly.
Chubb left her under-secretary job at the Egypt Exploration Society and volunteered herself as a "secretarial dogsbody" to their excavation of Tell el-Amarna in Egypt.[1] She slowly developed skills and became an important member of the team. Her administrative work "helped to set new standards in archaeological publication".[2] After the end of the dig at Amarna, she joined the excavations in Iraq, at Ur and Eshnunna, run by the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago;[1] she held the tile "Field Secretary to the Iraq Expedition of the Oriental Institute".[4] She then spent 1938 at the University of Chicago writing up their recent excavations.[1]

Author[edit]
After returning to England during World War II, Chubb was involved in an accident that would end her archaeological career. She was hit by a military lorry while riding a bicycle and was seriously injured; she survived the crash but lost her leg and lived the rest of her life physically disabled.[1] In 1942, while recuperating from her injury, she realised it would stop her from attending any more archaeological excavation, and so she turned her talent to writing.[3]: 180–81 
Chubb wrote a number of books on archaeology for the general public and also wrote a number of children's books on people of the ancient world. She also branched out into journalism, writing for magazines such Punch and for the BBC.[1] Her children's book were in the form of alphabet books in which each letter was a word linked to the book's topic and a paragraph followed that explained the word; e.g., in her An Alphabet of Ancient Egypt, the letter C was for Cartouches and this was followed by a basic explanation of how to read hieroglyphics.[5] Her two main books were published in the 1950s; Nefertiti Lived Here (1954) and City in the Sand (1957). These books are about her involvement in the 1930s excavations of Tell el-Amarna in Egypt, and of Ur and Eshnunna in Iraq.[6][7] They were republished in the 1990s with new introductions and added epilogues.
She curated her family's archive of the art and papers of her ancestor, the Bridgwater artist John Chubb (artist), (1746 - 1816), and wrote two articles about it in The Countryman.[8][9] The collection was sold to the Blake Museum, Bridgwater, in 2004.

Personal detailsEducationUniversity of Michigan (BS, MPH)
Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty is an American scientist and former government official who served as the under secretary of energy for nuclear security and administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration. Earlier in her career, she had served in various other leadership positions in the Department of Energy and the National Security Council.


Education[edit]
Gordon-Hagerty graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in 1983 and a Master of Public Health in health physics in 1986.[1][2] During her graduate studies, she worked at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site.[2]

Career[edit]
After graduation, she worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. She then moved to Washington, D.C., to join the staff of the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce.[1]
She then spent six years in the Department of Energy as the director of the Office of Emergency Response and acting director of the Office of Weapons Surety.[3][4] As director of the Office of Emergency Response, she had authority to activate the Nuclear Emergency Search Team,[5] which led The Washington Times to compare her to a "female James Bond".[6][7]
In July 1998, she became director of the White House Office of Combating Terrorism under the National Security Council.[1] She was appointed during the Clinton administration and remained in the position into the Bush administration. She was closely involved in its response to the September 11 attacks,[2] and was present in the White House compound during the attacks.[8]
She then served in several positions in the private sector. From 2003 to 2005, she was executive vice president and COO of United States Enrichment Corporation. She then was president of consulting firm Tier Tech International and president and CEO of consulting firm LEG.[2][4] She was named to Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women in 2004, 2005 and 2006.[4] She also served on the board of experts for the Federation of American Scientists.[4][9]
Gordon-Hagerty was appointed by President Donald Trump as under secretary of energy for nuclear security and administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, confirmed by the U.S. Senate on February 15, 2018[10] and was sworn in on February 22, 2018.[3][9][11] In September 2019, she was named as one of five finalists for National security advisor after the resignation of John Bolton,[12] although the position ultimately went to Robert C. O'Brien.[13] On November 6, 2020, she resigned from her positions, reportedly due to longstanding tensions and disagreements with Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette.[14] In December 2020, it was announced that Gordon-Hagerty would be appointed to the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee.[15] Gordon-Hagerty has been appointed to the board of directors of Visible Assets as of March 2021.[16]

Personal life[edit]
During a congressional committee hearing, Representative Curt Weldon compared Gordon-Hagerty to a character in the 1997 thriller The Peacemaker, a counterterrorism director portrayed by Nicole Kidman. She was reportedly underwhelmed by this, quoted as jokingly saying "I have more important things to do than advise Nicole Kidman."[1][17]
In 2007, she married Walter Houston, the founder and CEO of Tier Tech International.[18]

Abu Muhammad 'Abdallah ibn Muhammad ibn Hajjaj ibn al-Yasmin al-Adrini al-Fessi[1] (Arabic: ابن الياسمين) (died 1204),[2] more commonly known as ibn al-Yasmin, was a Berber mathematician during the Middle Ages. He was born in Morocco and received his education in Fez and Sevilla. Little is known of his personal life except that he was born into a Berber family.[1][2] Since some historians have given him the surname al-Ishbili, he may have been born or grown up in Sevilla.[2] Besides mathematics, he also became famous in literature, law, and particularly in Andalusian poetry.[2]

The Monk (also known as The Final Temptation or The Seduction of a Priest) is a 1990 historical drama film directed by Francisco Lara Polop and starring Paul McGann and Sophie Ward.[1] Based on the 1796 Gothic novel The Monk by Matthew Gregory Lewis, it was adapted for the screen by Polop, and employs the common depiction of the 18th century representing “the stately, the lavish, the sensuous, and even the lubricious.”[2]  In this way, The Monk can be seen as a heritage film, in which “the past is delivered as a museum of sounds and images, an iconographic display,”[3] though these films are sometimes discredited as attempts to “transform the past into a series of commodities for the entertainment market.”[4] The film was Lara Polop's last as a director, and continues the themes of eroticism and horror found throughout his works.[5]


Synopsis[edit]
The film begins in 18th century Spain, with Father Lorenzo (Paul McGann) and Mother Agueda (Isla Blair) being tried before the Spanish Inquisition, and Lorenzo agreeing to confess and tell his story in order to escape torture. The setting then turns to the past, where Lorenzo is a charismatic and admired priest. He listens to a confession by a young nun named Sister Ines (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), who has become pregnant, and reports her to the covenant's leader, Mother Agueda, despite the girl's pleas for help.
After this, a young monk named Juan reveals to Lorenzo she is actually a woman, Matilde de la Venegas (Sophie Ward).  Matilde is a wealthy orphan who fell in love with Lorenzo while attending one of his sermons, and entered his covenant in disguise in order to be near him.  Lorenzo goes to report her and she threatens to commit suicide, claiming she does not care about the damnation this act would bring her.
Elsewhere in the covenant, the nuns are gathered and debating what to do with Sister Ines.  Some of the nuns want to report to her the Inquisition, following protocol and ensuring the girl a fair trial, but Agueda, angered by Ines's denials of her advances, convinces the nuns that the girl's obvious guilt allows the covenant to deal with her themselves, and they imprison Ines in a cell beneath the monastery.
Matilde continues to pursue Lorenzo, though he still wants her to leave, as he is attracted to her and afraid of breaking his priestly vows.  She agrees to go, but as Lorenzo reaches into the garden to give her a goodbye rose, he is bitten by a snake.  He recovers only to discover Matilde saved his life by sucking the venom from his wound, poisoning herself gravely ill in the process.  Lorenzo is overcome by her love for him and they make love, breaking Lorenzo's vows.
Ramon (Mark Elstob), a young nobleman and Ines’ lover, coming looking for her at the covenant, but is turned away.  When he later returns with a papal order for Ines’ release from the covenant, Agueda lies to him that Ines died from a sudden illness.  Lorenzo becomes the confessor for an elderly member of his congregation, and impassioned by his regained sexuality, begins pursuing the woman's innocent daughter Angela (Sophie Linfield).  He becomes distant from Matilde and confronts Angela, but she denies him and he is thrown out of the house.  Matilde convinces Lorenzo to continue after Angela, saying she will do anything to make him happy, and reveals she knows black magic. Lorenzo agrees to her plan, and in a Satanic ritual Matilde creates a potion that will leave Angela helpless to Lorenzo.  That night Angela's mother discovers Lorenzo administering the potion to her sleeping daughter, and Lorenzo kills her to keep her from crying out.  Matilde appears to Lorenzo in a demonic form, and instructs him to cover up the murder by making it appear as though she committed suicide.
While Lorenzo is attempting to rape Angela in the bedchamber of the covenant, Ramon arrives with the Inquisition and discovers Ines imprisoned in the basement.  Needing to hide from the Inquisition, Matilde attempts to kill Angela but is stopped by Lorenzo, who regrets aloud conspiring with Matilde in the first place.  The inquisition discovers them in the act and the story returns to the present, where Lorenzo is still being tried before the Inquisition.  Agueda is imprisoned for life for her illicit confinement of Ines, and Lorenzo is convinced of devil-worship, and is burned at the stake.

Variance from source text[edit]
There are a number of differences between the film and the original novel.  Lorenzo is named Ambrosio in Lewis's novel, and Angela is named Antonia.  The film version leaves out multiple subplots, such the bleeding nun and Lorenzo's sister, and has Lorenzo burned at the stake, omitting the majority of the book's conclusion, which has Lorenzo instead sell his soul to the Devil in order to escape the Inquisition, only to be denied repentance and condemned to eternal torment.

Other adaptations[edit]
Le Moine, Ado Kyrou, (1972). Luis Buñuel and Jean-Claude Carrière attempted to film a version of The Monk in the 1960s, but the project was halted due to lack of funds.  Buñuel's friend, the Greek director Ado Kyrou, used this script as the basis for his 1972 film version. Le Moine (English: The Monk) boasted an international cast with Franco Nero in the title role. The film also starred Nathalie Delon, Eliana de Santis, Nadja Tiller and Nicol Williamson.

The poster image was created by Imago for the then distributors of the film, to be launched at Cannes. The image was a three part composite (pre computer graphics) and featured Gail McKenna as the female model with Terry Waeland as the monk figure, whose face was supplanted by a supplied portrait of Paul McGann. The fiery background was created at Lower Austin Lodge farm using heavily yellow and magenta filtering on the camera lens. The whole composition was photographed by Rodney Compton and composited by Dennis Nowak.

Its name suggested that it was a town of the Agraei; but the narrative in Polybius would imply that it was not so far north.[1] In 314 BCE, Agrinium was allied with the Acarnanians when Cassander marched to the assistance of the latter against the Aetolians. As soon as Cassander returned to Macedonia, Agrinium was besieged by the Aetolians and surrendered. Many of the inhabitants of Agrinium were executed by the Aetolians.[2]
Its site is located near the modern Agrinio (formerly Vrachori),[3][4] renamed to reflect association with the ancient town.

Plain Dealing is a town in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 893 in 2020.[3] It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan statistical area.


History[edit]
Prior to 1839, the United States government forcibly removed the Caddo Nation of Native Americans—longtime local inhabitants who had first settled the area over 1,000 years before Europeans' 16th-century arrival in mainland North America—from the area of Northern Louisiana that included the parcel that would later become the town of Plain Dealing.[4]
In 1839, George Oglethorpe Gilmer and his son, James Blair Gilmer, bought 5,000 acres of this land—now described as a "vast, unsettled wilderness"—from the United States government, calling a portion of this acreage "Plain Dealing" after the family's Virginia plantation.[4][5]  The "Plain Dealing" name became official when the town was formally chartered on April 24, 1890.[4]
On 26 March 1893, during an evening school dance at Plain Dealing High School, a fight broke out. Two students were shot and killed immediately, two more were fatally wounded, and the high school's Professor Johnson was wounded in the arm.[6]

Geography[edit]
Plain Dealing is 8 miles (13 km) south of the Arkansas border and 31 miles (50 km) north of Shreveport.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.6 square miles (4.1 km2), of which 0.004 square miles (0.01 km2), or 0.26%, is water.[7]

Climate[edit]
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Plain Dealing has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Plain Dealing was 114 °F (45.6 °C) on August 10, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was −14 °F (−25.6 °C) on February 13, 1899.[8] The record high temperature is also the highest temperature ever recorded in Louisiana.[9]

Basilica of Kleinmariazell
Altar
Kleinmariazell is a district of Altenmarkt an der Triesting in the Wienerwald, Lower Austria, Austria.


Geography[edit]
Kleinmariazell is located north of Altenmarkt in a side valley of the Triesting in the direction of Klausen-Leopoldsdorf.
The cloister lies on an old pilgrim's trail, the Via Sacra from Vienna to Mariazell.
The community, as well as the cloister, is described and referred to as Mariazell in Austria (as opposed to Mariazell in Styria), Klein-Mariazell Monastery, or Klein-Mariazell Abbey. Aside from a few houses on the street and an inn, it is made up exclusively of the historic cloister buildings.

History[edit]
History of Kleinmariazell:

1134 or 1136: The church and monastery were founded by Heinrich and Rapoto of Schwarzburg-Nöstach as well as the Babenberg Margrave Leopold III the Holy of Austria as Cella Sancte Marie, a Benedictine monastery.
1782: The monastery was dissolved in the course of the Josphine Reforms and felt into decay.
1825: The monastery and its lands were put up for auction. Many owners followed, and the monastery was turned into a palace. The former monastery church became the local parish church.
1998: After a general renovation by the Archdiocese of Vienna with public and private support, the church was returned its original purpose.
2005: Near the church complex an apartment annex was built to hold, among others, 8 priests.
The current group of buildings follows the modern ideas of restoration and monument protection. The names of Christoph Cardinal Schönborn and Deacon Franz Eckert are closely connected with the building.[citation needed]

Frescoes[edit]
During 1764 - 1765, Johann Baptist Wenzel Bergl painted numerous frescoes in the basilica.

Partial general elections were held in Suriname in March 1874 to elect three of the nine elected members of the Colonial States.


Electoral system[edit]
The Colonial States consisted of nine elected members and four appointed by the Governor-General.[1] Elected members served six-year terms, with three members elected every two years. The 1874 elections were to replace the three members elected in 1868, B.E. Colaço Belmonte [nl], Fergus Carstairs [nl] and A.J. van Emden [nl]. However, Carstairs had resigned in 1873 and been replaced by Johannes Cateau van Rosevelt.
The elections were held using the two-round system, with suffrage restricted to men meeting certain criteria. Voters had multiple votes, and any candidate receiving a number of votes equivalent to over 50% of the valid ballots cast was elected in the first round. If not all seats were filled, a second round was held with twice the number of candidates as seats remaining, who were the candidates who received the most votes but failed to be elected in the first round.

Results[edit]
As there were 125 valid ballots cast, candidates required 63 votes to be elected in the first round. All three incumbents were re-elected in the first round.

Aftermath[edit]
Governor-General Cornelis Ascanius van Sypesteyn [nl] reappointed Phoebus Hitzerus Verbeek [nl] and appointed three new nominated members, G.J.A. Bosch Reitz [nl], Joël Benjamin Vos [nl] and Jacob Evert Wesenhagen [nl].
The newly elected States met for the first time on 12 May 1874, with Bosch Reitz appointed chairman.[2]
E.F.L. Mollinger [nl], who had been elected in 1872 resigned in April, after the elections had taken place. His seat was left unfilled until July, when he was replaced by David Baëza [nl]. N.T.A. Arlaud [nl], who had been elected in 1870, died in October 1874 and was replaced by Henry Barnett [nl]. Nominated member Verbeek resigned in January 1875, while fellow nominee Wesenhagen died in March 1875. The two were replaced by Karel Daniel Brakke [nl] and Jacobus de Jong [nl] in May. In the same month, Daniel Benjamins [nl] (elected in 1870) resigned; in June he was replaced by the returning Verbeek.
In December 1875 David Baëza died, and was replaced the following month by Jacob Alexander Salomons [nl]. Johannes Cornelis Muller [nl], elected in 1872, resigned in February 1876 and was replaced by G.H. Barnet Lyon [nl].

The  statue of Margaret Thatcher in the Guildhall, London, is a marble sculpture of the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. It was commissioned in 1998 by the sculptor Neil Simmons by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art;[1] paid for by an anonymous donor, it was intended for a plinth among statues of former Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom in the Members' Lobby of the House of Commons. However, as the House did not permit a statue to be erected there during its subject's lifetime, the work had been temporarily housed in Guildhall.[2] It was unveiled there by Lady Thatcher in February 2002.[3][4]

Decapitation[edit]
On 3 July 2002, theatre producer Paul Kelleher decapitated the statue while it was on display at Guildhall Art Gallery.[3][5][6] Having unsuccessfully taken a swing at the statue with a Slazenger V600 cricket bat concealed in his trousers, Kelleher picked up a metal pole from a nearby rope cordon and used it to decapitate the £150,000 statue.[3][5][6][7] After the vandalism he waited to be arrested by the police who arrived minutes later. He joked on capture: "I think it looks better like that."[7]
Following the loss of its head, the statue was removed from display. Although it was estimated that the work could be repaired for about £10,000, statue experts worried that it would never be the same.[7]
At his first trial, Kelleher said in his defense that the attack involved his "artistic expression and my right to interact with this broken world". The jury, despite nearly four hours of deliberation and a direction from the judge that it could decide by the majority, failed to agree on whether or not he had "lawful excuse".[6] He was retried in January 2003, found guilty of criminal damage and sentenced to three months in jail.
On 21 February 2007, a new statue of Thatcher was commissioned in 2003 from sculptor Antony Dufort and this time in tougher silicon bronze. It was erected on the reserved plinth in the Members' Lobby.[8]  The rule against living subjects had been relaxed by this stage and Thatcher unveiled the statue.[9] By then, the marble statue had been repaired, but it remains in Guildhall. After several years in the Guildhall Art Gallery, the statue was moved to a corridor location elsewhere in the Guildhall building.[10]

Samuel A. Mulledy SJ (/mʌˈleɪdi/ muh-LAY-dee;[1] March 27, 1811 – January 8, 1866) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who served as president of Georgetown College in 1845. Born in Virginia, he was the brother of Thomas F. Mulledy, who was a prominent 19th-century Jesuit in the United States and a president of Georgetown. As a student at Georgetown, Samuel was one of the founding members of the Philodemic Society, and proved to be a distinguished student, which resulted in his being sent to Rome to complete his higher education and be ordained to the priesthood. Upon his return to the United States, he became the master of novices at the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland, before being named president of Georgetown. He sought to be relieved of the position after only a few months, and returned to teaching and ministry.
Mulledy was expelled from the Society of Jesus over charges of alcoholism in 1850. He took up ministerial work at congregations throughout the northeastern United States, remaining at each for no more than a few years. He eventually became chaplain to Archbishop John Hughes and was assigned as an assistant at the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in New York City (later known as St. Ignatius Loyola), where he became pastor in 1863 and lived out the remainder of his life. On his deathbed, he petitioned the Jesuit provincial superior to allow him to be readmitted to the Society; four days before his death, his request was granted and he professed his vows.


Early life[edit]
Samuel A. Mulledy was born on March 27, 1811, in Romney, Virginia (today located in West Virginia).[a][3] His father, Thomas Mulledy, was a farmer and a Catholic of Irish descent.[4][5] His mother, Sarah Cochrane, was from Virginia and was not Catholic. So the two could marry, they obtained a canonical dispensation, and agreed that their sons would be raised Catholic, while their daughters would be raised Protestant.[6] Samuel's brother, Thomas F. Mulledy, was 17 years older than him,[7] and also became a Jesuit and the president of Georgetown College.[5]

Education[edit]
At a young age, Samuel became a teacher with his brother at the Romney Academy.[8] He then began his studies at Georgetown College in 1829,[9] paying his own way like his brother. He paid some of his tuition in kind, in the form of two horses.[4] At Georgetown, he became a co-founder and the first vice president of the Philodemic Society,[10] which held its first meeting on September 25, 1830, and he signed its constitution.[11] At the commencement of 1831, he received the class medal for rhetoric and mathematics, and an honorable mention in French;[12] he also delivered an address in French.[13] His brother was president of the college throughout Samuel's studies.[14][15] Completing his secular education, Samuel sought admission to the Society of Jesus. His application was approved and, on August 29, 1831, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in White Marsh Manor in Maryland, where he completed his probationary period and took his simple vows.[3]
He was then sent to the novitiate at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome, being chaperoned across the Atlantic Ocean by William McSherry.[16] Mulledy was sent to Rome for his higher studies because of his academic talent, so that he would be well educated and return to the United States to teach.[17] In total, he studied in Rome for seven years, including at the Roman College,[18] where he garnered a reputation as a distinguished student, and was selected to give a public defense of theology.[18] Mulledy was then ordained a priest in Rome in 1840, and made his "grade"[b] in the Society of Jesus.[18]

Academic career[edit]
Mulledy then returned from Europe and on November 1, 1841, he was appointed the master of novices of the Jesuits' Maryland Province.[18][20][21] He succeeded Francis Dzierozynski, and on January 15, 1844, he was succeeded by Dzierozynski.[22] In 1844, he was made minister of Georgetown College.[18]

Georgetown College[edit]
Mulledy became the president of Georgetown College on January 10, 1845,[16] when James A. Ryder was recalled to Rome.[23] He was young for a holder of the position, but was known as a talented scholar.[24] He assumed the office reluctantly,[16] and his short-lived tenure was generally uneventful. The entire college attended the inauguration of President James K. Polk in 1845, and upon the request of the Mayor of Georgetown, the college students marched in the parade commemorating President Andrew Jackson on July 1 of that year. Soon after taking office, he requested to be relieved,[16] and he was succeeded by his brother, Thomas Mulledy, on September 6, 1845.[25]

Later life[edit]
Drifting years[edit]
Georgetown College shortly after Mulledy's time there
Following the end of his presidency, Mulledy returned to missionary work, being stationed at St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia.[26] However, he continued to remain involved at Georgetown as a member of its board of directors from 1846 to 1848.[27]
From 1847 to 1848, he was a professor of dogmatic theology at Georgetown,[18] and subsequently taught rhetoric there.[28] Eventually, Mulledy became an alcoholic, which resulted in his dismissal from the Society of Jesus in 1850.[29][28] Following his expulsion, he was transferred from city to city, staying only briefly in each.[29] He first was stationed at the original Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston for two years, then worked in the Diocese of Albany from 1852 to 1853. The following year, he was sent to the Cathedral of St. James in Brooklyn, where he remained until 1855.[28] He was a professor of rhetoric and mathematics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, during the 1856–57 academic year.[30] He then was assigned to the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in South Boston and St. Mary's Church in Yonkers, New York, in 1859 and 1860, respectively.[28]

Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole[edit]
In July 1861,[31] Mulledy was assigned by Archbishop John Hughes as an assistant to Walter J. Quarter, who was pastor of the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in New York City (later known as the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola). Mulledy was also the chaplain to Archbishop Hughes.[6] Shortly before his death, Quarter sent a letter to the vicar general for the Archdiocese of New York requesting that Mulledy be appointed as his successor.[32] Following Quarter's death, Mulledy, who was still recovering from his alcoholism,[29] became the pastor of the Church of St. Lawrence O'Toole in 1863.[33] During his first year, he had as an assistant priest W. Coyle, and James Hassan assisted him during his later years.[34]
Mulledy was well-liked by the congregation there,[35] and he founded a chapter of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul,[36] to increase the charitable work of the parish. He was known for traveling around the parish with his large, black Newfoundland dog, which was both his pet and protection against stray dogs.[34] Traveling for his ministry became difficult because of asthma, as well as an enlarged aorta in 1865. He ceased his ministry on Christmas Day of that year.[37]
He was the last secular pastor of the church.[38] On his deathbed, he was attended by several Sisters of Charity,[39] and John Early, the president of Georgetown, frequently inquired about his health.[37] He supplicated the provincial superior, Angelo M. Paresce, to allow him to be re-admitted to the Jesuit order. When he received word that his request was granted on January 4, 1866,[40] Mulledy leapt out of bed and pronounced the Jesuit formula on his knees,[41] renewing his religious vows.[29]
Mulledy died in New York on January 8, 1866.[26] His body was escorted by a large crowd from the Harlem Bridge up to St. John's College (later Fordham University) in the Bronx, where he was buried in the College Cemetery.[40] Since Mulledy was once again a Jesuit at the time he died in office,[29] Archbishop John McCloskey decided to transfer administration of the parish to the Jesuits,[33] at Mulledy's request. His successor was the Jesuit priest Victor Beaudevin.[42]

Oikophobia (Greek: oîkos, 'house, household' + phóbos, 'fear'; related to domatophobia and ecophobia[1]) is an aversion to a home environment, or an abnormal fear (phobia) of one's home[2] and also a tendency to criticize or reject one's own culture and praise other cultures.[3]
In psychiatry, the term is also more narrowly used to indicate a phobia of the contents of a house: "fear of household appliances, equipment, bathtubs, household chemicals, and other common objects in the home."[4] In contrast, domatophobia specifically refers to the fear of a house itself.[4]
The term has been used in political contexts to refer critically to political ideologies that are held to repudiate one's own culture and laud others. One prominent such usage was by Roger Scruton in his 2004 book England and the Need for Nations.
In 1808, poet and essayist Robert Southey used the word to describe a desire (particularly by the English) to leave home and travel.[5] Southey's usage as a synonym for wanderlust was picked up by other 19th-century writers.


In psychiatry[edit]
In psychiatric usage, oikophobia may narrowly refer to fear of the physical space of the home interior, where it is especially linked to the fear of household appliances, baths, electrical equipment, and other aspects of the home perceived to be potentially dangerous.[4] In this psychiatric context, the term is properly applied to fear of the objects within the house, whereas the fear of the house itself is referred to as domatophobia.[4]
In the post-World War II era, some commentators used the term to refer to a supposed "fear and loathing of housework" experienced by women who worked outside of the home and who were attracted to a consumerist lifestyle.[6]

Political usage[edit]
In his 2004 book England and the Need for Nations, British philosopher Roger Scruton adapted the word to mean "the repudiation of inheritance and home".[7] He argues that it is "a stage through which the adolescent mind normally passes",[8] but that it is a feature of some, typically leftist, political impulses and ideologies that espouse xenophilia, i.e. preference for foreign cultures.[9]

Scruton uses the term as the antithesis of xenophobia.[10] In his book, Roger Scruton: Philosopher on Dover Beach, Mark Dooley describes oikophobia as centered within the Western academic establishment on "both the common culture of the West, and the old educational curriculum that sought to transmit its humane values." This disposition has grown out of, for example, the writings of Jacques Derrida and of Michel Foucault's "assault on 'bourgeois' society result[ing] in an 'anti-culture' that took direct aim at holy and sacred things, condemning and repudiating them as oppressive and power-ridden."[11]: 78  He continues:[11]: 83 
Derrida is a classic oikophobe in so far as he repudiates the longing for home that the Western theological, legal, and literary traditions satisfy ... Derrida's deconstruction seeks to block the path to this 'core experience' of membership, preferring instead a rootless existence founded 'upon nothing.'
An extreme aversion to the sacred, and the thwarting of the connection of the sacred to the culture of the West is described as the underlying motif of oikophobia; and not the substitution of Christianity by another coherent system of belief. The paradox of the oikophobe seems to be that any opposition directed at the theological and cultural tradition of the West is to be encouraged even if it is "significantly more parochial, exclusivist, patriarchal, and ethnocentric."[11]: 78  Scruton describes "a chronic form of oikophobia [which] has spread through the American universities, in the guise of political correctness."[7]: 37 
Scruton's usage has been taken up by some U.S. political commentators to refer to what they see as a rejection of traditional U.S. culture by the liberal elite. In August 2010, James Taranto wrote a column in the Wall Street Journal entitled "Oikophobia: Why the liberal elite finds Americans revolting", in which he criticizes supporters of the proposed Islamic center in New York as oikophobes who were defending Muslims and aimed to "exploit the 9/11 atrocity."[12]
In the Netherlands, the term oikophobia has been adopted by politician and writer Thierry Baudet, which he describes in his book, Oikophobia: The Fear of Home.

Southey's usage[edit]
In his Letters from England (1808), Robert Southey describes oikophobia as a product of "a certain state of civilisation or luxury." referring to the habit among wealthy people to visit spa towns and seaside resorts in the summer months. He also mentions the fashion for picturesque travel to wild landscapes, such as the highlands of Scotland.[13]

Southey's link of oikophobia to wealth and the search for new experiences was taken up by other writers, and cited in dictionaries.[14] A writer in 1829 published an essay about his experience witnessing the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, saying:[15][T]he love of locomotion is so natural to an Englishman, that nothing can chain him home, but the absolute impossibility of living abroad. No such imperious necessity acting upon me, I gave way to my oiko-phobia, and the summer of 1815 found me in Brussels.In 1959, Anglo-Egyptian author Bothaina Abd el-Hamid Mohamed used Southey's concept in his book Oikophobia: or, A literary craze for education through travel.[16]

Thomas Glassey (26 February 1844 – 28 September 1936) was an Irish-born Australian politician.
Born in Markethill, County Armagh, he received no formal education, working as a mill-worker and miner in Scotland and England. He migrated to Australia around 1885, when he became a miner at Bundamba, and was Secretary of the Bundamba Miners Association. He was a founding member of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland, and was the first Labor member of any Australian parliament when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1888 as the member for Bundamba.[1][2]
Defeated in 1893, he was subsequently member for Burke from 1894 to 1896 and Bundaberg from 1896 to 1900.[2] He left the Labor Party in 1899 over the party's socialist objective. In 1901, he was elected to the Australian Senate for Queensland,[3] unofficially as a Protectionist (though there was no protectionist organisation in Queensland at the time). In 1903, the National Liberal Union endorsed non-Labor candidates, and Glassey, as a Deakinite, did not receive endorsement. He contested the Senate as an independent protectionist and received 25.6% of the vote, but was not elected.[4]
Glassey died in 1936 and was buried in Toowong Cemetery.[5]

Rāg Lalit is a studio album by Indian classical musician Ram Narayan, released in 1989. Recorded December 3, 1987, in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth, Wales, the album features a performance of the serene dawn raga Lalit on sarangi. Narayan performs a long non-metrical introduction to unfold the raga, during which he adds a pulse, until he is joined by tabla to perform a composition.


Origin[edit]
Main article: Lalit (raga)
The album consists of a single track performance of the raga Lalit. Lalit is commonly described as calm and devotional and is performed at dawn.[1] Neil Sorrel portrayed Lalit as conveying a feeling of instability and connects this to the performance time, when night changes into day.[2]

Rāg Lalit was recorded in a single take in Wyastone Leys near Monmouth, Wales, on December 3, 1987, and includes the tuning of the sarangi's sympathetic strings through plucking.[2] In the performance, Narayan plays a long alap (non-metrical introduction) and a jor (performance with pulse) that increases in speed and range and makes use of gamaks (note oscillations).[2] Suresh Talwalkar, a frequent accompanist of Narayan, joins in playing a gat (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in the rhythmic 16-beat cycle tintal, which is separated into four groups of four beats.[2] When Talwalkar plays a solo, the sarangi repeats the melody.[2] The performance was mastered in England, but not edited.[2] In the same session that produced Rāg Lalit, the 1987 album Rāg Bhūpāl Toṛī, Rāg Paṭdīp was recorded.[3]
The album cover features a 19th-century painting of the goddess Tripura Sundari,[4] also called Lalita. A picture of Narayan playing the sarangi is on the back of the album, along with a quote of Yehudi Menuhin praising Narayan.

A Sherpa couple in traditional attire.
Sherpa marriages are a rich and intricate combination of culture, cosmology, and communal solidarity.

The Proposal[edit]
Astrological charts are central to all the events leading up to a traditional Sherpa marriage. They are consulted before anything is done. When the prospective groom's family decide to visit the girl's family with the proposition of marriage, they decide an auspicious day by consulting the birth charts of the boy and girl. Sherpa children are assigned an animal at the time of their birth, and these corresponding animals are also matched when a boy and a girl's birth charts are matched. This is done to determine the compatibility of the two people in question. After a day is selected by a lama, the close relatives of the groom (preferably ones whose parents are still alive) accompany him to the girl's house. Surprisingly, the boy's parents do not join this party.[1] This ceremony is known as Sodené ('to ask'). The ceremony is a simple offering of a jar of Chhaang, the traditional Sherpa barley beer, by the boy's family to the girl's. If the girl's family accept the jar, the marriage proposal is believed to be accepted. From that day onward, the girl is effectively a member of the boy's family.

OpiconsiviaObserved byRoman Republic,Roman EmpireTypeClassical Roman religionDate25 August
The Opiconsivia (or Opeconsiva or Opalia) was an ancient Roman religious festival held August 25 in honor of Ops ("Plenty"),[1] also known as Opis, a goddess of agricultural resources and wealth. The festival marked the end of harvest, with a mirror festival on December 19 (during Saturnalia) concerned with the storage of the grain.[2]
The Latin word consivia (or consiva) derives from conserere ("to sow"). Opis was deemed a chthonic (underworld, inside the earth) goddess who made the vegetation grow. Since her abode was inside the earth, Ops was invoked by her worshipers while sitting, with their hands touching the ground, according to Macrobius (Saturnalia, I:10). 
Although Ops is a consort of Saturn, she was closely associated with Consus, the protector of grains and subterranean storage bins (silos). Consus is therefore thought to be an alternate name of Saturn in the chthonic aspect as consort. The festival of Consus, the Consualia, was celebrated twice a year, each time preceding that of Ops: once on August 21, after the harvest, and once on December 15, after the sowing of crops was finished. 
The Opiconsivia festival was superintended by the Vestals and the Flamines of Quirinus, an early Sabine god said to be the deified Romulus.  Quirinus was absorbed by, and included in, the first and earliest Capitoline Triad, along with Mars—then an agriculture god—and Jupiter. The main priestess at the regia wore a white veil, characteristic of the vestal virgins. A chariot race was performed in the Circus Maximus. Horses and mules, their heads crowned with chaplets made of flowers, also took part in the celebration.

Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott in her youth
The Hon. Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott (2 October 1852 – 15 March 1920) was a Scottish author of historical novels and non-fiction and the great-granddaughter of the novelist Walter Scott.

Portrait of The Hon. Mrs Mary Maxwell-Scott by William Edward Miller
Abbotsford, Scottish Borders
She was born in Tunbridge Wells in Kent[1] as Mary Monica Hope Scott in 1852, the only surviving child of James Hope-Scott (1812-1873) and his wife Charlotte Harriet Jane née Lockhart (1827-1858), daughter of John Gibson Lockhart and grand-daughter of the noted Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott. Until her own children were born Mary Monica was the only living descendant of Sir Walter Scott. In 1868, as the heir to her father, she applied for a loan of £2,000 to have the land at Abbotsford House drained; as a minor she received her father's consent for the loan.[2] On the death of her father in 1873 she inherited Abbotsford House, the home of Walter Scott.[3] In London in 1874 she married the Hon Joseph Constable-Maxwell, third son of William, Lord Herries, following which the couple adopted the surname Maxwell-Scott. Like her great-grandfather, she became a writer of historical books. She also wrote a number of books about her famous ancestor including an authoritative guide to Scott’s collection of 'gabions' titled Abbotsford: a Guide to the Personal Relics and Possessions of Sir Walter Scott.[4]
Mary Maxwell-Scott had eight children, five of whom survived her. These were: 

Margaret Mary Lucy Constable-Maxwell-Scott (d. 1912)
Maj.-Gen. Sir Walter Constable-Maxwell-Scott, 1st Baronet (1875-1954)
Mary Josephine Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1876-1922); married Alexander Dalglish in 1897[5]
Winifride Mary Josephine Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1878-1880)
Joseph Michael Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1880-1911)
Rear-Admiral Malcolm Raphael Joseph Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1883-1943)
Alice Mary Josephine Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1885-1908)
Herbert Francis Joseph Constable-Maxwell-Scott (1891-1962)
On her death in 1920 her eldest son, Sir Walter Constable-Maxwell-Scott, inherited Abbotsford House.[4] Her grand-daughters were Patricia Maxwell-Scott (1921-1998) and Dame Jean Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott (1923-2004).
The Hon. Mary Monica Maxwell-Scott died at 7 Egerton Terrace in London in 1920 aged 67.[6]

Production[edit]
William Job had played Hamlet on stage in Adelaide in 1952. He then went to England and Canada and had only recently returned to Australia, appearing in a TV production of The Seagull.[7] It was Georgie Sterling's third TV appearance after The Multi-Coloured Umbrella and Sorry Wrong Number.
The show used some basic special effects to create the ghosts.[8]
Owen Weingott helped choreograph the fight scene.[9]
The production had a ten-minute intermission.[4]

Reception[edit]
The production was well received. The Australian Woman's Weekly called it "two hours of engrossing TV... It was just pleasure and wonderful entertainment. Even if you didn't like Shakespeare, any televiewer would appreciate the notable production and camera work.... A most satisfying night of TV."[9]
A critic from the Sunday Sydney Morning Herald said that it "proved that Shakespeare can be successfully translated to television" with Morley's direction responsible for "much of the credit... he kept the field of action small, relying on _closeups to intensify the drama. I also thought that William Job's portrayal of the young and tragic Dane was outstanding... A night to remember"[10]
A critic from the daily Sydney Morning Herald thought the production suffered from "the skimping of preparation time, the skimping of histrionic talent, and the skimping of imagination and subtlety" although it said Job's performance was one of "sensitiveness, vision and skill".[11]
The critic from The Age thought it was much better than Anthony and Cleopatra.[12]
The Bulletin thought the tragedy of the play "shrank  to middle-class size;   Hamlet  was   a   G.P.S.   boy   angry   and hurt   by   what   had   been going on at   home   during   term" but felt "the   production   was  sound   enough—even, in   places, admirable."[13]
It was repeated in 1961 and 1964.[14]

Arches of the cloister
Early history[edit]
The first church on top of the hill was already built in 1301, when a nearby church begun to be built by Greyfriars. Historiographers of the monastery (Trani, Granić in Frasson) wrote that Giuseppe Tartini received his first musical education in the monastery where his parents hired a room for him after 1700 A.D. From 1954 to 1990, it was nationalized and with denationalization it was given back to the church in 1996.[1]

Tartini family[edit]
At 300th anniversary of Giuseppe Tartini's birth, blueprints of old gravestones including the one belonging to Tartini's family, were found in the monastery's archives.[1]

Architecture[edit]
Leading to the cloister there is a half-arched portal adorned with richly carved columns, bearing an architrave with an inscription and coats of arms.

Musical events[edit]
The atrium of the monastery has been for decades the venue for Musical Evenings of Piran events.

Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev in Don Quixote ballet
Ivan Vladimirovich Vasiliev (born 9 January 1989) is a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer.[1][2] He graduated from the Bielorussian Ballet School in 2006.
Early on, he won prizes that include First Prize and Best Dancer Prize at the Arabesque-96 Ballet Competition in Perm in 2005, First Prize at the Moscow International Ballet Competition in 2006, Special Distinction of the Varna International Ballet Competition in 2006, Rising Star of Soul of Dance Award in 2008, one of "25 to Watch" of Dance Magazine 2008,[2]  Benois Prix de la Danse in 2009, Virtuosity Prize of International Dance Open in Saint Peterburg in 2010, followed by the Grand Prix the following year, Best Dancer of 2011 UK Critic's Award. In 2014 he was granted the title of "Honoured Artist of Russia". In 2015, by public poll, he was awarded Discovery of the Year QG Prize, for his first ballet evening as choreographer.


Career[edit]
Vasiliev joined the Bolshoi Ballet in the end of 2006, as first soloist. When 2010 came to an end he had already performed the leading roles in Le Corsaire, Flames of Paris, Don Quixote, Giselle, La Fille Mal-Gardée, Spartacus, Petrouchka, The Nutcracker, La Esmeralda, La Bayadère and been promoted to the rank of principal of the Bolshoi Ballet; he was the last dancer to be coached by Roland Petit in the role of Le Jeune Homme, and had joined The Kings of The Dance international group of male dancer stars.
Vasiliev and Natalia Osipova, his then-fiancée, left the Bolshoi in the end of 2011, in the search for wider artistic horizons. They both became principals of the Mikhailovsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, with plenty of freedom to perform worldwide as guests.[3] Vasiliev became a regular guest principal at the  American Ballet Theatre, La Scala and the Bolshoi. He also performed leading roles in Mariinsky Theatre, Stanislavsky Theatre, Novosibirsk Theatre, English National Ballet, Bayrisches Staatsballet, and the Australian Ballet. The Kings of The Dance initiative brought him through many countries during 5 years. In 2015 he became regular principal also in the Novosibirsk Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, Vasiliev started to dedicate himself to choreography too. He staged an evening in the spring of 2015 with short pieces, an evening with three one-act ballets in the spring with 2016, and a full length Christmas ballet the following winter. In May 2016, one more one-act ballet was presented in the scope of Project for Young Choreographers in Bolshoi.

Oberto Della Torre (1617 in Genoa – 1698 in Genoa) was the 130th Doge of the Republic of Genoa and king of Corsica.

Biography[edit]
During his mandate as Doge, the eighty-fifth in biennial succession and the one hundred and thirtyth in republican history, some disagreements with the Spanish Governor  of the neighbouring Duchy of Milan are remembered due to the blockade of the income of the Genoese nobles in that territory, on the other hand, the Doge had cordial relations with the Charles II, as the Spanish Empire was a great ally of the Genoese Republic. After the end of his Dogate on 1 September 1691, Oberto Della Torre retired to private life. He died in Genoa in 1698.[1]

Purificacion "Pura" Villanueva Kalaw[1] (27 August 1886 – 21 March 1954) was a Filipina beauty queen, feminist, journalist, and writer.


Early life[edit]
Purificacion Garcia Villanueva was born in the town of Arevalo, Iloilo to Emilio Villanueva and Emilia Garcia. Her mother was born in Palencia, Spain. In 1908, at age 22, Pura Villanueva became the first "Queen of the Manila Carnival."[2]

Career[edit]
In 1906 Pura Villanueva organized a suffrage group, the Asociacion Feminista Ilongga.[3] Her efforts led to the first suffrage bill reaching the Philippine Assembly in 1907.[4] Pura Villanueva wrote a column for the weekly newspaper El Tiempo, and edited the woman's page. Later she edited the Spanish-language section of Woman's Outlook, a pro-suffrage publication (Trinidad Fernandez Legarda was the English-language editor). She was also president of the Women's Club of Manila.[5]
Books by Pura Villanueva Kalaw included Osmeña From Newspaperman to President (1946),[6] How the Filipina Got the Vote, Outstanding Filipino Women, Anthology of Filipino Women Writers, The Consumer Cooperatives in the Philippines, The Filipino Cookbook, and A Brief History of the Filipino Flag.[7] Her 1918 booklet Condimentos Indigenas was "one of the earliest cookbooks" published in the Philippines.[8]
In 1951, Pura Villanueva Kalaw was honored with a Presidential Medal, presented by President Elpidio Quirino, for her work on behalf of women's rights in the Philippines.[9]

Personal life[edit]
Pura Villanueva married lawyer and editor Teodoro Maniguiat Kalaw in 1910. Their children included Maria Kalaw Katigbak, a senator, and Purita Kalaw Ledesma, an art critic. Their daughter-in-law Eva Estrada Kalaw was also a senator. Pura Villanueva Kalaw became a widow in 1940. 

Death[edit]
She died on 21 March 1954 at the age of 67.[3]

Legacy[edit]
Her daughter Maria Kalaw Katigbak published a biography, Legacy: Pura Villanueva Kalaw: Her Times, Life, and Works 1886–1954 in 1983.[10] Pura V. Kalaw was one of the suffragists featured in a 2016 exhibit at the Philippine Embassy in Washington, D.C.[11]
There is a school in Quezon City named for Pura V. Kalaw.[12]

Thomas Carter PC (c. 1690 – 3 September 1763) was an Irish politician and MP who served as the Master of the Rolls, sat on the Privy Councillor and served as Secretary of State in Ireland. British nobleman and writer Horace Walpole described him as "an able and intriguing man".


Education[edit]
Carter entered Trinity College, Dublin on 9 January 1701, and graduated B.A. in 1710.[1]

Political career[edit]
Carter was Member of Parliament MP for Trim in County Meath, from 1719 to 1727. In 1727 he was returned as a member for Hillsborough, Dungarvan, and Lismore, but chose to sit for Hillsborough, and held the seat until 1761.[2]
The Carters were a political family. Thomas Carter, the first to live at Castlemartin which he acquired in 1729, was made Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1731, which office he had continued to hold until 1754. He was a skilful and experienced parliamentarian and political organiser. A strong, if not often violent Whig, noted for his rudeness and his loathing of English ministerial interference in Irish affairs and his satirical lampooning of political opponents earned him the nickname "Vicious Carter".
During the late 1740s, Carter became one of the leaders of the country of Ireland as a member of the Patriot party along with Henry Boyle, speaker of the Irish House of Commons and Anthony Malone, the Prime Sergeant.
He was made Master of the Rolls in 1731 but as one of the parliamentary managers employed by the Lord Lieutenant to ensure that the King's business was passed in the House of Commons, his actions were often maverick. Horace Walpole said of him that he had "Constantly fomented every discontent against the Lord Lieutenants in order to be bought off". Such behaviour was common in 18th-century politics where interest was so often for sale. Quite content to "feather his own nest", Carter did not always help his colleagues.

The Money Bill dispute[edit]
Both the zenith and the nadir of Carter's career came during the Money Bill dispute of the 1750s. The crisis came in 1753–56 when the Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, Henry Boyle, refused to hand over an Irish tax surplus to London.
As a result, Primate Stone Archbishop of Armagh, tried to reduce the influence of the leading parliamentary undertakers; Speaker Boyle, Anthony Malone and Thomas Carter. The archbishop tried to replace them with his own supporters, the Ponsonbys led by the Earl of Bessborough. Boyle, Malone and Carter whipped up popular support, turning the issue into a trial of strength between the Lord Lieutenant and the country or "Patriot" party.  Boyle, helped by Carter's wickedly provocative tongue, began a whispering campaign against Primate Stone. There was a personal antagonism between Carter and Primate Stone as the latter had been instrumental in foiling Carter's attempts to obtain the reversion of his office of Master of the Rolls for his young unknown and inexperienced son.
The whole episode of the Money Bill dispute, the motives, intrigues, manoeuvrings and chicanery was wittily and ironically described by Edmund Sexton Pery, an eye-witness and MP for Wicklow town. His description is written in the form of a letter to the Duke of Bedford around the time he was appointed Lord Lieutenant in 1757.
The dispute became an oft-quoted precedent to the policy of the Irish Patriot Party of the 1780s.

Family[edit]
Thomas Carter was born in 1690, the son of Thomas Carter (1650–1726) and his wife born Margaret Houghton, of Robertstown, County Kildare. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and the King's Inns.
He married on 12 October 1719 at St Anne's, Dublin, Mary Claxton, youngest daughter of Thomas Claxton of Dublin and Lucy Pearce, and so first-cousin of Edward Lovett Pearce who built them a magnificent house at No.9 Henrietta Street with the finest staircase hall in Dublin. They had two sons and three daughters. Their daughter Frances was the mother of Frances, Lady Jersey. Their daughter Susan was a grandmother of Elizabeth, Marchioness of Thomond.
Thomas Carter made significant contributions to farming and country pursuits, not sparing any expense to bring them to perfection. He imported the best breed of cattle.

Castle Martin in the snow
He originally leased Castle Martin in the early 1730s as his country seat, and did not buy the house and that estate until 1761, just two years before he died while staying with his elder son, Thomas MP, at Rathnally House, Trim. Twelve days after his father's death[3] Thomas proceeded with his marriage to Anna Armytage, daughter of the Yorkshire baronet Sir Samuel Armytage, but they had just one child, Mary, later Mrs Skeffington Thompson, before young Thomas Carter MP himself died.
So Carter was succeeded at Castlemartin by his second son Henry Boyle Carter, named after his father's friend and political ally, Speaker Boyle. In 1750 Henry married Susanna Shaen, widow of James Wynne, daughter of Sir Arthur Shaen, 2nd baronet, and his Catholic wife Susanna Magan, by whom Henry had three sons and one daughter. (see Carter-Campbell of Possil). Carter's descendants continued to live at Castlemartin until they sold the estate to the Blackers in 1850.

Thomas Carter (1650–1726) M.P. father of Thomas Carter (1690–1763)[edit]
Main article: Thomas Carter (died 1726)
Thomas Carter the elder was obviously a very ambitious young man, he married firstly Margaret Houghton (c. 1660-1696) on 16 December 1681 at St. Audoen's Church, Dublin. During the revolution, he served with distinction at Derry and the Boyne where according to Burke's Irish Landed Gentry (1850 edition) he secured books and writings belonging to James II of England. What happened to these papers is not known. He was elected as an MP to the Irish House of Commons and became Second Sergeant at Arms being returned first for Fethard and then for Portarlington.
He married secondly, Isabella, the dowager Countess Roscommon on 2 August 1702 by which marriage he acquired the extensive Roscommon estates in and around Trim. The Countess was born Isabella Boynton. They had no children and she died in 1721. Thomas Carter's father's seat was at Robertstown, County Meath.

A male heir (not the heiress that resulted) may have had a good case to obtain his grandfather's estates.

Saints Alphaeus and ZacchaeusMartyrs14th century painter - Two Martyr Saints in an Initial SPersonal detailsDied303 or 304 ADCaesarea
Saints Alphaeus and Zaccheus were two Christians who were put to death in Caesarea, Palestine, in 303 or 304, according to church historian Eusebius in his Martyrs of Palestine. They are commemorated on November 18.


Background[edit]
There are two extant versions of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine and in both the shorter and the longer versions the stories of Alphaeus and Zaccheus are recounted, though with variations.
Eusebius was present in Caesarea during the persecutions, part of the empire-wide campaign to suppress Christianity.

Persecution of Christians in Caesarea[edit]
The Emperor Diocletian had ordered that all in the Empire should perform worship and sacrifices to the Roman gods. The authorities in Caesarea were so keen that all should obey this order that, according to the shorter recension of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, they seized one Christian leader by the hands, led him to the altar and thrust the offering into his right hand. He was then dismissed as if he had performed the sacrifice. It was agreed by those in charge that they would attest that two others had made the offerings, even though they had not. Another Christian opened his mouth to say that he refused to worship the Roman gods when the guards struck him across the face, prevented him from speaking, and dismissed him, so that, says Eusebius, of the many brought in from the area to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods or die, only two, Alphaeus and Zaccheus, "were honored with the crown of the holy martyrs."[1]

Zaccheus[edit]
The authorities in Caesarea had brought in Christians from the surrounding area to apostasize or face death.  Among them was a deacon from Gadara, Zaccheus, so-called after the person in the New Testament, according to Eusebius in the long recension of Martyrs of Palestine, owing to his short stature and sweet nature. He spoke boldly of his faith before the judges, was tortured and put into a prison cell.[2]

Alphaeus[edit]
Cousin of Zaccheus, Alphaeus was the lector of the church in Caesarea.[3] Many Christians in the city and its surroundings, faced with the choice of their religious principles or death, were crowding into the city to perform sacrifices to the gods, when Alphaeus loudly and publicly denounced their apostasy.[2] Whereupon he was brought before the judges, ordered to sacrifice, but refused, making defiant statements of his faith.[2]

Martyrdoms[edit]
Alphaeus and Zaccheus were tortured together over a period of days, and repeatedly offered the opportunity to sacrifice to the gods and be freed, but they refused despite their sufferings. They were finally both decapitated on the same day.[2]

Labadie is an unincorporated community in Franklin County, Missouri, United States. It is located approximately three miles north of Gray Summit.

History[edit]
The community is named after Sylvester L'Abaddie,[2] a hunter who (by some accounts) was killed by a bear in nearby Labaddie's Cave. A county history published in 1968, however, records that he "died peacefully in his bed in his 70th year, on July 25, 1849, at his home on Olive Street in St. Louis."[3] Labadie post office was established June 7, 1855. Labaddie Creek enters the Missouri River here, and this was the location of Labaddie Station of the Missouri Pacific Railroad.

Notable Places[edit]
The Bethel Church and James North House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[4]
Labadie Energy Center, a coal-fired power plant owned by Ameren, began generation in 1970.[5] In 2019, Ameren was ordered by a federal judge to install equipment at the plant to reduce its carbon emissions.[6] Ameren has also faced backlash from community environmentalist groups due to the coal ash landfill located on the energy center's property.[7]

CLAAS is an agricultural machinery manufacturer based in Harsewinkel, Germany, in the federal state of North Rhine Westphalia. Founded in 1913 by August Claas, CLAAS is a family business and one of the market and technology leaders in harvesting technology. It is the European market leader in combine harvesters and considered as world market leader in self-propelled forage harvesters. The product range also includes  tractors, balers, mowers, rakes, tedders, silage trailers, wheel loaders, telehandlers and other harvesting equipment as well as farming information technology.[2] CLAAS employs around 11,500 employees worldwide and reported a turnover of roughly 3.9 billion euros in the 2019 financial year. About 78.5% of sales are generated outside of Germany.[3]


History[edit]
Early days[edit]
The beginnings of the company go back to 1887, when Franz Claas founded a company in Clarholz for the production of milk centrifuges. From about 1900 onwards, he also manufactured other agricultural machinery there, such as straw binders and cutters for mowing machines.
The official foundation of the company took place in 1913, when the son of Franz Claas, August Claas, informed the responsible office in Herzebrock that he was manufacturing straw binders with two locksmiths and one unskilled worker. In 1914 his brothers Franz jun. and Bernhard Claas also joined the company. The company was then continued under the name "Gebr. Claas". The fourth brother, Theo, officially joined the company as a partner in 1940.

Growth period[edit]
After their return from the First World War, the Claas brothers and sisters moved their company to Harsewinkel in 1919, where they bought a disused hard stone factory and continued production. The export of Claas products now also began from Harsewinkel, initially to Holland, France and Belgium.
In 1930, the development of the first CLAAS combine harvester began, initially as machines using the fore-cut principle. The first CLAAS straw baler was produced in 1931. In 1936, the company launched the first combine harvester designed specifically for European harvesting conditions, the combine harvester (ger. Mäh-Dresch-Binder – MDB). This was then mass-produced from 1937. Until the production was stopped due to the war in 1943, approx. 1400 machines were produced.


CLAAS JAGUAR

In 1956 a new factory was established in Paderborn. This was now the third location besides the plant in Harsewinkel and the Christopherus-Hütte in Gütersloh-Blankenhagen, which was built in 1948. In 1961, the new CLAAS baler factory in Metz (France) was added, which has been operating under the name Usines Claas France S.A. since 1969.
Helmut Claas, the son of August Claas, became managing director for Engineering in 1962. By then CLAAS was already the No. 1 combine harvester manufacturer in Europe. 1969 saw the takeover of Josef Bautz AG in Saulgau with a factory for forage harvesting machinery. One year later, the Speiser company from Göppingen, which specialised in forage harvesting technology. The company continued to grow steadily and presented new products for forage harvesting such as mowers, tedders, windrowers, loader wagons and trailed forage harvesters.[4][5]
In 1978 Helmut Claas took over as chairman of the management board.

Establishment as a global agricultural technology company[edit]
Since the 1990s, the company has strengthened its international presence in non-European countries. New production and sales locations were established in India (1989), the US (1999), Russia (2005), China (2012/2014) and South America, among others. With the acquisition of a majority stake in Renault Agriculture in 2003, CLAAS expanded its product range to include standard tractors. On 11 February 2003, the 400,000th combine harvester left the production line at the main plant in Harsewinkel.
In 2011 the LEXION 770 set a Guinness World Record with 675.84 tonnes of grain harvested in eight hours.[6]
With the construction of the new development center for electronics in Dissen, Lower Saxony, CLAAS set the course for another important future field in 2017: the digitalization of agriculture.
Since 1 October 2019 the company has been led by CEO Thomas Böck.[7]

Product portfolio[edit]
CLAAS is well known as harvest specialist, offering combine harvesters in various sizes. The largest model series is the LEXION, which has been produced since 1995 and is now in its fourth generation. The LEXION 8900 has a maximum output of 790 hp and is available with tyres or crawler tracks (TERRA TRAC) on the front axle. Both options allow a top speed of 31 mph (50 km/h). The cutter bars are up to 13.79 meters wide and the grain tank holds up to 18,000 liters. CLAAS offers also the two smaller combine product families, the TRION and the EVION. CLAAS also offers a TUCANO 320 from the former TUCANO range which consisted of the TUCANO 500, TUCANO 400, and the TUCANO 300, which was only recently discontinued in Favour of the TRION/EVION Ranges.[8]
In August 2021, CLAAS unveiled a new product line of harvesters called TRION. The TRION is a Replacement for the Larger TUCANO models and the Smaller 2012-2019 Lexion Harvesters. The range consists of the TRION 700, TRION 600, and TRION 500 series. They are powered by Cummins engines.[9]
In July 2023, CLAAS unveiled the new EVION 400 Harvester Range, a Replacement for the previous AVERO and smaller TUCANO models.[10]
The CLAAS forage harvester is called JAGUAR. CLAAS is considered as world market leader in the silage chopper market.[11]
The manufacturer produces and sells tractors from 47 hp to 530 hp. The XERION is the biggest tractor in the CLAAS product range, and is easy to recognize with four equally-sized wheels.
The AXION model series is available from 205 hp (AXION 800) to 445 hp in the AXION 960. Since 2019, CLAAS has offered an optional track system for the AXION 900 series, instead of the rear wheels, called TERRA TRAC.
The ARION model range consists of Tractors ranging from 95 hp (ARION 410) to 205 hp (ARION 660). The ARION model range includes the ARION 400, ARION 500, ARION 600, and ARION 600C.[12]

CLAAS is an international company active worldwide.

Harsewinkel, Germany[edit]
Harsewinkel, CLAAS' headquarters, hosts the company's administration and a major factory.
Harsewinkel plant was opened in 1919. Combine harvesters have been manufactured here since 1936. To date, over 400,000 have been built. CLAAS produces also forage harvesters and the XERION tractor in Harsewinkel. Between 2000 and 2003, the factory was expanded so that not only finished machines but also individual components for other CLAAS plants can be produced.[13] The machines manufactured at the main plant in Harsewinkel are transported about half by rail and half by truck. The choice of the means of transport depends mainly on the destination country. To Western Europe (especially Germany, France, Spain), transport is mainly by road. To the seaports of Bremen and Hamburg as well as to Southeast and Eastern Europe (especially Poland, Romania and former CIS states) rail transport is predominant. The importance of rail traffic is reflected in the fact that as early as 1967, a 3.1-kilometer-long connecting railway was built, leading from the Ibbenbüren – Gütersloh line of the Teutoburger Wald-Eisenbahn (TWE) to the company's own Harsewinkel-West works station.[14]

Bad Saulgau, Germany[edit]
CLAAS's facilities in Bad Saulgau develop, test and manufacture forage harvesting machines and attachments. Additionally, the chopper unit of the JAGUAR comes from this production site. The Bad Saulgau site is also home to a test center for forage harvesting technology and the CLAAS Group's Competence Center for Tractor-Implement-Automation (TIM).[15]

Le Mans, France[edit]
Following the acquisition of a majority stake in Renault Agriculture, CLAAS has also been offering a complete range of tractors since 2003.[16] All CLAAS tractor models except of the XERION are manufactured at the Le Mans factory, two hours' drive southwest of Paris.[17] In 2021, a three-year refurbishment of the factory was completed.[18]

Metz, France[edit]
At the CLAAS plant in Metz, 400 employees manufacture balers for the agricultural industry. Since the start of production in 1958, over 300,000 have been manufactured. Each type of baler is produced on its own welding and sheet metal processing line. This saves costly retooling and enables the simultaneous production of all models.[19]

Törökszentmiklós, Hungary[edit]
800 employees work at the Hungarian location Törökszentmiklós, southwest of Budapest. It has been part of the CLAAS Group since 1997 and has developed into the competence center for cutter bars and drum mowers.[20]

Columbus, Indiana and Omaha, Nebraska, US[edit]
CLAAS machines have been harvesting in North American fields since the 1950s. Since the founding of the CLAAS of America (COA) sales company in 1979 and the subsequent laying of the foundation stone in Columbus, Indiana, in 1981, sales have been handled by CLAAS dealers. With the growing business in the US, the spare parts department in Columbus, which is responsible for the entire US and Canada, has also been greatly expanded.
The production company CLAAS Omaha (COL) has been manufacturing LEXION combine harvesters since 1999. COL is also jointly responsible for product development of the US machines. The plant is located in the largest grain growing areas in the US and was initially operated in cooperation with Caterpillar – since 2002 fully owned by CLAAS. Today, the LEXION combine harvesters are no longer sold exclusively through Caterpillar dealers, but also through other distribution channels.[21] Until 2019 the combines produced in Omaha had a yellow and black paint. With the start of the production of the new LEXION model series for the North American market at the factory in Omaha, Nebraska color scheme changed to the typical CLAAS green-white-red.

Krasnodar, Russia[edit]
The factory in Krasnodar, located in the granary of Russia, started operations in 2005. This made CLAAS the first major agricultural engineering manufacturer to operate its own production facilities in Russia. The production facility in Krasnodar is designed for a capacity of 1,000 machines per year and aims to develop into a local center of excellence in agricultural engineering. In 2015, the company invested a further 120 million euros in the expansion of the plant. Combine harvesters are produced there including metalworking, painting and assembly.[22]

Sunchales, Argentina[edit]
As early as the 1950s, CLAAS sold harvesting machines to Argentina. The local subsidiary has existed since 2000 in Sunchales, Provinz Santa Fé. In addition, five further spare parts and service centers ensure that CLAAS service is guaranteed throughout Argentina.
In 2006 the possibility that CLAAS Argentina set up a factory in Argentina was tangible and by 2013, began to produce the TUCANO combine harvester, with a motor of 270 to 360 hp (Class VI or VIII). Models produced include the TUCANO 570,[23] TUCANO 470[24] and TUCANO 560.[25] At the same time, the company advanced assembly capacity.
In the town of Ameghino, Buenos Aires, CLAAS manufactures headers and other equipment and components.

Chandigarh, India[edit]
CLAAS opened a plant near Chandigarh in 2008. It is located 300 km north of New Delhi, in the middle of the most fertile areas of Northern India. The plant is designed for a capacity of around 900 combine harvesters per year. The CROP TIGER combine harvester is mainly produced in the Chandigarh plant in both wheeled and TERRA TRAC tracked versions. With the crawler tracks, this machine is particularly suitable for wet soils and is therefore sold in Southern India, Sri Lanka, South Korea and other South-East Asian countries. The wheeled version of the CROP TIGER is mainly used in dry conditions such as in Northern India, the Middle East and Africa.

The statue of Ivan Konev (Czech: Socha Ivana Koněva) was a monument to Russian general Ivan Konev that was erected in Prague in 1980. In the late 2010s, it became a subject of controversy within Czech Republic–Russia relations, resulting in its removal in 2020.


History[edit]
Monument in late 2019, covered up
Czech journalists covering the incidents related to the statue in 2019
The statue was unveiled during the Soviet Victory Day celebrations on 9 May 1980, and intended to commemorate Marshal Ivan Stepanovich Konev, who was one of several commanders of Red Army troops that captured Prague from the hands of the Germans near to the end of World War II.[1] It depicted a life-sized figure of Konev, holding in his hand a bouquet of lilacs, which civilians allegedly presented to the Red Army when it entered Czechoslovakia in May 1945. It was located in Prague district 6 (Interbrigády Square, Bubeneč area). The statue was designed by Czech sculptor Zdeněk Krybus [cs] and architect Vratislav Růžička.[2][3]
After the fall of the communist regime in 1989 and the Czech transition to a democratic government, it became a subject of frequent vandalism, particularly on the anniversary of the Prague Spring, a revolution that was put down by invading Soviet forces.[4][1][5] The local government proposed relocating the monument to the Russian embassy.[1]
In 2018, the city added explanatory text to the monument, stating that Konev participated in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring.[6] The explanatory text has been criticized by the Russian embassy.[1][7] The diplomatic spat over this text has been one of the issues leading to the deterioration of Czech-Russia relations.[8][9]
On 21 August 2019, an unknown individual spray-painted "No to the blood-covered marshal, we shall not forget" on the statue.[10] The mayor of Prague 6 said that he is considering leaving the monument uncleaned, remarking that "red, after all, means beautiful in Russian".[1] By September 2019, the Prague municipal authorities had covered up the monument, no longer willing to incur the cost of cleaning it up. The move proved to be controversial, as within days the tarpaulin covering the monument had been torn down three times; two individuals, described by Czech media as "pro-Russian activists", were detained by the police.[11]
The monument was finally removed on 3 April 2020 during lockdown and the state of emergency imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech Republic, with the Czech president Miloš Zeman criticizing the removal as "an abuse of the state of emergency".[12][10][1] Within days, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation announced it would begin a symbolic investigation of the alleged "defiling of symbols of Russia's military glory".[13] The mayor of Prague district 6 subsequently went into hiding under police protection, out of concerns of an alleged saxitoxin and ricin poison plot for his actions regarding the statue.[14][15][16][17][18][19][20] The poison threat was later revealed to have been a hoax originating from the Russian embassy. The Czech government expelled two Russian embassy diplomats; Andrey Konchakov (Russian: Андрей Кончаков), who headed the Russian Center for Science and Culture (Rossotrudnichestvo) (Russian: Россотрудничество) in Prague, and his subordinate Igor Rybakov, an FSB officer.[17][21][a] Russia has also opened criminal proceedings, but the Czech authorities stated that Russia has no legal jurisdiction in this case.[4]
Shortly after removal, local Prague authorities announced they are considering displaying the monument in the planned Museum of the Memory of the 20th Century [cs], while the Russian and Czech ministries noted they are also discussing plans to have the statue transferred to Russia.[25][4]
In June 2020, during an arts and landscape festival in Prague, 12 small temporary statues of Ivan Konev were unveiled, painted to look like figures such as Batman, Superman, the Joker, and Adolf Hitler.[26]
For thirty days in December 2022, the plinth was occupied by Ahriman the Demon, a statue created at an international convention of blacksmiths, depicting Vladimir Putin as a goblin wielding a gas tap and making a Nazi salute.[27] It was to be auctioned off to support Ukraine during the Russian invasion, an effort organized by businessman Dalibor Dědek.[27]

Notes[edit]


^ Igor Rybakov (Russian: Игорь Рыбаков; born 1971, Omsk), who performed military service at Soviet-Afghan border, joined FSB in 1995 in the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional System (now the Second Service of the FSB), studied law at the FSB Academy in Moscow from 1997 to 2000, transferred to Bitsa Park or the "forest" (Russian: "лес") at Yasenevo outside the Moscow Ring Road on the outskirts of Moscow which is the FSB headquarters and training grounds for FSB special forces known as Alpha Group at the Special Forces Center,[22] and then worked as an expert in international politics in the United States, Syria where he performed secret operations between Manaf Tlass and the Kremlin, Afghanistan, Morocco and the Czech Republic.[17] Igor Rybakov worked closely with members of the Donald Trump administration, is very close to Russian mafia including both Igor Makarov and Semion Mogilevich, and ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Omsk in 2017.[17] In 2018, he began working for RS, which is known as Russian Center for Science and Culture (Rossotrudnichestvo), under KGB-SVR officers Alexander Ledenev (Russian: Александр Леденев) and Sergei Kruppo (Russian: Сергей Круппо) in the department for interaction with international organizations through which FSB officers are posted to Rossotrudnichestvo.[17] Since December 2017, Eleonora Mitrofanova (Russian: Элеонора Валентиновна Митрофанова) is the head of RS replacing Lyubov Glebova (Russian: Любовь Глебова) who headed RS from 23 March 2015 to 26 September 2017.[17][23] Farit Mukhametshin (Russian: Фарит Мухаметшин) was the first head of RS which was established in 2008 from the former Roszarubezhtsentr (Russian: Росзарубежцентр) leading RS from 17 October 2008 to 5 March 2012.[17] Mukhametshin was followed by Konstantin Kosachev (Russian: Константин Косачев) who headed RS from 5 March 2012 to 22 December 2014 and instituted RS as an instrument of "soft power" (Russian: «мягкой силы»).[17][24]

Gogte Group is an Indian conglomerate, headquartered in Belgaum, Karnataka, involved in mining, minerals, salts and textiles. The conglomerate was founded by Raosaheb Gogte, beginning in 1957.


History[edit]
Gogte Mines[edit]
In the early 1950s, Japanese interest in the iron and manganese ores of Portuguese Goa led Raosaheb Gogte, a lawyer at the time, to explore the possibility of mining for the ores in the districts of Ratnagiri and North Kanara. In 1954, he began mining for manganese near Kuveshi. With financial encouragement from local lenders, Gogte established the Gogte Mines company and began mining for iron ore at Redi in 1957, having leased 187 acres and 16 gunthas for the project, and producing 15,000 tonnes of iron ore within the first four months.[1][2]
In 1962, the company came under scandal when one of its mines collapsed, injuring several workers.[3] When contractors began demanding higher rates, he commissioned two self-propelled barges for the transport of the ore, which were inaugurated by Yashwantrao Chavan and his wife.[4] Turning a profit after a decade of functioning, Gogte formally incorporated his mining company on July 20, 1967.[2]
By 1972, the company was exporting iron and manganese ore to Europe and the Middle East.[5] By 1973, the company was considered one of the leading exporters of iron ore in Maharashtra,[6] with their mine in Redi, being cited as the principal producer.[7]

Gogte Salts[edit]
In 1963, Gogte scouted 1500 acres of land near Nala Sopara for developing a salt works.[8] He tasked his brother Vasudev with its management, who would apply French and Tunisian techniques of salt production at the works. The Gogte Salts company was inaugurated in 1964 at the hands of Sadashiv Govind Barve,[1] after Gogte's brother Vaman, dealt with lengthy legal proceedings to obtain letters of intent from the government for the company to go into commercial production in Maharashtra.[9] Negotiations concluded, after the company acquiesced to manufacture both edible and industrial salt for which the government would allot 2,000 acres of land to the company.[10] In July 1964, the Government of Maharashtra gave the company licenses to manufacture soda ash and ammonium chloride.[11]

Gogte Minerals[edit]
By 1974, Gogte had secured buyers for the company's iron ore in Romania, formally incorporating the Gogte Minerals company on February 23, 1977, for promotion of ammonium chloride fertilizers.[12] As of 2020, the company's research in the use of the minerals it mines, as well as the company's export practices have been cited by several government and educational institutions studying the field.[13][14]

Gogte Textiles[edit]
On May 17, 1980, Gogte established Gogte Textiles, venturing into textiles, manufacturing cotton yarns and fabrics. Under the advisement of S. M. Krishna, he pursued to obtain a license from the Government of Karnataka under Gundu Rao, to set up a textile mill in Kakti, acquiring 100 acres for the venture, and ordering weaving machinery from Switzerland. After promises of financial encouragement from the Ministry of Industry fell through, Gogte appealed to R. N. Malhotra at the Reserve Bank of India for provision of working capital. Financial encouragement came from the State Bank of Mysore and IDBI, under the advisement of Shankarrao Chavan.[2]
In the late 1980s, Gogte's son Arvind, and his wife presented samples of their Textile Mills' terrycloth towels to then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, when they learned that his wife Sonia Gandhi had enquired after them. When Gandhi requested Gogte to arrange a visit to the mills, the mills' workers went on strike. By 1990, the Gogte Textile Mills was one of the largest exporters of textile goods in Karnataka.[1]

“Let That Be Your Last Battlefield” is the fifteenth episode of the third season of the original American science fiction television show Star Trek. Written by Oliver Crawford (based on a story by Gene L. Coon, writing under his pen name "Lee Cronin") and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast January 10, 1969.
In the episode, the Enterprise encounters two survivors of a war-torn planet, each half black and half white (though on opposite sides from each other), each committed to destroying the other.
The episode guest-stars Lou Antonio and Frank Gorshin.


Plot[edit]
The Federation starship Enterprise is on a mission to help decontaminate the polluted atmosphere of the planet Ariannus, when sensors detect a Federation shuttlecraft that was reported stolen. The craft is brought aboard along with its alien pilot, who identifies himself as Lokai, a political refugee from the planet Cheron. Lokai's most striking feature is that his skin is ink-black on one side of his body and chalk-white on the other.
Shortly thereafter, sensors detect another spacecraft in pursuit of the Enterprise. The alien craft disintegrates, but not before its pilot, Bele, transports to the Enterprise bridge. He is colored black and white, similar to Lokai. Bele explains that he is on a mission to retrieve political traitors. His current quarry is Lokai, whom he has been chasing for 50,000 Earth years. Bele is taken to Lokai, and the two begin to argue about the history of their peoples, including whether it was justified for Bele's people to dominate Lokai's people; the two men almost come to blows.
Bele demands that Captain Kirk take him and Lokai to Cheron. Kirk refuses, telling him he will have to make his case to Federation authorities. Some time later, the ship changes course to Cheron, and Bele announces that his "will" has taken control of the ship. When Lokai demands the death of Bele, Kirk orders both of them to be taken to the ship's brig, but a force field generated by both aliens makes that impossible. With no other way to regain control, Kirk threatens to destroy the Enterprise, and begins the ship’s auto-destruct sequence. In the last seconds of the countdown, Bele relents, and the ship resumes its course to Ariannus.
As Bele continues angrily to press his matter with Starfleet, he reveals the source of his conflict with Lokai. Like himself, all of Bele's people on Cheron are black on their right sides, while Lokai's people are all white on their right sides. The distinction is lost on the ship's officers, who query whether the original Cheronians were monochromatic like the crew of the Enterprise, and leave the legal matter for authorities at the next starbase to decide, as the Federation has no extradition treaties with Cheron, and the case requires due process.
Once the Ariannus mission is completed, Bele takes control of the Enterprise again, this time disabling the self-destruct system. When the ship arrives at Cheron, Spock can find no sign of intelligent life. Lokai and Bele realize they are each the only ones left of their peoples, who have completely annihilated themselves in civil war. Enraged, they attack each other, their force fields threatening to damage the ship. Lokai breaks away, Bele pursues him, both traumatically envisioning their destroyed planet as they do so, and the two eventually beam down to the planet. The bridge crew remark sadly on their unwillingness to give up their hate.

Production[edit]
The script for the story was developed from a story outline written by Gene L. Coon under his pen name Lee Cronin. This was Gene Coon's final episode.[1]
Although Gene Roddenberry liked it, it was initially rejected by NBC studio executive Stanley Robertson.[2] The look of the aliens Bele and Lokai was decided only a week before filming began, based on an offhand comment by director Jud Taylor. The half white-half black makeup led to criticism of the episode as heavy-handed.[3]
The script evolved from an outline by Barry Trivers[4] for a possible first season episode called "A Portrait in Black and White". The script was accepted for the third season following budget cuts.[2]
"Let That Be Your Last Battlefield" is significant in the Star Trek universe for the first appearance of a self-destruct system (as opposed to an improvised self-destruction process). It did not originate the concept, which appeared previously in the film Forbidden Planet (1956), but the self-destruct system has appeared as a plot device in many subsequent Star Trek stories. The self-destruction sequence codes 11A, 11A2B, 1B2B3 and the final code 000 destruct-0 from the episode were used again verbatim in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock to destroy Enterprise in that film.

Reception[edit]
In 2010, SciFiNow ranked this the ninth best episode of the original series.[5]
Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a "C+" rating, noting positively the aliens' makeup and some "good moments", but also noting that these were outweighed by an overpowering message.[6] In their compendium of Star Trek reviews, Trek Navigator, Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross both rated the episode as mediocre, describing its message as obvious and heavy-handed. They did find some redeeming moments, such as the climactic chase to the ruined planet's surface and Gorshin's performance as Bele.[7] This episode is noted as one of the top ten Star Trek episodes that takes on the topic of tolerance.[8]
In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter rated "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield" the 11th best television episode of all Star Trek franchise television shows prior to Star Trek: Discovery including live-action and animated series but not counting the movies.[9]
A 2016 article in The New Yorker noted that this episode was a dramatization about slavery and racism.[10]
In 2017, ScreenRant ranked "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield" the 7th most optimistic episode of Star Trek television, pointing out the crew's reaction at the end.[11]
In 2016, SyFy ranked guest stars Frank Gorshin and Lou Antonio (as Bele and Lokai, the black and white aliens), the 10th best guest stars on the original series.[12]
In 2018, Collider ranked this episode the 12th best original series episode.[13]
In 2018, PopMatters ranked this the 19th best episode of the original series.[14]
In 2020, ScreenRant ranked it as the 10th best episode of TOS to re-watch.[15] They note that as the two characters are introduced, each appears half-black and half-white, but the Enterprise crew does not understand the feud between the two characters.[15]

Releases[edit]
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, Star Trek: Original Series log.3.[16] A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks.[16] The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン [16]
This episode was included in TOS Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.[17]

The gift to Prince William County’s School Board stipulated that this land would be used for building a public school for white children which opened to students on December 8, 1953. [2]
The principal is Matthew Mathison. Before coming to Gar-Field, he was an assistant principal at Woodbridge Senior High School. He has been principal since 2019.[3]

Merogomphus longistigma tamaracherriensis Fraser, 1931



Merogomphus tamaracherriensis[1] is a species of large dragonfly in the family Gomphidae. It is endemic to the forest streams of Western Ghats of India.[2][3][4][5]

Description and habitat[edit]
It is a large dragonfly with bottle-green eyes. Its thorax is black, marked with bright yellow. Sides are greenish-yellow traversed by two closely parallel black stripes. Abdomen is black, marked with bright yellow.[4][5]
Fraser described this dragonfly as a race or subspecies of Merogomphus longistigma in 1931.  He differentiated it from M. longistigma longistigma by the colour of the occiput and abdominal markings, as well as by its smaller size. The occiput entirely black here whereas greenish yellow in M. longistigrna longistigma. The mid-dorsal spot on segment 3 is isolated, and entirely absent on segments 4 to 6. There is a narrow mid-dorsal stripe in segment 3 to 6 in M. longistigrna longistigma.[4][5]
There is a mid-dorsal tiny diamond-shaped spot on the base of Segment 8. Segments 9 and 10 usually unmarked; but sometimes marked with a fine mid-dorsal streak on 9 and a tiny mid-dorsal apical point of yellow on 10.[5]
As advised by D. E. Kimmins, Fraser revised this species in 1953. He figured out that the anal appendages differ rather widely from those of M. longistigma. The anal appendages of M. longistigma are decidedly depressed for the distal half and the apices turn sharply upwards. In M. tamaracherriensis, the base slopes sharply away on the inner side so that the fenestra is diamond-shaped.[1]

It is commonly found in marshlands, bogs or streams at the foot of hills.[5]

LocationKoblenz StadtmitteLocation within Rhineland-Palatinate
Koblenz Stadtmitte station (German: Haltepunkt Koblenz Stadtmitte, freely translated as "Koblenz City Centre station") was opened on 14 April 2011 on the West Rhine Railway (German: Linke Rheinstrecke) in central Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland Palatinate. The main purpose of this station is to improve public transport access to central Koblenz because it is more convenient than Koblenz Hauptbahnhof (main station). In addition, it played an essential role as the station serving the Federal Horticultural Show 2011 in Koblenz.


Location[edit]
Koblenz Stadtmitte is classified as a Haltepunkt, which means a station that is not a rail junction and has no sets of points. It is centrally located in the Koblenz city centre, right behind the Löhr-Center shopping centre, and near the pedestrian zone. There is also a bus station in the same shopping centre near the station, with a direct bus connection to almost every district of Koblenz.[4]
In the second half of the 19th century there had been an earlier station near the modern station on today's Fischelstraße. It was called the Rhenish station (Rheinischer Bahnhof, after the Rhenish Railway Company, its builder) and was on the West Rhine Railway, running from Cologne to Bingerbrück. In 1902, it was replaced by the current Koblenz Hauptbahnhof.[5]

History[edit]
Opening of the station by Mayor Joachim Hofmann-Göttig on 14 April 2011
Already in the 1930s there were proposals for a station near the centre of the city. However, these were not pursued. This idea was raised again in the late 1970s and plans were developed. Despite considerable debate a decision to build the station was not taken until 2005.[6] A major factor in this decision was the selection of Koblenz as the site for the Federal Horticultural Show 2011. Preliminary work began in January 2008.[7] Before the start of work on the station, the westernmost of the three tracks had to be moved about five metres to the west for a length of about 300 metres to make room for the platform. Subsequently, construction started on a central platform for tracks 2 and 3 and an outside platform for track 1. On 14 April 2011, a day before the start of the Federal Horticultural Show, operations started at the station.
In 2005, it was estimated that the station would cost €9.1 million, but it ended up costing about €18.5 million.[8] The state of Rhineland-Palatinate provided about €9.1 million of this.[9]

Services[edit]
Koblenz Stadtmitte has three platform tracks, consisting of a side platform on track 1 and a central platform between tracks 2 and 3. The platforms are designed for trains with a length of 180 metres. Access to the platforms is barrier-free and the platforms have a height of 76 cm to provide barrier-free access to trains. The station is served by four services. It is served by Regional-Express line 5 services, running between Koblenz and Emmerich, and Regionalbahn 26 services, running between Koblenz and Cologne-Deutz. These two services use tracks 1 and 2. Track 3 is used by RB 10 services in both directions between Neuwied and Frankfurt am Main. RB 27 services also stop on track 3 in both directions, running on the right bank route (East Rhine Railway) through Neuwied between Koblenz and Cologne.

Cold Heaven First editionAuthorBrian MooreCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishPublisherMcClelland & StewartPublication date1983Pages265ISBN978-0-03-063257-0OCLC8907243Preceded byThe Temptation of Eileen Hughes  (1981) Followed byBlack Robe (1985) 
Cold Heaven is a novel by Northern Irish-Canadian writer Brian Moore. It was published in 1983.


Plot[edit]
The novel is set in Nice, New York and Carmel, California.[1] The plot concerns a lapsed Catholic, Marie Davenport, who is about to leave her husband Alex for her lover, Daniel, when Alex is apparently killed in a boating accident and then seems to have risen from the dead. The novel details Marie's dilemma in confronting this apparent miracle.

Autobiographical reference[edit]
Alex's accident references an event in Moore's own life. In 1956, he was hit by a motorboat while swimming in a lake in Canada and sustained multiple fractures to his skull.[2]

Reception[edit]
Frances Taliaferro, reviewing the book for The New York Times, described Cold Heaven as "a chilly disappointment, a cheerless novel". She said "Brian Moore's intentions for this novel are unclear. It begins with promising urgency and looks as if it will turn into a psychological thriller, but the initial suspense declines into anticlimax. To readers who are already disposed to believe in miracles, the Carmel sections may be gratifying, but the unconverted will find neither a satisfying exploration of the psychology of visions nor a fully realized portrait of the sinner who becomes God's unwilling agent."[3]
The title and metaphysical implications of Cold Heaven, according to Hallvard Dahlie, reflect W B Yeats's continuing influence on Moore. There are, he says, "many echoes of his earlier novels, in its settings of Nice, New York and Carmel, and in its exploitation of such recurring concerns as marital infidelity, guilt and the day-to-day conflicts between faith and disbelief, between free will and various forms of determinism... Our capitulation at the outset to the basic elements of the 'thriller' story... is soon reinforced by our involvement with Marie's metaphysical and spiritual dilemmas, and we are not entirely certain whether she is free at the end, or whether she is still to be, as Yeats states in his poem of the same title, 'stricken by the injustice of the skies for punishment'".[1]
Kirkus Reviews said: "this intriguing, half-satisfying novel is finally an entertainment, a theological Twilight Zone episode, a modernized Bernadette of Lourdes--instead of the electrifying parable that a French writer, a Mauriac or a Leon Bloy, say, might have made out of the premises and tensions of the same material."[4]

Film adaptation[edit]
The novel was made into a film in 1991. Directed by Nicolas Roeg, the adaptation stars Theresa Russell as Marie, Mark Harmon as Alex and James Russo as Daniel. The screenplay was written by Allan Scott.

Molly Peters (15 March 1939 – 30 May 2017),[1] born Vivien Mollie Rudderham, was an English actress and model best known for her role as Bond girl Patricia Fearing in the James Bond film Thunderball.


Career[edit]
Molly Peters started out as a model and was discovered by film director Terence Young.
She appeared in several films during the 1960s. Her best-known appearance was the role of Bond girl, Patricia Fearing or Pat, a nurse who takes care of James Bond (Sean Connery) while he is on holiday at her health clinic in Thunderball (1965).[2][3] Peters was the first Bond girl to be seen taking her clothes off on screen in the Bond series.[4]
Peters appeared in Playboy, in the November 1965 issue. Her appearance was as part of a pictorial essay titled "James Bond's Girls", by Richard Maibaum.[5]
According to the special edition DVD of Thunderball, Peters' short film career was the result of a disagreement between her and her agent.[6] The specifics of the disagreement were not revealed, other than according to Peters, her agent at the time of Thunderball held her to her contract agreement of representation because of the mega-successful box-office hit of the fourth James Bond film in 1965. It was only many years later, when the fame, the glamour and the chaos from the release of Thunderball had faded, that her contractual agreement ended; and so had any modelling and/or film prospects.

Personal life[edit]
When she was young, she gave birth to a daughter, whom she gave up for adoption. Peters later married and lived with her husband in Ipswich, Suffolk. She and her husband had a son, who has since died. In 2011, Peters suffered a mild stroke.[7]

Death[edit]
Peters died on 29 May 2017, at the age of 78 at Taunton Hospital, Somerset.[8][7]

Greeks in Serbia number 690 people according to the 2022 census[1] (up from 572 in the 2002 census),[3] and they are recognized as a national minority by the Serbian government.[3] Many of them are not in the census because it was difficult to them reach the administration.An estimation by the Association of Greeks in Serbia has the number of Serbs of Greek descent at 4,500 people. They are mostly concentrated in four Serbian cities: Belgrade, Smederevo, Niš and Novi Sad. Greek presence is also recorded in Sombor, Pančevo, Subotica, Kragujevac, Požarevac, Bor, Bački Petrovac and Zrenjanin. Many Greeks added the Slavic ending "ić", "ski" or "ev" to their surnames as an assimilation process in SFR Yugoslavia.[4] The first association of Greeks in Serbia was formed in 1923 under the name "Riga od Fere". The first Serb-Greek friendship society was formed in 1934 by Pavle Karađorđević,[5] the friendship society now has over 2,500 members in Serbia.
No illiteracy is recorded among the Greek minority. On occupation, 57.17% are workers, 26.4% are professional workers, 20.2% are professionals and 12.4% are legislators, officials and managers.[6]


History[edit]
Middle Ages[edit]
Main article: History of Serbia
During the Early Middle Ages, Serbia was a subject of the Byzantine Empire. The ethnogenesis of Serbs began in the Byzantine-Slavic environment, part of the wider Byzantine commonwealth. In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Serbs began fighting for independence, revolting against the Byzantines. In the following centuries, Serbia was independent and was mostly in friendly relations with Byzantium. Most of the queen consorts were Byzantine women (such as Eudokia Angelina, Simonida, Maria Palaiologina, Irene Kantakouzene, Helena Palaiologina). Some Byzantine families found refuge in Serbia at the end of the 14th and early 15th century, following Ottoman conquests, such as the Angeloi and Kantakouzenos; notable statesmen in the Serbian Despotate of Greek origin include Janja Kantakouzenos, Dimitrije Kantakuzin and Mihailo Anđelović.

Modern history[edit]
Main article: History of modern Serbia
The first mention of a Greek school in Serbia was in 1718, with Stephanos Daskalos as a teacher at Belgrade. The Greek schools were much respected and were attended by children of famous Serbs. The Greek schools invited language teachers from Greece to teach at primary and secondary schools wherever there was a Greek community such as Karlovac, Smederevo, Zemun, Belgrade, Požarevac, Kragujevac, Novi Sad, Šabac and others. Serbian Patriarch Kalinik II (1765-1766) was an ethnic Greek, and played a crucial role in the Ottoman abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć in 1766.

Several Aromanian families (from Macedonia) were held captives by the Bulgarians in 1916 in Bulgarian-occupied Požarevac (In Serbia) and stayed until 1918 when the Bulgarian front was breached and they returned to Greece.[7] They worked at the Serbs' vineyards and in the homes of the Jewish merchant-families. However, a number of Greeks remained in Požarevac, who were involved chiefly in commerce and in hotel enterprises, and with great success at that. Some of them became renowned, rich and eminent citizens of the city. Especially as owners of kafeneia (coffee shops), hotels. They gave Greek names to their kafeneia, such as "Itia" (willow tree) or "Kleousa" (weeping willow), "Ta Dyo Lefka Peristeria" (The Two White Doves), or "Kasine". The Greeks and Serbs were Orthodox Christians, and consequently their co-habitation was very good. Very frequently, and early on, weddings between Serbs and Greeks. With the passage of time, the second and third generations of the Greek settlers lost the Greek language, mainly because the Greeks were not living isolated or in groups, but very quickly assimilated into the wider Serbian society.[8]
In May 1945, 4,650 Greek refugees, mostly male members of ELAS, settled in the Maglić village with the help of Yugoslav government. From 1945 to 1948, it was a sui generis case of Greek extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Yugoslav conflict with informbiro saw the Greek community divided between loyalty to Yugoslavia and the Comintern, and those who supported the latter left the country. The remaining 800 also emigrated to Greek Macedonia eventually, with only a few remaining.
Greek politicians and organizations backed Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars. Greek volunteers fought alongside the Serbs in the Greek Volunteer Guard, a company of the Army of the Republika Srpska (ВРС, VRS).

Following the Kosovo declaration of independence[edit]
The Greek minority living in Serbia have turned to Greece to not recognize the unilateral secession in Kosovo by the Kosovo Albanians. They stated that the independence of Kosovo would endanger the stability in the Balkans and weaken the traditional Serbian-Greek relations.

...We, Greeks in Serbia, feel concern over the fact that the Greek government has remained silent regarding the self-proclamation of the fake state of Kosovo... We appeal to Greece to not destroy everything honorable and good - which it has done until now by supporting a devoted friend and ally in this region.[9]
The appeal adds that a wrong decision in the matter by the Greek government would "ruin what has taken a long time to build between the two countries".

Culture[edit]
The Greek-Serbian families has their own name day. Mixed Serb-Greeks celebrate the Slava (Serbian patron saint veneration) and they all celebrate Annunciation.
The Greek Foreign Ministry asserts that marriages between Serbs and Greeks living in Serbia are quite common, and that this is  both a cause and result of the close bonds shared by many Greeks and Serbs.[10]

Main article: Avro Vulcan
The Avro Vulcan is a British jet-engine strategic bomber operated by the Royal Air Force from 1956 until 1984. Of the 134 production Vulcans built, 19 survive today. None are airworthy, although three (XH558, XL426 and XM655) are in taxiable condition. All but four survivors are located in the United Kingdom. Of the four  Vulcans deployed in Operation Black Buck during the Falklands War – XM597, XM598, XM607 and XM612 – all survive today.

Surviving aircraft[edit]
All locations are in the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.

XH558

Doncaster, South Yorkshire

Robin Hood Airport

The last airworthy Vulcan (XH558) was restored to flying condition by the Vulcan to the Sky Trust. The first post-restoration flight, which lasted 34 minutes, took place on 18 October 2007.[1][2] After performing displays every season from 2008 until 2015 inclusive, XH558 last flew on 28 October 2015.[3] This was due to the withdrawal of support from the "technical authorities" without whom the aircraft is prohibited from flying, under Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations. The aircraft structure and systems are 10% beyond the flying hours of any other Vulcan, meaning identifying signs of fatigue and stress failure were becoming more difficult.[4]




XJ823

Irthington, Cumbria

Solway Aviation Museum

The 22nd B.2, later converted for the MMR role. Completed 20 April 1961, delivered to 27 Squadron a day later. Latterly with 50 Squadron and then Station Flight, Waddington. It was sold on 21 January 1983 to Tom Stoddard and David Hutchinson of the Solway Aviation Society, which at the time had only one other aircraft, a Meteor jet. Last flight was its arrival into Carlisle Airport in January 1983. Now stored in the open air, as part of the seasonal museum.[5][6][7]




XJ824

Duxford, Cambridgeshire

Imperial War Museum Duxford

Completed 11 May 1961, delivered to 27 Squadron five days later. Latterly with 101 Squadron. Flew into Duxford on 13 March 1982. Displayed inside Hangar 1, then outside while it was redeveloped as Airspace, moving back inside on completion.[8]




XL318

Colindale, London

Royal Air Force Museum London

The first B.2 delivered to 617 Squadron, The Dam Busters, based at RAF Scampton, on 1 September 1961. Performed its last flight (and last of the 617 as a Vulcan unit) on 11 December 1981, filmed for Yorkshire Television's 617-The Last Days of a Vulcan Squadron. Withdrawn and allocated to the RAF Museum on 4 January 1982, delivered by road from Scampton to Hendon in sections, being reassembled in the Bomber Command Museum (now Bomber Hall) by June 1982.[9][10]




XL319

Sunderland, Tyne and Wear

North East Aircraft Museum

The second B.2 delivered to 617 Squadron based at RAF Scampton, on 20 October 1961. Delivered from RAF Waddington to Sunderland Airport (the former RAF Usworth) on 21 January 1983, the largest aircraft ever to land on the site, performing a small display. Displayed outside as part of the adjacent museum's collection. After the airport was closed on 31 May 1984 (the runway being built over for the Nissan car factory), it was moved with the rest of the museum's collection to an adjacent site, still displayed in the open air, with cockpit tours on certain days.[11][12]




XL360

Baginton, Warwickshire

Midland Air Museum

Completed 28 February 1962, delivered to 617 squadron on 2 March. Latterly with 101 Squadron. it was sold to the MAM on 26 January 1983. Delivered to the MAM's site on the north side of Coventry Airport on 4 February, then moved with the rest of their collection a short distance away by 1990, where it is on display in the open air. Cockpit opened daily to visitors. Named City of Coventry in preservation, in recognition of the city's funding the aircraft's purchase.[13]




XL361

Goose Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada

CFB Goose Bay

Completed 14 March 1962, being delivered to 617 Squadron the next day. Latterly with 9 Squadron, due to a fire in the fuselage during a trans-Atlantic flight from Woodford to Offutt AFB in Nebraska, XL361 had to make an emergency landing at CFB Goose Bay on 13 November 1981, site of an RAF unit and used regularly as a Vulcan exercise base. With the fleet being retired, it was not repaired, instead being positioned as the RAF unit's gate guardian. At the request of the mayor of the adjacent town of Happy Valley, the RAF gifted it to the community on 14 June 1982, on condition it was displayed within the locality in a dignified manner in RAF colours, with any future changes in its status to be agreed with the British government. Presented to the Labrador Heritage Society Museum in 1983 but remaining at the airbase, which doubles as a civilian airport, it is still displayed in the open air.[14][15][16]




XL426

Southend-on-Sea, Essex

Southend Airport

XL426 (G-VJET) is preserved in taxiable condition at Southend Airport, England.[17]




XM573

Ashland, Nebraska, United States

Strategic Air and Space Museum

The 101st Vulcan produced, delivered in March 1963. Donated by the RAF to the museum adjacent to Offutt Air Force Base, Bellevue, Nebraska, in 1982 as a token of the links between the RAF and the US Strategic Air Command, based at Offutt. Its last flight was a display at Offutt during its handover, as part of the closing ceremony of the RAF detachment at the base, which also featured three other Vulcans, plus flypasts by a USAF trio of the B-52, KC-135 and FB-111, the types flown against by Vulcans in RAF-SAC bombing competitions. Moved to the museum just outside the base perimeter the next day, it was displayed outside until the relocation of the museum to Ashland, Nebraska in 1998, moving indoors. Moved outside in 2015 due to lack of space.[18] As of September 2022, XM573 is back inside and located in the Durham Restoration Hangar.




XM575

Castle Donington, Leicestershire

East Midlands Aeropark

Delivered to 617 squadron in May 1963. Took part in the Falklands War victory flypast over London on 28 October 1982. Last flight was its delivery to East Midlands Airport in January 1983, being given the civilian registration G-BLMC. Displayed outside in the Aeropark museum, a volunteer museum run on behalf of the airport, on its boundary. Preparations were made in 1983 to fly it to a planned museum at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome recently purchased by the Walton family (eventual owners of XH558 from 1993), although the move never took place as EMA society's funds ran out before it could be made airworthy. Moved once, when the aeropark was moved from one side of the airport to the other. Three of four engines were periodically run until the move to the new location where noise restrictions are in place.[19][20][21]




XM594

Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire

Newark Air Museum

The penultimate Vulcan built, completed on 9 July 1963 and delivered to 27 Squadron ten days later. A 1982 permission for a Vulcan to be sold to the volunteer-run NAM was initially delayed by the Falklands War, and then refused because their runway at the former RAF Winthorpe, now Winthorpe Showground, was deemed unsafe to land a Vulcan. It had never received such a heavy aircraft, or any kind of jet. The decision was reversed after remedial works, on the basis that one Vulcan needed to be retained in the local area (to Waddington). Latterly with 44 Squadron, it became the first Vulcan earmarked for preservation to be paid for, bought by Stuart Stephenson on 19 January 1983, and the only one to be delivered to a non-licensed UK airfield. Its last flight was its delivery from Waddington on 7 February 1983, complete with a display cut short by an arriving blizzard. Displayed outside and regularly powered up until the 2000s, when Health & Safety rules prohibited further use. Sold to the Lincolnshire Lancaster Association (its chairman being the original purchaser) in early 2004, and loaned back to the NAM. Cockpit tours by appointment.[22][23][24]




XM597

East Fortune, East Lothian

National Museum of Flight

Completed on 26 August 1963, it was delivered to 12 Squadron the next day. Along with XM607, one of only two Vulcans to have dropped bombs on an enemy target, both during Black Buck missions. XM597 set the record for the longest bombing raid in Black Buck 5, and causing an international incident when it had to divert to Brazil in Black Buck 6, both feats commemorated with two mission markings and a Brazilian flag painted on the nose. Latterly with 50 Squadron. it was delivered to the museum on 12 April 1984. Displayed outside Hangar 1.[25][26][27]




XM598

Cosford, Shropshire

Royal Air Force Museum Cosford

Completed on 30 August 1963, it was delivered to 12 Squadron at RAF Coningsby on 4 September. Was the originally designated bombing aircraft for Black Buck 1, but which had to turn back minutes into the flight. Withdrawn with disbandment of 44 Squadron, the last bomber unit, on 21 December 1982. Performed its last flight on 20 January 1983, being delivered to Aerospace Museum Cosford, incorporating a final display over the museum. Displayed outside until relocation into the new National Cold War Exhibition building in May 2006, opening 8 February 2007.[28][29][30]




XM603

Woodford, Greater Manchester

Woodford Aerodrome

Completed 29 November 1963, it was delivered to 9 Squadron on 4 December. Latterly with 44 Squadron, it was the test-bed aircraft for the K2 tanker conversions. later being sold to British Aerospace for preservation, being delivered to Woodford on 12 March 1983. Some parts removed for support of XH558, XM655 and XL426. It is now owned by Harrow Estates that purchased the airfield from Avro Heritage Ltd. The Vulcan has now been restored by 47 members of the Avro Heritage museum, being unveiled on 25 October 2016. It is repainted in its anti-flash white livery with black radome and tail.[31]




XM605

Atwater, California, United States

Castle Air Museum

Completed on 17 December 1963, it was delivered to 9 Squadron on 30 December. Latterly with 50 Squadron. it was donated to the United States Air Force in 1981, being delivered to Castle AFB on 2 September and formally handed over six days later.[32]




XM606

Bossier City, Louisiana, United States

Barksdale Global Power Museum

Completed on 18 December 1963, it was delivered to 12 Squadron on the 30 December. Latterly with 9 Squadron. It was donated to the United States Air Force, being delivered to Barksdale AFB on 7 June 1982 and formally handed over on 14 June 1983.[33]




XM607

Waddington, Lincolnshire

RAF Waddington

Completed on 30 December 1963, it was delivered to 35 Squadron on New Year's Day 1964. XM607 was the bombing aircraft in Operation Black Buck, raids one, two and seven. Latterly with 44 Squadron, it was withdrawn on 17 December 1982 and became a static exhibit alongside the Waddington runway.[34]




XM612

Horsham St Faith, Norfolk

City of Norwich Aviation Museum

Completed on 28 February 1964 by A.V. Roe Co. at Woodford, Manchester, she was delivered to 9 Squadron on 3 March 1964. During the Falklands conflict of 1982, she was one of 5 airframes selected to reposition to Ascension Island to bomb the runway at Port Stanley. She was due to be the lead Vulcan on the 3rd Black Buck raid on 13 May 1982, however the mission was cancelled due to strong headwinds. After her return to RAF Waddington in December 1982, she was decommissioned and was sold to the City of Norwich Aviation Museum for the total sum of £5026 on 19 January 1983, being delivered on 30 January.[35]




XM655

Wellesbourne, Warwickshire

Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield

XM655 (G-VULC) was the antepenultimate Vulcan to be built, and is the youngest surviving example, preserved in taxiable condition at Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield by the 655 Maintenance & Preservation Society. XM655 initially flew with 9 Squadron, and was also operated by Nos. 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons. In 1984, XM655 was sold off to Roy Jacobsen who intended to keep her airworthy, but the costs proved prohibitive and also the runway was too short for it to take off, and XM655 was left to deteriorate. Title of XM655 then passed onto John Littler, owner of Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield, who intended to get her to a taxiable condition, but not airworthy. As well as MaPS maintaining it, the 150 City of Oxford Air Cadets helps to maintain it.[citation needed] After restoration work, XM655 made her first public taxi run on 16 February 1997, with another two runs later that year. Since then, XM655 has made more or less annual public taxi runs, usually in June, as part of the Wellesbourne Wings and Wheels show. At various of these events, the display of XM655 has been accompanied by flypasts by the BBMF, the Red Arrows and Vulcan XH558. XM655 was also used by the crews of XH558 as required for currency and ground training.[36]

Matukutūreia (also McLaughlins Mountain) is one of the volcanic cones in the Auckland volcanic field. It has a peak 73 metres above sea level, and was the site of a pā. The scoria cone was originally crescent-shaped and featured Māori terraces and kumara pits, before extensive quarrying reduced it to a pyramid-shaped mound big enough to support the summit water tank for Papatoetoe. A small part of the summit and the eastern side of the cone were left unquarried, plus a large area of lava flows to the south of the cone remains intact. These remaining parts have recently been transferred to Department of Conservation Management, primarily because of the high heritage values of the Matukuturua Stonefields gardens.
Matukutūreia and nearby Wiri Mountain are collectively known as Matukurua (also Ngā Matukurua).[2]
From July to September 2010, the water tank was removed from the top of Matukutūreia, as part of an agreement when the land was handed over to the Department of Conservation.


Geology[edit]
Matukutūreia is a spatter cone associated with the Matukuturua lava field,[1]: 15  and has geophysical features that raised the possibility of it being a rootless cone, with no apparent gravitational or magnetic evidence of a residual lava conduit but a uniform best-fit magnetic declination of about 20° west implying a short eruption.[3] Rootless cones can form when a lava flow flows over a localised water accumulation but the surface of the lava flow solidifies allowing continuing explosive tephra eruptions from the interactions of heat, lava and steam to form a cone.[4] Later work by the same group clarified that Matukutūreia itself had a 140 nT peak to peak magnetic anomaly, but four eruption craters to its west and south-west towards the Puhinui Reserve are not associated with any magnetic anomaly.[5] One of these the Matukuturua explosion crater is within the Matukuturua lava field and only 500 m (1,600 ft) from Matukutūreia was definitely formed by a single steam event.[1]: 15  This is consistent with the observations elsewhere on the mechanism of rootless cone formation but also in the case of the explosion crater a phreatic eruption scenario where magma never reaches the surface.[1]: 15  The three Puhinui Craters are maar structures and also could have the same origin but this is not known to be the case. The source of the Matukuturua lava is assigned to the extensively quarried Matukutūreia, which therefore has a root, and the Matukuturua crater has been incorporated in the reserve area as a result of these unusual properties for an Auckland volcanic field crater.[1]: 22

Menostanes (/məˈnɒstəniːz/; died 423 BC) was a Persian prince, son of Artarius, the satrap of Babylonia and thus nephew of king Artaxerxes I.
Around 445 BC he commanded the Persian army against the rebel satrap Megabyzus, but was defeated as was the previous commander, Usiris. A peace was signed c. 444 BC with Megabyzus after negotiations in which his father Artarius took part.
Artaxerxes I died in 423 BC and was succeeded by his son Xerxes II, who, 45 days later, was murdered by his half-brother Sogdianus, Menostanes and the eunuch Pharnacyas. Sogdianus became king and named Menostanes as his prime minister and chief of the army. However, Sogdianus was later defeated and put to death by Ochus, a brother of Xerxes II, who took the throne and changed his name to Darius II. Pharnacyas was stoned to death and Menostanes committed suicide.
Apart from Ctesias, there are no classical sources on Menostanes, but he appears to be mentioned in some cuneiform tablets of the Murashu family from the Babylonian city of Nippur, in which he is called Manuštånu. The Murashu Archive suggests that Menostanes owned large estates near Nippur.  In 423 BC, Menostanes' domains passed to Artahšar, who has been identified with Artoxares, a supporter of Darius II.

John Davie BurgessBorn(1934-03-11)11 March 1934Aberdeen, ScotlandDied29 June 2005(2005-06-29) (aged 71)Inverness, ScotlandInstrument(s)BagpipesMusical artist
John Davie Burgess MBE (11 March 1934 – 29 June 2005) was a Scottish bagpipe player.


Life[edit]
He was born in Aberdeen on 11 March 1934, and first learned to play the practice chanter at the age of four from his father John, who was also a piper.[1]
The family moved to Edinburgh when the elder John took up a lecturing position at the Veterinary School.[2] John D. was educated Edinburgh Academy, and tutored by Pipe major Willie Ross of the Army School of Bagpipe Music and Highland Drumming at Edinburgh Castle.[2] He did not play in the school band, for fear that it would damage his technique.[2]
In 1950 he became the youngest ever winner of the gold medals for piobaireachd at both the Argyllshire Gathering in Oban and the Northern Meeting in Inverness, at the age of 16.[3][2] He initially intended to pursue piping as a hobby, and pursue a career training horses, but he went on a tour of Canada and the United States with Willie Ross in 1952.[4] Burgess was persuaded by Brigadier Alistair MacLean at the Castle to join the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders as a piper, and spent three years there, reaching the rank of corporal.[4][2] His choice of regiment did not please Ross, who wanted him to join the Scots Guards.[1]
Burgess then joined the Edinburgh City Police, and became pipe major of that band in 1957.[5]
Between 1962 and 1965, he was pipe major of the 4th/5th Battalion Cameron Highlanders TA Pipe Band.[2] He then moved to Invergordon in 1966, and played with the Invergordon Distillery Pipe Band for two years, until it was disbanded in 1967.[1][6]
Burgess became a teacher and judge after retiring from competitive playing in around 1979, teaching in schools around Easter Ross.[7][3][1] He was awarded an MBE in 1988 for services to piping.[2]
He died on 29 June 2005, and was survived by his wife Sheila and their son, John, and daughter, Margaret.[2][8]

Dunbartonshire (Scottish Gaelic: Siorrachd Dhùn Breatann)[1] or the County of Dumbarton is a historic county, lieutenancy area and registration county in the west central Lowlands of Scotland lying to the north of the River Clyde. Dunbartonshire borders Perthshire to the north, Stirlingshire to the east, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire to the south, and Argyllshire to the west.
The county covered a similar area to the earldom and later duchy of Lennox. The historic county gives its name to two of Scotland's modern council areas, being East Dunbartonshire and West Dunbartonshire.


Name[edit]
Looking across the River Clyde towards Dumbarton Castle
The town name "Dumbarton" comes from the Scottish Gaelic Dùn Breatainn meaning "fort of the Britons".[2] Historically, the spelling of the county town and the county were not standardised. By the 18th century the names "County of Dunbarton" and "County of Dumbarton" were used interchangeably.[3] The n in "Dunbarton" represents the etymology Dùn "fort"; the "m" in "Dumbarton" reflects a pronunciation with assimilation of /n/ to the labial /m/, due to the influence of the neighbouring labial /b/ sound.[4]
Different county bodies used the two spellings: the Dunbarton County Constabulary were formed in 1857 by the Commissioners of Supply for the County of Dunbarton.[5]
In 1890 elected county councils were established under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which referred to the area as the "County of Dumbarton". However, one of the county council's first acts was to adopt an official seal, for which it chose to use the spelling "Dunbarton", with an "n", as being closer to the name's etymology, despite protests from some residents who maintained that the spelling with an "m" was better established in general usage.[6][7] The town of Dumbarton continued to use the spelling with an "m". Statutory recognition of the spelling with an "n" being used for the county came with the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947.[8]

History[edit]
Dunbartonshire's origins as a shire (the area administered by a sheriff) are obscure, but it had become a shire by the end of the twelfth century. The shire of Dumbarton was initially similar in area to the earldom of Lennox, covering an area north of the River Clyde and around Loch Lomond. In the thirteenth century an area north-east of Loch Lomond was transferred to Stirlingshire, whilst the two parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were transferred from Stirlingshire to Dunbartonshire, despite not adjoining the rest of the county.[9] The changes were reversed in 1504, when Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld were restored to Stirlingshire and the area north-east of Loch Lomond came back to Dunbartonshire, but the change was short-lived, being reverted again in 1509.[9]

Dumbarton Sheriff Court and County Buildings
Commissioners of Supply were established in 1667 to act as the main administrative body for the shire outside the burghs. Elected county councils were established in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, taking most of the functions of the commissioners (which were eventually abolished in 1930). The burgh of Dumbarton was deemed capable of managing its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of the county council, although the county council still chose to base itself in that town.[10] The county council held its first meeting on 22 May 1890 at the County Buildings (which also served as the sheriff court) on Church Street in Dumbarton.[11][12] The 1889 act also led to a review of boundaries; in the case of Dunbartonshire the parish of New Kilpatrick had previously straddled Dunbartonshire and Stirlingshire, with the town of Milngavie being in the part of the parish in Stirlingshire. The parish was brought entirely within Dunbartonshire on 15 May 1891.[13][14]

County Buildings, Dumbarton
Reforms to local government in 1930 saw the burgh of Dumbarton brought within the administrative area of the county council. The county council was based at the old county buildings at the sheriff court until 1965, when it moved to new County Buildings on Garshake Road in Dumbarton. The new building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, on 28 June 1965 during a royal visit to the area.[15]
Dunbartonshire was abolished for local government purposes in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, becoming part of the large Strathclyde Region. Strathclyde was divided into nineteen districts, with Dunbartonshire being divided between Dumbarton, Bearsden and Milngavie, Clydebank, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and Strathkelvin Districts. The combined area of these five districts continued to be used as a lieutenancy area.[16]
Local government in Scotland was reorganised again in 1996, with the regions and districts abolished and replaced with unitary council areas. Two of the new council areas include Dunbartonshire in their name. Since 1996 the area of the pre-1975 county of Dunbartonshire has been split between four council areas:

East Dunbartonshire Council, with its administrative headquarters at Kirkintilloch (also includes parts of the pre-1975 counties of Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire).
West Dunbartonshire Council, with its administrative centre at Dumbarton.
Argyll and Bute Council (which took over the Helensburgh and Lomond part of Dumbarton District).
North Lanarkshire (for the Cumbernauld area).
The Dunbartonshire lieutenancy area continues to be defined in terms of the five districts that existed between 1975 and 1996, with the only change made to the lieutenancy areas at the time of the 1996 local government reorganisation being that the Chryston area of Strathkelvin district was transferred to the Lanarkshire lieutenancy.[17] The historic boundaries of Dunbartonshire are still used for land registration purposes, being a registration county.[18]

Geography[edit]
Loch Lomond as seen from the summit of the island of Inchcailloch to Torrinch, Creinch, Inchmurrin and Ben Bowie
The northern half of the county is sparsely populated and dominated by Loch Lomond (now part of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park), which it shares with Stirlingshire. There are many islands in the loch which form part of the county, the most notable being Island I Vow, Tarbet Isle, Inchlonaig, Inchconnachan, Inchmoan, Inchtavannach, Fraoch Eilean, Inchgalbraith, Torrinch, Creinch, Inchmurrin and Aber Isle. The much smaller Geal Loch, Lochan Beinn Damhain, Lochan Strath Dubh-uisge and Loch Sloy can also be found here. The area is also home to Ben Vorlich, the highest point of Dunbartonshire at 943 m (3,094 ft) and the 229th tallest mountain in Scotland.

Ben Vorlich, the tallest mountain in Dunbartonshire
South-western Dunbartonshire has a long coastline along Loch Long, culminating in the Rosneath peninsula which is separated from the main body of the county by Gare Loch. Both of these lead into the Firth of Clyde which forms the southern border. The area east of the river Leven is dominated geographically by the Kilpatrick Hills which also contains a number of small lochs and reservoirs. In the far south-east the county encompasses a portion of the Greater Glasgow conurbation.

The Cumbernauld exclave is largely flat and heavily urbanised.

Boundaries and the Cumbernauld exclave[edit]
The county retained a large exclave situated five miles (eight kilometres) east of the main part of the county despite the boundary changes in the 1890s elsewhere in Scotland, consisting of the civil parishes of Kirkintilloch and Cumbernauld, between Stirlingshire and Lanarkshire. This area had originally been part of Stirlingshire, but had been annexed to Dunbarton in the reign of David II at the request of Malcolm Fleming, Earl of Wigtown, the owner of the land, who was also Sheriff of Dumbarton.[19]
The exclave was dealt with in 19th century legislation as greater administrative duties were given to the counties.
The Police (Scotland) Act 1857 established police forces throughout Scotland. Section 70 of the act allowed for the parishes to be transferred to the jurisdiction of either Stirlingshire or Lanarkshire Constabulary on resolution of two-thirds of the Commissioners of Supply for the County of Dumbarton.[20]
Similar provisions allowing for the transfer of the area for all purposes were included in the County General Assessment (Scotland) Act 1868.[21] No such resolution was made, and the two parishes remained in Dunbartonshire.
Section 40 of the Roads and Bridges (Scotland) Act 1878 (41 & 42 Vict. c. 51) provided that for the purposes of that act all detached parts of counties should be placed in the county by which they were surrounded, or with which they had the longest boundary.[22] Accordingly, Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch came under the control of the Stirlingshire Road Board. It was originally anticipated that the area would be transferred to Stirlingshire for all other purposes by the boundary commissioners proposed by the Local Government Bill of 1889.[23] However, a clause was inserted in the bill that stated "the parishes of Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch, including the burghs and police burghs situate therein, shall for the purposes of this Act, be considered as forming part of the county of Dumbarton". The clause was vigorously opposed by the Stirlingshire Commissioners of Supply as they had incurred considerable expense in maintaining the roads of the two parishes. The Act as passed provided that the Dunbartonshire County Council was to financially compensate Stirlingshire on the transfer of road powers.[24]


Transport[edit]
The Firth of Clyde at Kilcreggan, with PS Waverley approaching across Loch Long
The West Highland Line runs through the county connecting Glasgow to Oban and Fort William and is popular with tourist due to its scenic view of the Highlands. The North Clyde line serves the towns of the Vale of Leven, and many suburban and commuter lines serve those parts of Dunbartonshire that form part of the Glasgow conurbation. Two lines run west–east through the Cumbernauld exclave, linking this area to Glasgow and Falkirk.
Various ferries criss-cross Loch Lomond, linking some of the towns along its banks. The Rosneath peninsula is connected by a ferry from Kilcreggan to Gourock in Renfrewshire.

Musical artist
James Leusink (born April 13, 1990), better known by his alias Ephixa (sometimes stylised as ephixa), is a Canadian electronic music producer who lives in Ontario, Canada. He is best known for his viral "Charlie Sheen Bi-Winning" dubstep remix, remixes of music from the Legend of Zelda franchise as well as various other remixes and original electronic music. Leusink peaked at #11 on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart in November 2011. Ephixa is also known for the first ever single released by Canadian record label Monstercat, "Dubstep Killed Rock 'n' Roll".


Early life[edit]
Leusink was born on April 13, 1990. His interest in music started when he was 8 years old, playing the keyboard without prior lessons. He got his first guitar several years later, began taking lessons, and joined various bands. Leusink's work in electronic music began while he was developing video games in his spare time, desired to create a soundtrack for his various games. Originally influenced by hardstyle artists such as Alphaverb, Showtek, and Evil Activities, Leusink has used the digital audio workstation FL Studio to produce his music.[1]

Career[edit]
2010 to 2011: Zelda Step, "Charlie Sheen Bi-Winning Dubstep", and "Sanctuary"[edit]
On April 10, 2010, Leusink released his second EP, Zelda Step. The project featured remixes of "Lost Woods", "Song of Storms" and "Gerudo Valley" from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, as well as a remix of "Dragon Roost Island" from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. The album received mixed to positive reviews, with Jade Royal of Sputnikmusic giving the EP a 3.5 out of 5 rating, stating "It's a thin line that Ephixa treads with 'Zelda Step', but one that ultimately pleases more than disdains".[3] Elton Jones of Complex later placed Leusink's remix of "Lost Woods" as the best remix of a video game theme song, finalising his review of the song with "The Legend of Zelda Lost Woods theme mixed with dubstep sounds incredible."[4]
On March 2, 2011, Leusink released "Charlie Sheen Bi-Winning Dubstep", a remix featuring footage of Charlie Sheen from an interview originally broadcast on American TV series 20/20.[5][6] Within two days of its release, the remix had been viewed over 700,000 times and received over 7,500 likes on YouTube, becoming one of the site's most popular and viral videos at the time.[7]
On September 19, 2011, Leusink released his dubstep remix of the song "Sanctuary", originally by English trance producer Gareth Emery. The remix was included in an extended play based on the original song, titled Sanctuary (The Remixes). When reviewing the extended play, a writer for DJ Mag commented on Leusink's remix, stating that he had gone for a "twitchy, spasmodic bit of dubstep-ery, which is ok, of the type".[8] In the week of November 5, 2011, Leusink entered and peaked at number 11 on Billboard's Next Big Sound chart.[9]

2012 to 2015: Monstercat, Hiatus, "Catfish", and "Machina"[edit]
On August 3, 2012, Leusink released "Awesome To The Max", which the Your EDM staff described as "heavy but laid back, and a gift for fans of dubstep and Monstercat alike". On August 25, Leusink collaborated with American producer Varien and Canadian duo Project 46 to release "The Anthem". The collaboration was released alongside an animated music video to celebrate Monstercat's one year anniversary. Both "Awesome To The Max" and "The Anthem" appeared on Monstercat's ninth compilation album, Monstercat 009 – Reunion.[10] Both songs were later featured on Monstercat's Best of 2012 compilation album.[11]

In November 2012, Leusink left Monstercat, continuing to release music independently. On November 16, he released "Fuck The System", a mashup of himself, Deadmau5, TVDS, and Showtek. The song was released to promote "Fuck the 9to5 jobs".[12] On January 17, 2013, Leusink released "Unraveled Reality", which Steve Jacobs of EDM Sauce wrote that the track "offers a bit of a soothing feel along with some big drum sounds".[13] In 2013, Leusink went on hiatus. During a Reddit AMA, The Monstercat staff were questioned about what happened to Leusink, which they answered:"Ephixa, as an artist, took some time off to focus on other projects and his personal life. However, word on the street is that he is back at producing and we are looking forward to hearing his new work."— Monstercat staff responding to a user about what happened to Leusink[14]
On June 30, 2014, a year after he released "Unraveled Reality" and almost two years after he released "The Anthem", Leusink independently released "Catfish". EDMTunes' James Brannigan noted the song for its minimalist trance progression, later writing that as soon as "the drop hits, Ephixa brings back the sound he used to win all of our hearts with as he did in his dubstep remix of 'Song of Storms'".[14]
On February 5, 2015, Leusink released his remix of American electronic producer Dex Arson's song "Machina" as part of the latter's extended play Welcome to War. Writing for EDMTunes, James Brannigan noted the remix for its diversity and described it as "bearing a resemblance to Excision’s style".[15] Matthew Meadow of Your EDM wrote that Luesink had transformed the original song into a "genre-hopping, deep and rumbling tune bound to blow your speakers", later stating that the synths used were "wonderfully bubbly and sinister at the same time, allowing for an extremely diverse and layered track, just the kind of thing I live for".[16]

2016 to 2017: Return to Monstercat and subsequent releases[edit]
Main article: Losing You (Ephixa and Laura Brehm song)
On July 4, 2016, nearly 4 years after his last release on Monstercat, Leusink collaborated with Stephen Walking to release "Matches" as part of Monstercat's 5 Year Anniversary, featuring Aaron Richards as vocals.[17] The collaboration was previously featured in Leusink's 2014 mini-mix Wip Rip Reel under the working title "Old Dennis". At the time, Leusink stated that the track would "most likely never" be finished.[18] The song was later voted by fans to be featured as part of Monstercat's Best of 2016 compilation album.[19]
On February 2, 2017, Leusink collaborated with Laura Brehm to release "Losing You" on Monstercat.[20][21] Billie-Darian Hollyhead of Playing With Sound called the song a "beautiful progressive house track", noting Brehms' vocals as "truly stunning as they lay on top of the oscillating beats".[22] The song was later featured as part of Monstercat's Best of 2017 compilation album.[23] On August 19, 2017, Leusink appeared on Laura Brehm's remix album Breathe EP Remixes.[24]
On July 5, 2017, Leusink released the song "Skyforth" as part of Rocket League x Monstercat Vol. 1, the first collaborative album between Monstercat and San Diego-based video game developer Psyonix. The song appeared in the in-game soundtrack of Psyonix's 2015 video game Rocket League, alongside 17 other songs by various artists including Slushii, Aero Chord, Vicetone, Tristam, and Rogue.[25]
On October 26, 2017, Leusink collaborated with Laura Brehm to release "Deja Vu" on the latter's own record label Electric Bird Records. Your EDM's Landon Fleury compared the song to Leusink's previous song "Skyforth", wring that the tack "sees Ephixa continuing down the house path in a similar way to his song 'Skyforth', but with a distinctly stronger groove and fresh vocal chops to top everything off". Fleury later noted Brehm's vocals as ones that "really soar, elevating the production to its maximum potential".[26]
On December 13, 2017, Leusink collaborated with electronic music producer Bossfight to release "Subside" on Monstercat. Writing for Your EDM, Landon Fleury wrote about the song's influences from various electronic dance music genres including chiptune, synthwave, bass house, and trap, stating that the song "sees Ephixa turning back to the heavier-leaning sound his musical career was founded on, diving into electro at full power" and concluding his review by writing "Simply said, it’s a variety of different sounds and styles that somehow fit together perfectly in the end".[27] The song was later featured on Monstercat Uncaged Vol. 4, the first compilation album released by Monstercat since their Uncaged and Instinct re-branding in January earlier in the year.[28] The song appeared on Monstercat's Best of 2018 compilation album.[29]

2018 to present: "Dreamstate", "Sundance", and Monstercat's 8 Year Anniversary Adventure[edit]
On August 10, 2018, Leusink released "Dreamstate" on Monstercat.[30] A writer of T.H.E - Music Essentials described the song as a refresh of Leusink's style, writing that the song production has been made "very thoughtfully and yet, allows one to freely flow through its rhythms."[31] The song was later featured as part of Monstercat's second Instinct series compilation album titled Monstercat Instinct Vol. 2, alongside 39 other songs by various artists, including The Night, Fwlr, Julian Calor, and Vicetone.[32]
On June 11, 2019, Leusink collaborated with electronic music producer Heartful to release the synthwave song "Sundance".[33] The song was later added to the video game Rocket League as part the second phase of the latter's Radical Summer in-game event.[34] Leusink and Heartful were joined by other Monstercat artists included in the update, including 7 Minutes Dead, Desert Star, Televisor, Tut Tut Child, Varien, and Wrld.[35]
On July 1, Leusink collaborated with Canadian DJ and Producer Going Quantum to release the drum and bass song "Let's Roll."[36] The next day, Leusink collaborated with Stephen Walking to release the song "Problems". Both songs were released as part of Monstercat's 8 Year Anniversary album, titled Monstercat's 8 Year Anniversary Adventure, released on July 12.[37]
On November 17, 2020, Animated electronic music duo Half an Orange released their extended play Mostly We Grow Pt. 3. Their electro-rock collaboration with Leusink, "Time Travel Kool Aid", was included as the first song on the extended play.[38]

Remains of the old bridge.
Podul Grant, as seen from Crângași toward Ion Mihalache Boulevard
Podul Grant (Grant Bridge) is a bridge that serves both motorway and lightrail transportation in Bucharest, Romania. It is named after Effingham Grant, the British consul in Bucharest during the mid-19th century. Initially, the bridge was made of steel, and opened in 1910. Between 1979 and 1982, the old bridge was mostly demolished, to make way for a brand new concrete one, with slip ramps and wider lanes. Since then, a number of maintenance and modernisation projects have been executed.
The bridge is located in the Giulești neighborhood of Sector 6 in the city. It serves as a route for tram way (line 41), which was upgraded while Traian Băsescu was mayor, becoming the first lightrail line in Bucharest.
Today, the bridge connects Crângași Square with Turda Street, crossing west–east over Giulești Boulevard, the railroads and Grivița Boulevard. It is one of the symbols of the football club București, its stadium being located right by the bridge.

"Arene" redirects here. For other uses, see Arene (disambiguation).
This article is missing information about Non-benzenoid aromatic compounds. Please expand the article to include this information. Further details may exist on the talk page. (October 2022)
2D model of a benzene molecule. The carbon "ring" is what makes benzene "aromatic".
Aromatic compounds or arenes usually refers to organic compounds "with a chemistry typified by benzene" and "cyclically conjugated."[1]
The word "aromatic" originates from the past grouping of molecules based on odor, before their general chemical properties were understood. The current definition of aromatic compounds does not have any relation to their odor. Aromatic compounds are now defined as cyclic compounds satisfying Hückel's Rule.[2]
Aromatic compounds have the following general properties:

Typically unreactive[2]
Often non polar and hydrophobic.[2]
High carbon-hydrogen ratio[2]
Burn with a strong sooty yellow flame, due to high C:H ratio[2]
Undergo electrophilic substitution reactions and nucleophilic aromatic substitutions[3]
Arenes are typically split into two categories - benzoids, that contain a benzene derivative and follow the benzene ring model, and non-benzoids that contain other aromatic cyclic derivatives.[2] Aromatic compounds are commonly used in organic synthesis and are involved in many reaction types, following both additions and removals, as well as saturation and dearomatization.


Heteroarenes[edit]
Heteroarenes are closely related aromatic compounds, where at least one methine or vinylene (-C= or -CH=CH-) group is replaced by a heteroatom: oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur.[4] Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are furan, a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and pyridine, a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom. Hydrocarbons without an aromatic ring are called aliphatic. Approximately half of compounds known in the year 2000 are described as aromatic to some extent.[5]

Electron flow through p orbitals for the heterocycle furan[6]
Line bond structure of the heterocycle pyridine[6]
Line bond structure of the heterocycle furan[6]
Applications[edit]
Aromatic compounds are pervasive in nature and industry. Key industrial aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene, toluene, Xylene called BTX.  Many biomolecules have phenyl groups including the so-called aromatic amino acids.

Benzene ring model[edit]
Main article: Aromaticity
Line bond structure of benzene[6]
Electron flow through p orbitals showing the aromatic nature of benzene[6]
Benzene, C6H6, is the least complex aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one defined as such.[7] Its bonding nature was first recognized independently by Joseph Loschmidt and August Kekulé in the 19th century.[7] Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One electron forms a sigma bond with the hydrogen atom, and one is used in covalently bonding to each of the two neighboring carbons. This leaves six electrons, shared equally around the ring in delocalized pi molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself.[6] This represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds all of bond order 1.5. This equivalency can also explained by resonance forms.[6] The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring, with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.[6]
The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by Sir Robert Robinson and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison & Boyd textbook on organic chemistry.[8] The proper use of the symbol is debated: some publications use it to any cyclic π system, while others use it only for those π systems that obey Hückel's rule. Some argue that, in order to stay in line with  Robinson's originally intended proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 π-electron systems.[9] In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a three-center two-electron bond.[9]

Benzene and derivatives of benzene[edit]
Substitution nomenclature of benzene[6]
Benzene derivatives have from one to six substituents attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are phenol, which carries a hydroxyl group, and toluene with a methyl group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring, their spatial relationship becomes important for which the arene substitution patterns ortho, meta, and para are devised.[10] When reacting to form more complex benzene derivatives, the substituents on a benzene ring can be described as either activated or deactivated, which are electron donating and electron withdrawing respectively.[10] Activators are known as ortho-para directors, and deactivators are known as meta directors.[10] Upon reacting, substituents will be added at the ortho, para or meta positions, depending on the directivity of the current substituents to make more complex benzene derivatives, often with several isomers. Electron flow leading to re-aromatization is key in ensuring the stability of such products.[10]
For example, three isomers exist for cresol because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group (both ortho para directors) can be placed next to each other (ortho), one position removed from each other (meta), or two positions removed from each other (para).[11] Given that both the methyl and hydroxyl group are ortho-para directors, the ortho and para isomers are typically favoured.[11] Xylenol has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.[citation needed]

Arene rings can stabilize charges, as seen in, for example, phenol (C6H5–OH), which is acidic at the hydroxyl (OH), as charge on the oxygen (alkoxide –O−) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

Non-benzylic arenes[edit]
Although benzylic arenes are common, non-benzylic compounds are also exceedingly important. Any compound containing a cyclic portion that conforms to Hückel's rule and is not a benzene derivative can be considered a non-benzylic aromatic compound.[6]

Monocyclic arenes[edit]
Of annulenes larger than benzene, [12]annulene and [14]annulene are weakly aromatic compounds and [18]annulene, Cyclooctadecanonaene, is aromatic, though strain within the structure causes a slight deviation from the precisely planar structure necessary for aromatic categorization.[12] Another example of a non-benzylic monocyclic arene is the cyclopropenyl (cyclopropenium cation), which satisfies Hückel's rule with an n equal to 0.[13] Note, only the cationic form of this cyclic propenyl is aromatic, given that neutrality in this compound would violate either the octet rule or Hückel's rule.[13]
Other non-benzylic monocyclic arenes include the aforementioned heteroarenes that can replace carbon atoms with other heteroatoms such as N, O or S.[6] Common examples of these are the six-membered pyrrole and five-membered pyridine, both of which have a substituted nitrogen[14]

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons[edit]
Hexabenzocoronene is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
Main article: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also known as polynuclear aromatic compounds (PAHs) are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused aromatic rings and do not contain heteroatoms or carry substituents.[15] Naphthalene is the simplest example of a PAH. PAHs occur in oil, coal, and tar deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass).[16] As pollutants, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic.[17][18][19][20] PAHs are also found in cooked foods.[16] Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.[16][17] They are also a good candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life.[21] In graphene the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.[22]

Reactions[edit]
Aromatic ring systems participate in many organic reactions.

Substitution[edit]
In aromatic substitution, one substituent on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another reagent.[6] The two main types are electrophilic aromatic substitution, when the active reagent is an electrophile, and nucleophilic aromatic substitution, when the reagent is a nucleophile. In radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the active reagent is a radical.[23][24]
An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of salicylic acid, where a nitro group is added para to the hydroxide substituent:


Aromatic nucleophilic substitution
Nucleophilic aromatic substitution involves displacement of a leaving group, such as a halide, on an aromatic ring. Aromatic rings usually nucleophilic, but in the presence of electron-withdrawing groups aromatic compounds undergo nucleophilic substitution. Mechanistically, this reaction differs from a common SN2 reaction, because it occurs at a trigonal carbon atom (sp2 hybridization).[25]

Hydrogenation[edit]
Hydrogenation of arenes create saturated rings. The compound 1-naphthol is completely reduced to a mixture of decalin-ol isomers.[26]


The compound resorcinol, hydrogenated with Raney nickel in presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide forms an enolate which is alkylated with methyl iodide to 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione:[27]


Dearomatization[edit]
In dearomatization reactions the aromaticity of the reactant is lost. In this regard, the dearomatization is related to hydrogenation.  A classic approach is Birch reduction. The methodology is used in synthesis.[28]

James G. Wilson (1915–1987) was an embryologist and anatomist, known for his Six Principles of Teratology. In 1960 he co-founded The Teratology Society, and was since then one of its most active members.


Six principles[edit]
Along with this new awareness of the in utero vulnerability of the developing mammalian embryo came the development and refinement of The Six Principles of Teratology which are still applied today. These principles of teratology were put forth by Jim Wilson in 1959 and in his monograph Environment and Birth Defects.[8] These principles guide the study and understanding of teratogenic agents and their effects on developing organisms:
Susceptibility to teratogenesis depends on the genotype of the conceptus and the manner in which this interacts with adverse environmental factors.
Susceptibility to teratogenesis varies with the developmental stage at the time of exposure to an adverse influence. There are critical periods of susceptibility to agents and organ systems affected by these agents.
Teratogenic agents act in specific ways on developing cells and tissues to initiate sequences of abnormal developmental events.
The access of adverse influences to developing tissues depends on the nature of the influence. Several factors affect the ability of a teratogen to contact a developing conceptus, such as the nature of the agent itself, route and degree of maternal exposure, rate of placental transfer and systemic absorption, and composition of the maternal and embryonic/fetal genotypes.
There are four manifestations of deviant development (Death, Malformation, Growth Retardation and Functional Defect).
Manifestations of deviant development increase in frequency and degree as dosage increases from the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) to a dose producing 100% Lethality (LD100).

The James G. Wilson Publication Award is annually presented in recognition of the best paper accepted or published in the journal Birth Defects Research (formerly known as Teratology).

Tikitherium is an extinct genus of mammaliaforms from India, known from a single upper tooth. Originally argued to be a primitive mammaliaform from the Late Triassic, a 2024 study argued that it actually represented the remains of a shrew from the Neogene.[1] Tikitherium refers to Tiki, the village located near the Tiki Formation where the specimen was originally thought to have come from, and therium is Greek for “Beast”. The species was named copei in honor of Edward Drinker Cope for his pioneering discoveries towards understanding mammalian molars.[2]


History and discovery[edit]
Tikitherium copei was first described by Datta in 2005. The first and only specimen is an upper tooth that was thought to have discovered in the lower part of the Late Triassic Tiki Formation, located in the South Rewa Gondwana Basin, India. Both the genus Tikitherium and the species copei were named by Datta in 2005. The currently only known specimen was deposited in the Paleontology Division of the Geological Survey of India, Calcutta.[2] Although only a single tooth was found, it showed several derived features that are similar to other early mammalian dentitions, but further detailed comparisons showed the various differences that allowed this tooth to specifically stand out on its own.[2]

Classification[edit]
Tikitherium is considered to be mammal based on Datta (2005).[2] However, the phylogeny based on Luo and Martin (2007) places Tikitherium and Docodonta as sister taxa, which are Mammaliformes, based on the shared traits of wear facets and platform on the lingual side of the molars. Although Luo and Martin conclude that Tikitherium and Docodonta are the most closely related, it is debated that Woutersia instead may be the sister taxa to Docodonta due to the similarity of their prominent lingual cusps.[3]

A 2024 study argued that the tooth was actually the upper fourth premolar of a shrew belonging to the subfamily Crocidurinae, and actually dated to the Neogene rather than the Late Triassic as had previously been supposed. The authors suggested that T. copei "likely represents a distinct taxon at least at the species level. However, as the validity of T. copei is not certain, Pal/CHQ-009, the holotype of T. copei, should be currently identified as Crocidurinae gen. et sp. indet."[1]

Description[edit]
Tikitherium is only known from a single upper tooth, originally argued to be a left molar but currently thought to be a right fourth premolar. The tooth closely resembles members of the modern shrew subfamily Crocidurinae in having a "short horseshoe-shaped protocone", and the hypocone being absent. The tooth is broadly similar to those of species of Suncus. It differs from modern members of Crocidurinae by "a more massive central cusp (paracone) and a more obtuse angle between the paracone axis and the lingual lobe.", which are likely plesiomorphic features.[1]

Geological and paleoenvironment[edit]
Tikitherium was previously thought to have originated from the Tiki Formation, which is well known for its Late Triassic vertebrates. However, it has since been argued that Tikitherium actually was found in reworked sediments derived from erosion of the Tiki Formation that formed much later during the Neogene. A similar issue was previously reported with Tikiguania which was also previously interpreted as coming from the Tiki Formation, and thus the oldest known squamate, but was later interpreted as modern agamid lizard coming from Neogene or Quaternary deposits.[1]

The Fourche LaFave River Bridge carries Arkansas Highway 7 across the Fourche LaFave River in western Perry County, Arkansas, downstream of the Nimrod Dam. It is a three-span open spandrel concrete arch bridge, with its longest span measuring 184 feet (56 m), and its total length 518 feet (158 m). The arches are mounted on concrete abutments and piers. The bridge deck is asphalt, and is lined by ornate concrete balustrades. It was built in 1941 by the Luten Bridge Company, and is a well-preserved example of style from that period.[2]
The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.[1]

Baptismal vows are taken by the candidate, godparents, or parents when an individual receives the sacrament of baptism.
Baptismal vows are the renunciations required of an adult candidate for baptism just before the sacrament is conferred.[1]  In the case of an infant baptism they are given by the godparents (sponsors) or parents themselves. In many Christian denominations, the taking of baptismal vows incorporates a person into church membership.[2]


Questions for candidates[edit]
According to the Roman Ritual of the Catholic Church, three questions are addressed to the person to be baptized: "Dost thou renounce Satan? and all his works? and all his pomps?" To each of these interrogation the person, or the sponsor in his name, replies: "I do renounce".[3] The Sunday Service of the Methodists, the first liturgical book of Methodism, contains the following baptismal vows:[4]

Question. Dost thou renounce Satan and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all covetous desires of the same, and the carnal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow, or be led by them? Answer. I renounce them all.Question. Dost thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth. And in Jesus Christ his only begotten Son our Lord? And that he was conceived by the Holy Ghost; born of the Virgin Mary; that he suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; that he went down into hell, and also did rise again the third day; that he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; and from thence he shall come again, at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead? And doth thou believe in the Holy Ghost; the Holy Catholic Church; the Communion of Saints; the Remission of Sins; the Resurrection of the Body; and everlasting Life after Death? Answer. All this I steadfastly believe. Question. Wilt thou be baptized in this faith? Answer. This is my desire. Question. Wilt thou then obediently keep God's holy will and commandments, and walk in the same all the days of thy life?Answer. I will endeavour so to do, God being my helper.[4]
Renewal of baptismal vows[edit]
In Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism, the practice of renewing the baptismal promises is more or less widespread and often happens at one's First Holy Communion and Confirmation, as well as annually during the Easter Vigil.[3] Additionally, Martin Luther, the father of the Lutheran Churches, taught that "we are to daily renew our baptism" and as such, when believers rise in the morning, they should proclaim “I am baptized into Christ.”[5] On New Year's Eve, congregations belonging to various Methodist connexions, such as the United Methodist Church, Free Methodist Church and Pilgrim Holiness Church, conduct a watchnight service in the form of the Covenant Renewal Service, so that Methodist believers can personally renew their covenant with God every year; this liturgy is traditionally preceded by prayer and fasting.[6][7]

Royal Air Force Cosford or RAF Cosford (formerly DCAE Cosford)[1] (ICAO: EGWC) is a Royal Air Force station in Cosford, Shropshire, England just to the northwest of Wolverhampton and next to Albrighton.


History[edit]
Origins[edit]
RAF Cosford opened in 1938 as a joint aircraft maintenance, storage and technical training unit.[2] It was originally intended to be opened as RAF Donington (the parish in which it is located) but to avoid confusion with the nearby army camp at Donnington it was named after Cosford Grange House which was located at the south western edge of the airfield.[3] It has remained mainly a training unit to this day. The Fulton barrack block was built just before the Second World War as the largest single building barrack block in the UK. The block was named after Captain Fulton (an early Air Force pioneer) and paid for by his widow, Lady Fulton.[4] It is a listed building and is now used for technical training.[5]
No 2 School of Technical Training was formed in 1938 and during the Second World War it trained 70,000 airmen in engine, airframe and armament trades. No 2 School of Technical Training was subsumed into the No 1 School of Technical Training when it moved to Cosford from RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire.[6]
In the Second World War No. 12 Ferry Pool of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was formed at Cosford. This unit delivered Spitfires from the station, returning with bombers or fighters for No 9 Maintenance Unit. Ferry flights were often flown by women pilots. Amy Johnson came to Cosford on more than one occasion.[7]
In 1940 after the Fall of France a depôt was established at RAF Cosford for Free Czechoslovak personnel joining the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.[8]
The airfield runway was originally a grass strip.[9] During the bad winter of 1940–4 landing heavy aircraft, such as Vickers Wellingtons and Avro Ansons, turned the strip into a mudbath. This prompted the construction of a paved runway of 1,146 yards (1,048 m) long and 46 yards (42 m) wide.[10]
A substantial hospital staffed by Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service personnel was established at RAF Cosford and was the most westerly such RAF hospital in the UK. It consisted of wooden spurred huts. It was the main centre for repatriated prisoners of war, processing more than 13,000 by 1948. Many from the Far East had to remain for long-term treatment.[11] The hospital was open to the general public as well as servicemen and women. It was closed on 31 December 1977 and demolished in 1980.[12]
The extensive sports facilities at Cosford, located around a banked indoor running track, became well known nationally through televised annual indoor championships that featured top athletes from all over the world.[13]

Defence Training Review[edit]
A Grob G 115E Tutor operated by No. 8 Air Experience Flight RAF posted to RAF Cosford.Following the UK Government's 2001 Defence Training Review (DTR), the Ministry of Defence proposed handing over armed forces skills training to a private sector bidder for a 25-year term, and it was announced on 17 January 2007 that the Metrix consortium had been awarded Preferred Bidder status for Package 1 of this programme. As a consequence, it was anticipated that all technical training would move from Cosford to Metrix's main campus to be built on the RAF St Athan site over a 5-year period from 2008.[14] This in turn was deferred with no anticipated move from Cosford to St Athan for DCAE and No1 RS staff and trainees before 2014–15 at the earliest. For those other training schools, headquarters and units then at Cosford, decisions were yet to be made about their future location.[15]
On 31 January 2008, the Government announced that when 1 Signal Brigade and 102 Logistics Brigade withdrew from Germany they would move to Cosford.  It was also noted that Metrix proposed to establish a Learning Centre and Design facility at the Cosford site.[16]
In December 2012 the Government announced that training facilities from RAF Cosford would be moved by the end of 2015 to the site of the former RAF Station at Lyneham as part of the projected tri-service Defence College of Technical Training, in common with Army and Royal Navy training facilities that would also be consolidated on the site. However, on 15 September 2015, the Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon announced in Parliament by written statement that: the Lyneham site would be used only by the army; that Cosford would not be closed and would remain as a separate RAF training establishment; that it would be given extra work, with a fourth training school (No 4 School of Technical Training) moving to Cosford from MoD St Athan in south Wales. The announcement was described in local media as "a Government U-turn".[17]
No. 633 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, which operated the Grob Vigilant T1, was disbanded in November 2016.[18]
No. 2 School of Technical Training reformed on 20 July 2023 and took responsibility for the activities of the Aerosystems Engineer and Management Training School.[19]

Training[edit]
Cosford became part of the Defence College of Aeronautical Engineering (DCAE), which was formed on 1 April 2004. The Defence College at RAF Cosford came under the Defence Technical Training Change Programme (DCTTP) and as such, with effect from 1 October 2012, was renamed the Defence School of Aeronautical Engineering (DSAE).[1]

Air Ambulance[edit]
RAF Cosford's airfield site is home to one of the Midlands Air Ambulance helicopters. The first aircraft arrived on site in October 1991 with two other platforms based elsewhere in the region. Cosford remains the operations hub for the service.[22]

RAF Museum Cosford[edit]
Main article: Royal Air Force Museum Cosford
The site is also home to the Aerospace Museum, which is a branch of the Royal Air Force Museum.  Amongst the large collection of military aircraft is a unique collection of research and development aircraft, including one of two existing examples of the TSR2, a multi-role combat aircraft, controversially scrapped by the Wilson Government and still a point of discussion within the RAF.[23]
The Cold War Exhibition was opened on 7 February 2007 by former prime minister Baroness Thatcher and HRH Princess Anne.[24] Exhibits include the only collection of three V bombers (Valiant, Victor and Vulcan) in the same place in the world.[25]

RAF Cosford Air Show[edit]

The Cosford Air Show is now the only Royal Air Force air show that is officially supported by the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom,[27] following the closure of RAF Leuchars and the runway resurfacing at RAF Waddington.[note 1] The latter events led to the ending of air shows at those stations.[28][26] The event at RAF Cosford regularly hosts flying and static displays which attract more than 50,000 people.[29]
An air show at Cosford was first proposed in 1978[30] and has continued to the present day. The event was cancelled in 2003 owing to an inability to secure enough operational military aircraft. The war in Iraq had meant that RAF aircraft were fully committed and none could not be spared for the air show.[31] The runway at Cosford is only 1,200 yards (1,100 m) in length.[32]  Consequently, most flying displays necessitate aircraft being flown in either direct from their home stations or after 
a temporary overnight deployment to RAF Shawbury which has a runway 300 yd (270 m) longer.[33][34][26]
The airshow varies in detail from year to year but comprises the usual mix of flying and static displays, fun fair rides, concession stands, food outlets and trade stands.[35] It also serves to raise money for charity whilst also being seen by the Royal Air Force as a recruitment event, as part of its wider public engagement. Recent years have seen the promotion of STEM events[36] with guests such as Carol Vorderman highlighting the STEM approach.[37] All profits raised at the event go to supporting charities officially recognized  by the air show committee.[38] The event in 2016 raised £115,000 for RAF charities.[36]
In 2013, Prince Harry, as a member of No. 662 Squadron of the Army Air Corps, took part in the Apache helicopter demonstration at the air show,[39] and, in 2018, Cosford hosted an RAF airshow marking the centenary of the Royal Air Force.[40]
As there is restricted access by motor vehicle, all roads into the Cosford site are one-way during events, with traffic flow inwards in the morning and outwards in the afternoon and evening.  Occasionally, there are tailbacks and queuing on the M54 and the slip and access roads have to be closed on the site reaching its 18,000 vehicle parking limit.[41] The local train operator, Arriva Trains Wales, offers a combined rail and air show ticket at a discount, allowing users direct access to the airshow on foot.[42] Cosford railway station is next to the main crash gate access point at the eastern edge of the airfield.[43]
There are hopes that the airshow might be extended to take place over two days, to rival to the Royal International Air Tattoo which attracts 150,000 spectators.[36]

Heritage[edit]
Station badge and motto[edit]
The RAF Cosford Badge is adorned with an oak tree and the motto is Seul Le Premier Pas Coute, which translates as Only the Beginning is Difficult.[44] The oak tree is symbolic of the nearby oak at Boscobel which King Charles II took refuge in after the Battle of Worcester.[45] The idea behind this association is that from little acorns, great oak trees grow (from trainees the airmen of the future grow).[46] This badge was shared with the No. 2 School of Technical Training until 1986, when the School adopted a new badge depicting the iron bridge of Ironbridge and the motto, Scientia Pons Perpetuus Est which translates as Knowledge is a Lasting Bridge.[47]

Built heritage[edit]
Fulton Block Cosford
The station's Fulton Block, a combined barracks block, institute and mess, was grade II listed in December 2005. Built between 1938 and 1939 as permanent accommodation for 1,000 personnel, it was designed in the Moderne architectural style by J H Binge, of the Air Ministry's Directorate of Works and Buildings.[48]

Accidents and incidents[edit]
On 4 March 2000, Julian Paszki of Wrekin Gliding Club was killed when his Ex-RAF Chipmunk aircraft crashed. The aircraft was seen to veer left and dive into the ground despite being only 30 feet (9.1 m) in the air at the time. Mr Paszki was pulled alive from the wreckage but died at Selly Oak Hospital later that same day.[50][51]

In popular culture[edit]
RAF Cosford is the location for James May's Toy Stories, where the BBC's Top Gear presenter constructed a 1:1 scale Supermarine Spitfire in the style of an Airfix kit with the help of students from the Thomas Telford school and Air Cadets from the ATC.[52]

High Civilization(1991)

Size Isn't Everything(1993)

Still Waters(1997)

Size Isn't Everything is the twentieth studio album by the Bee Gees, released in the UK on 13 September 1993,[2] and the US on 2 November of the same year.[1] The brothers abandoned the contemporary dance feel of the previous album High Civilization and went for what they would describe as "A return to our sound before Saturday Night Fever".[1]


Recording[edit]
The album marked the Bee Gees's return to Polydor Records after their three-album contract with Warner Bros. Records.[3] The album was recorded following a time of considerable strain for the Gibb brothers. Maurice had only recently managed to overcome his long-term struggle with alcoholism and Barry Gibb's wife and prematurely newborn daughter both suffered ill health. Barry himself was also scheduled to have back surgery. Subsequently, on 6 March 1992, the brothers' father, Hugh Gibb, died, the day after the birthday of their late brother Andy, who had died in 1988. The album was dedicated to Hugh. Work on the album began in 1992.[4]

Content[edit]
The first track "Paying the Price of Love" has numerous "alternate mixes" available in different releases. "Kiss of Life" is an energetic rock/dance hybrid with an impressively complex vocal line involving distinctive Robin and Barry's solo vocals as well as the group's vocals. "Omega Man" and "Above and Beyond" feature lead vocals by Maurice Gibb. On "Haunted House", Barry commented in an interview with Q magazine, "I guess you could say the song's about divorce". According to Robin, "Heart Like Mine" was inspired by Enya's moody songs, and he gets some of the slow dreamy feel of her music. "Blue Island" was dedicated to the children of the former Yugoslavia and according to Barry that the song was the nicest track they had ever written.[3]
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" became the biggest hit on Size Isn't Everything. The last track, "Decadance" was a new remix of the classic No. 1 hit "You Should Be Dancing", which was included only on the European version of the album. The unison scream of the line ("My baby moves at midnight") by Barry at 2:20 was first sung to the public back in 1989, towards the end of the One for All Tour in Melbourne.[3]

Critical reception[edit]

On 9 August 1993, the album's first single, "Paying the Price of Love", was released in the UK and peaked at No. 23. The album peaked at No. 33 in the UK in late September. It then disappeared from the charts, only to return in December 1993 when the album's second single, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", became a UK top five hit.[9] The album again peaked at No. 23. In all, the album spent sixteen weeks inside the UK Top 100 and was certified gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. A third single, the ballad "How to Fall in Love, Part 1", was released on 4 April 1994 in the UK, peaking at No. 30.[1] This made Size Isn't Everything the first Bee Gees album to contain three UK top 30 hits since 1979's Spirits Having Flown and many consider this album their strongest post-disco album.[10]
Reaction to the album in the US was less successful,[11] where the album peaked at No. 153 and spent only three weeks inside the whole Billboard 200.[12] The single "Paying the Price of Love" only reached No. 74 in the US during the fall of 1993,[13] presumably because by 1993, The Bee Gees were an adult contemporary group and this single was too heavy for AC stations with its hip-hop influenced percussion.[14] The European hit single, "For Whom the Bell Tolls", bubbled under on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 109.[15]
Reception of the album was mixed around the world, though it is notable that it was one of the most successful Bee Gees albums in Argentina, peaking at No. 1 due to the big success of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" there.[16] Worldwide sales of the album are estimated to be over 700,000 copies.[17] According to Barry, when asked on American breakfast shows why the album was called Size Isn't Everything, he explained that the Bee Gees have never been hyped and that they have always had to prove themselves musically, so the title came from that idea.[16][18]
