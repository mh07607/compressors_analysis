American psychologist (1910–1979)
Joseph Gaither PrattBorn(1910-08-31)August 31, 1910DiedNovember 3, 1979(1979-11-03) (aged 69)Occupation(s)Psychologist, parapsychologist
Joseph Gaither Pratt (August 31, 1910 – November 3, 1979) was an American psychologist who specialized in the field of parapsychology. Among his research interests were extrasensory perception, psychokinesis, mediumship and poltergeists.
Much of Pratt's research was conducted while he was associated with J. B. Rhine's Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University (1932–1964), and he also conducted research while associated with Columbia University (1935–1937), under Gardner Murphy, and the University of Virginia (1964–1975). Pratt was co-experimenter in the Pearce–Pratt and Pratt–Woodruff tests that are considered by some parapsychologists to have provided evidence for psi, though critics discovered flaws in the experiments.[1][2] He was the principal author of the publication Extrasensory Perception After Sixty Years (1940).[3] He was the principal author of an article in the journal Nature that offered a statistical summary of almost a decade of experiments with the selected participant, Pavel Štěpánek.


Biography[edit]
J. G. Pratt was born on August 31, 1910,[4] at Winston-Salem in the Piedmont section of North Carolina, the fourth among 10 children of a large farming family. From an early age, he planned to become a Methodist minister. He commenced his university studies in 1928 at Trinity College, Durham, in what was to become Duke University's School of Religion, and from which he obtained his B.A. in 1931. Pratt came to realize that "my mind was not suited to a profession in which the answers to the great questions regarding man and his relation to the universe are largely taken on faith". Accordingly, in 1932, he entered Duke's Department of Psychology, from which he graduated with a M.A. in 1933, and a Ph.D. in 1936. His doctoral thesis was concerned with the psychology of learning, as informed by his experiments on white rats.[5]
Pratt spent two of his early academic years (1935–1937) at Columbia University, upon the invitation of Gardner Murphy to there seek to replicate the results of forced-choice ESP experiments, as offered by J. B. Rhine at Duke University. From 1937, Pratt worked as Research Associate, and then as Assistant Director, of the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University, under Rhine. A brief hiatus to his research occurred from 1942 to 1946, while he served in the U.S. Navy. Pratt continued as Assistant Director of the Parapsychology Laboratory until, in 1964, Rhine reorganized the Laboratory outside of Duke University, and within his own Foundation for Research on the Nature of Man. From this point onwards, Pratt maintained a professional relationship with the University of Virginia.[6]
Pratt was President of the Parapsychological Association in 1960. In 1970, together with Jürgen Keil, of the University of Tasmania, he was awarded the Parapsychology Laboratory's McDougall award for their research with the selected participant Pavel Štěpánek. His later years were somewhat concerned by attentions to the claims of fraud against his one-time research associate, S. G. Soal.
Pratt died on November 3, 1979. His archives are stored at Duke University, and within the historical collections section of the medical library at the University of Virginia.  Pratt's granddaughter is American magazine editor, Jane Pratt.

Experiments[edit]
The Pearce–Pratt experiment[edit]
Pratt and the divinity student Hubert Pearce performed a long distance ESP experiment at the Duke University in 37 sittings between August 1933 and March 1934. For the experiment Pratt positioned himself in a room in the physics building whilst Pearce went to the library. Pratt took a pack of ESP cards and after shuffling them placed it facedown on the table. When the experiment started he took the top card and placed it face down on a book. After a minute the card would be transferred to the table and a second card from the pack would be placed on the book. After a run of twenty-five cards and a short break the same procedure was followed by a second pack.[7]
In the library Pearce would guess to identify each card on the book. Both Pearce and Pratt made a copy of their records which were sent to Joseph Rhine's office. In 37 sittings they both produced 558 hits out of 1,850 trials. Rhine was present at only three of the sittings in Pratt's room as an observer.[8]
In 1960, C. E. M. Hansel investigated the Duke Campus and found that it would have been easy for Pearce to have left the library during the experiment to approach Pratt's room and watch him turn over the cards. According to John Sladek "The room had a clear window giving on to the corridor, a trap door with a hole in it situated right above Pratt's table and Hansel found that he could stand up on the chair in the corridor and peer through a crack at the top of the door to see the cards."[8]
Rhine and Pratt responded to the criticisms claiming that during three of the sittings Rhine was present in the room and could see the subject from the window enter the library. Hansel responded by questioning how Rhine could have been watching everything at once. If he had been looking out the window for Pearce then Pratt could have faked his records and if he was watching Pratt then Pearce may have sneaked out of the library and into Pratt's room.[8]
Paul Kurtz wrote that "Pratt could easily have peeked at the Zener cards by sneaking out of the library to the sender's office, or by using an accomplice."[9] Hansel came to the conclusion that the possibility of trickery had not been ruled out in the experiment, the subject was left unobserved in the library, the room used by Pratt was not screened to make it impossible for outsiders to see inside and the reports themselves contained conflicting statements so because of these factors the experiment could not be regarded as supplying evidence of ESP.[10]
In 1967, the parapsychologist Ian Stevenson criticized one of Hansel's suggestions. Stevenson claimed the position of the rooms in Hansel's plan were inaccurate. Hansel responded to this by claiming the building plan was not to scale and would not alter his argument, as the simplest way for Pearce to have cheated on the experiment would have been to observe the cards from the corridor, and this possibility was not ruled out. Hansel also noted the physics building at the time of the experiment was little used.[11]
Physicist Victor J. Stenger has written:

Hansel tried to get the architect's plans from Duke, but had been rebuffed. If Hansel's scale was so far incorrect as to negate his argument, why not produce plans to demonstrate it? Rhine's lab never demonstrated that Pearce could not have cheated in the ways proposed by Hansel. Hansel did not have to prove anything. The burden of proving that cheating was impossible rested with Rhine and Pratt, not Hansel. Hansel succeeded brilliantly in exposing the shoddiness of the experimental procedures of Rhine's laboratory. Any number of simple precautions could have been taken to guard against fraud. In any sensible experimental protocol, Pearce would have been watched. Pratt's room should have been carefully sealed. Many other precautions with the handling of the data were not taken, giving Pearce or Pratt a number of opportunities to change the figures.[2]
Martin Gardner claimed to have inside information that files in Rhine's laboratory contain material suggesting fraud on the part of Pearce.[12] Gardner also commented "Hansel has shown in his book that Pratt’s experiments with Pearce were almost as amateurishly designed as Rhine’s early test of Lady Wonder, the mind-reading horse, but Pratt lacks the courage to admit it."[13]

The Pratt–Woodruff experiment[edit]
The experiment took place at the Parapsychology Laboratory at Duke University between October 1, 1938, and February 28, 1939. The experiment consisted of Joseph Woodruff the experimenter, Pratt as the observer and a subject.[1] The experiment involved the subject (S) and the experimenter (E) sitting at the sides of a table which was divided by a screen. On the side of the subject five 'key-cards' were placed on pegs. Each of the cards depicted an ESP symbol which the experimenter did not know. Below the ESP cards five blank cards were placed on the table marking their positions. A slot was placed at the bottom of the screen so both the subject and the experimenter could see the blanks. A smaller screen was also used to prevent the subject from seeing what the experimenter was doing.[8]
The experimenter cut an ESP pack of cards, keeping them face down. The subject would then guess the top card by pointing at a blank. If the guess was a cross then the subject would point at the blank below the key card resembling a cross. The experimenter would then take the ESP card and place it opposite the blank indicated.[8] When the pack had been completed the experimenter had five cards before him. The experimenter would then turn over each pile and record how many cards of each symbol it contained. An observer (O) was placed behind the subject. The observer then recorded the positions of the key cards on their pegs. The experimenter could not see this record. The experimenter and the observer would then store their records and lock them away. The three persons present would then would check the positions of the key cards and the number of hits on each pile. In total 32 subjects tested the experiment with the total score for 60, 000 trials being 12, 489 hits.[1]
Critics pointed out that there were serious weaknesses in the experiment so that if the experimenter could learn the position of even one of the key cards he could increase the number of hits. In 1960, C. E. M. Hansel visited the Parapsychology Laboratory and investigated the apparatus and discovered the experiment did not rule out the possibility of trickery. John Sladek wrote regarding Hansel's discovery:

He found that, though the key cards are hung on their pegs in a different order for each run (each twenty-five trials), it is certainly possible for E to guess the new positions of one or two of them. When the screen is laid on its side after a run, E notes that the key card in Position 1 (the right- or left-hand end) is, say, a cross. The screen is then set up for the next run. S or O then removes the key cards from their pegs and replaces them in a different order. But E can see from his movements in what order he removes them (left to right or right to left). Then, unless the key cards are shuffled before replacing them, E can guess that the first or last card replaced will be a cross. E then completes the run as usual, and begins his tally. At this point, neither S or O can see what he's doing. It's easy enough for him to slip a card or two (bearing a cross) into the 'cross' pile without being detected.[8]
Hansel in his book ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation (pp. 125–140) discussed the experiment and its flaws in detail. Hansel wrote the counter-criticisms from Pratt and Woodruff did not hold up to scrutiny as the results from the experiment could have originated through the use of a trick then it cannot be claimed to provide evidence for ESP. Hansel suggested for the experiment to be repeated with additional precautions to prevent the possibility of a trick being used but the experiment was never repeated at the laboratory.[1]

Jonah Lwanga also referred to as Metropolitan Jonah Lwanga (18 July 1945 – 5 September 2021) was an Ugandan prelate, who served as Archbishop of Kampala and Exarch of All Uganda in the Uganda Orthodox Church. Since 1997, he was also the Metropolitan of the Metropolis of  Kampala and All Uganda, in Central Africa under the Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria,  until his death in September 2021. His see was Kampala, with jurisdiction over all Uganda.[1]


Background and education[edit]
Lwanga was born on 18 July 1945 in the village of Ddegeya in present-day Luweero District ,Uganda to Kezia Babitaka.[2] Lwanga's grandfather, Obadiah Basajjakitalo, was one of the two initial leaders of the Orthodox Church in Uganda along with Ruben Spartas Mukasa.[3]
He completed his general education in Bulemezi and Kyaddondo, Uganda (1952-1964).
From 1964 to 1968 he studied at the Ecclesiastical School of Crete. From 1968 to 1978 he held a degree in Theology and Philosophy from the University of Athens.[3]

Vocation[edit]
From 1979 to 1981 he served as Secretary of the Orthodox Mission in Uganda.
Lwanga was ordained a deacon on 1 May 1981 and a year later, in 1982, he was ordained a priest.[4]
After his ordination, Lwanga was appointed Dean at the Archbishop Makarios III Patriarchal Orthodox Seminary in Riruta, Nairobi, and taught theology.[4] He was subsequently elevated to the status of Archimandrite in 1992.[5] Shortly after, he was ordained the Vicar Bishop of Bukoba, Tanzania on 27 January 1992.[5]
On 12 May 1997, Lwanga was transferred from the Bishopric of Bukoba, Tanzania, to Uganda as Metropolitan of Kampala and All Uganda after the death of Metropolitan Theodoros Nankyama [6]..
Lwanga was pronounced dead on 5 September 2021 in Athens, Greece. The cause of death was given as prostate cancer in some sources while others mentioned a "long illness".[7][8]

Inter Religious Council of Uganda[edit]
Alongside Archbishop Livingstone Mpalanyi Nkoyoyo, Sheikh Shaban Mubajje and Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala.Lwanga was a co-founder of the Inter Religious Council of Uganda in 2002.[9] At the time of his death, was a Member, Council of presidents, a position he had held since the time of the body's inception.[10]

Cocks was born in 1938; the son of Ralph Morrison Cocks and Lucille Mary Blackler. He was educated at Felsted School and Hertford College, Oxford.[3] He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1958, and saw military service in Malaya from 1958-1959. After leaving the army, Cocks went up to Hertford College, Oxford in 1959 to read for a bachelor's degree in geology. He subsequently became a research student at Oxford in 1962, funded by the DSIR, and completed his doctoral thesis on Silurian brachiopods from Shropshire in 1965.[4]

Career[edit]
Cocks joined the staff of the Natural History Museum, London as Scientific Officer in the department of palaeontology in September 1965.[5] He was promoted to Senior Scientific Officer the next year, and to Principal Scientific Officer in June 1972. Cocks was appointed to Deputy Keeper in 1982, and was Keeper of Palaeontology from 1986 until retirement in June 1998. From 1970 to 1983 he served as a geologist with the Royal Engineers. He served as president of the Geological Society (1998-2000), Palaeontological Association (1994-1998), Palaeontographical Society (1994-1998) and Geologists' Association (2004-2006). He also served on national and international scientific committees, including the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (1982-2000). Cocks published many papers and books during his career, including The Evolving Earth (1981),[6][7] and Earth History and Palaoegeography,[8] with Trond Torsvik in 2016. In 2019, Cocks published a monograph on Llandovery brachiopods, synthesising much of his taxonomic work of the previous six decades.[9]

Personal life and death[edit]
In 1963, Cocks married Elaine Margaret Sturdy; they had three children, Mark, Zoe and Julia. Cocks died on 5 February 2023, at the age of 84.[10]

Awards[edit]
Cocks was awarded the Coke Medal of the Geological Society of London in 1995; the Andre Dumont Medal of the Belgian Geological Society (Geologica Belgica) in 2003, and in 2010 he was awarded the Palaeontological Association's Lapworth Medal.[11] He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1999 New Year Honours for services to palaeontology.[12]

Whinfell Beacon is a hill of 472 metres (1,549 ft) in South Lakeland, Cumbria, England, to the east of the Lake District.[1][2][3] It is in the far east of the Lake District National Park since the national park's expansion in 2019. It is east of the A6 road and west of the M6 motorway, south of Borrowdale, Westmorland (not the better known Borrowdale in the central lake district) and east of the upper reaches of the River Mint.  
There is a cairn and remains of a shelter near the summit, but the highest point is a few metres away on the north east side of the wall across the summit.[1]
Whinfell Beacon can form part of a 19 kilometres (12 mi) walk starting from the A685 road 3.5 miles (5.6 km) south of Tebay, climbing Grayrigg Forest (with an optional extension to Grayrigg Pike), and following the ridge south of Borrowdale over Birk Fell, Castle Fell and Mabbin Crag, west as far as the A6 until dropping into the valley for the return.[4]
It is one of three summits, along with Grayrigg Forest and Winterscleugh, added to the list of Fellrangers in the new edition (2019-2021) of Mark Richards' eight volumes of guidebooks and bringing the total to 230.[5] They were included after the boundary of the Lake District National Park was extended in 2019, adding them to the national park.[1]

Ragged Atlas(2010)

The Letter(2012)

Ragged Atlas is a studio album by Fred Frith's United States experimental rock group Cosa Brava. It was recorded in San Francisco in December 2008 and was released by Intakt Records in Switzerland on March 5, 2010.[1] Ragged Atlas was the band's first album, and is largely instrumental with a little singing on five of the thirteen the tracks. Frith composed all the music, with lyric contributions on "Lucky Thirteen" by Rebby Sharp, a singer/guitarist Frith had worked with in Orthotonics.


Reception[edit]
Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAll About Jazz[2]AllMusic[3]Clouds and Clocksmixed[4]
John Kelman, Nic Jones and Mark Corroto wrote favorable reviews of Ragged Atlas at All About Jazz,[2][5][6] whereas Beppe Colli at Clouds and Clocks had mixed feeling about the album.[4]
Kelman described Cosa Brava as "the perfect nexus between [Frith's] more accessible yet still left-leaning music for dance, [...] and the more challenging structures of his 1970s work with Henry Cow".[2] He said that Ragged Atlas "transcends time and genre" and has "[b]road dynamics, a blend of acoustic and electric instrumentation, fine compositional detail, and surprisingly memorable melodies".[2] Kelman said that it "stands as one of 2010's most auspicious debuts".[2]
Corroto called the album a "classic 1970s rock opera", and described the music as a mixture of "folk, Celtic, modern chamber, Latin, funk, Eastern, and prog-rock".[6] He said that Frith "never stray[ed] far from joyous music making".[6] Jones wrote that there is an "impishness about the music, a sense of fun that [...] stems from the joy of discovery".[5] As an example he said that the "arguably banal lyric" in the track "Falling Up (for Amanda)" is elevated to another level by the supple music of Carla Kihlstedt's violin".[5] Jones said that "Tall Story" works because of the musicianship of the group, and that in lesser hands it "might come off as so much fluff".[5]
Colli was critical of the album, saying that the volume is "deafening", and that the music is "often tacky, bombastic, as if looking for an applause".[4] He did like some of the tracks, for example "Lucky Thirteen", which he said has a "meditative mood, fine unison from vocals and violin", and "Tall Story", with its "light, fine theme".[4] Overall, however, Colli described the album as "kitsch".[4]

"R. D. Burman" (Rahul Dev Burman) – Burman was an Indian film score composer who "fearlessly mixed genres, styles, cultures, and instruments" to create a "unique body of work" spanning a 30-year career.
"Falling Up (for Amanda)" (Amanda Miller) – Frith described Miller as an "extraordinary dancer, inspiring choreographer, and uncompromising philosopher"; Miller and Frith once led a workshop at the Edinburgh Festival where Miller taught dancers how to "fall up".
"Out on the Town with Rusty, 1967" – Frith met Rusty ("the epitome of cool") while performing at the York Folk Club in mid-1967; they became friends that summer, played at local Working Men's Clubs, and attended a Jimi Hendrix concert in Woburn, Bedfordshire; a few months later, after Frith had returned to university, Rusty was killed in a motorbike accident.
"Blimey, Einstein" (Albert Einstein) – "[H]ey, it ain't rocket science."
"For Tom Zé" (Tom Zé) – Zé inspired Frith with his technique of mixing popular Brazilian song with "wacky" modern composition.

Charles McNider (the original Doctor Mid-Nite and a bearer of the name Starman) is a fictional superhero in DC Comics.[1] The character appeared for the first time in All-American Comics #25 (April 1941).[2]
Like many Golden Age heroes, the original Doctor Mid-Nite appeared as a member of DC's Justice Society of America.
As a blind character, Doctor Mid-Nite is widely regarded as the first superhero in comics to exhibit a physical impairment, pre-dating the creation of Daredevil of Marvel Comics by more than twenty years.
Dr. Mid-Nite made his live appearance on the second season of DC's Legends of Tomorrow played by Kwesi Ameyaw. Doctor Mid-Nite appeared in the first episode of the first season of the DC Universe series Stargirl portrayed by Henry Thomas in season one and by Alex Collins in seasons two and three. Thomas and Collins also voiced the goggles that the new Dr. Mid-Nite Beth Chapel acquires.


Fictional character biography[edit]
Charles McNider is a surgeon who was called one night to remove a bullet from a witness set to testify against mobsters. A mobster named "Killer" Maroni threw a grenade into the room, killing the witness and blinding McNider, with the injury causing him to believe his career as a surgeon was over.[2] One evening, as he was recovering, an owl crashed through his window. Removing the bandages covering his eyes, McNider discovered that he could still see, but only in perfect darkness. McNider developed a special visor allowing him to see in the light and "blackout bombs" capable of blocking out all light, becoming a costumed crime fighter. He adopted the owl, naming it 'Hooty', and it became his sidekick. Upon becoming Doctor Mid-Nite, his first outing had him bringing "Killer" Maroni to justice.[3]
He later joined the Justice Society of America (JSA) and the All-Star Squadron. In 1942, McNider enlisted in the U.S. Medical Corps as a physician during World War II,[4] rising to the rank of captain.[volume & issue needed] Ten years after his debut, McNider briefly assumed the role of Starman after the JSA disbanded when Ted Knight, the original Starman, had a nervous breakdown as a result of his participation in the development of the atomic bomb.[5]
According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, "his opponents include the minstrel the Baleful Banshee, the hypnosis-wielding Doctor Light, the angling-themed Fisherman, and the gang lord Tarantula".[6]
McNider suffered a devastating event in 1953, when the woman he loved, Myra Mason, was murdered by the Shadower, a foe who had learned Doctor Mid-Nite's secret identity.[2]  McNider's later romantic history is unrevealed, but another "old friend" of McNider, Miss Alice King, made an appearance in All-American Comics #90 (October 1947). McNider apparently had no children, but at one point McNider rescued a pregnant woman from attack in Sogndal, Norway and delivered her baby, Pieter Cross, who later became the third Doctor Mid-Nite. McNider was also one of the JSA members captured and placed in suspended animation by the Immortal villain Vandal Savage, before being freed by the Flash.
Charles McNider eventually met his end as one of the casualties of Zero Hour, when he and fellow JSA member Hourman were aged to death by Extant.[7] He was briefly reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night event,[8] only to be destroyed by Mr. Terrific.[9]

Powers, equipment, and abilities[edit]
McNider possesses the metahuman ability to see perfectly in the dark. Utilizing special infrared lenses, McNider can see in light; later in his life, his lenses become more ineffective as his eyesight continues to deteriorate even further, inhibiting his daylight vision. McNider also employs "blackout bombs" which release pitch-black gas that blinds villains yet allowing McNider to see. For a time, he used a weapon called a "cryotuber" which can either control the nervous system of an opponent or fire bursts of heat or cold. He is also a brilliant doctor and a mathematician. In All-Star Comics #13, he is able to communicate with a Neptunian using mathematical equations. As Starman, McNider uses various star-themed gadgets, including an airship designed by the Red Torpedo. McNider is also a superb athlete and fighter, as well as a gifted physician and author.

Other versions[edit]
In Kingdom Come, Alex Ross portrays Doctor Mid-Nite (known here simply as Midnight) as a disembodied cowl amid thick black smoke reminiscent of his "blackout bombs". The wraith is said to be the vengeful spirit of Dr. Charles McNider.
Another version of the character was shown in Dan Jolley and Tony Harris' JSA: The Liberty File as a World War II-era United States intelligence agent code-named the Owl. This character, though presented as a rich playboy, resembles other versions of Doctor Mid-Nite. Though derided for his dalliances with the ladies, McNider was trusted as a valued field operative.
In the Elseworlds novel Batman: Holy Terror - set in a world where Oliver Cromwell lived long enough to extend his rule to America, which is now run by a corrupt theocracy - Doctor Charles McNider was a friend of Thomas and Martha Wayne before their deaths, losing his eyes and his wife for his defiance of the state. When Bruce comes to visit him, he warns Bruce against fighting the system, but also confirms that the Waynes were killed by the ruling Privy Council for providing medical services to those the council has deemed undesirable, such as Jews or homosexuals.
Collected editions[edit]
The original Dr. Mid-Nite (Charles McNider) is one of seven JSA-related heroes whose solo appearances are collected in an anthology entry in the DC Archive Editions series:

In reality, they scattered themselves across time to protect the Spear of Destiny, with McNider going to the year 3000, where he became a researcher and used futuristic technology to restore his sight. However, he is killed by a brainwashed Rip Hunter, who steals his spear fragment for the Legion of Doom.[11]

In flashbacks, he was with the JSA when the Injustice Society of America (ISA) attacked their headquarters. During the battle, Shade pretended to attack McNider to save him, but accidentally lost him in the Shadowlands, leading to the latter being presumed dead. In the present, Beth Chapel assumes the mantle of Doctor Mid-Nite after she discovers McNider's googles. In the second season, McNider eventually makes contact with Chapel and later encounters Courtney Whitmore and Cindy Burman after Eclipso sent them to the Shadowlands. Once Shade uses his abilities to free the trio, McNider and Chapel work to find Eclipso so their allies can defeat him.

Mr & Mrs T is an American brand  of drink mixers owned by Keurig Dr Pepper. (KDP).


History[edit]
Mr & Mrs T Bloody Mary mix was first sold by Herb and June Taylor in 1960.

Edward Salisbury Field Jr. (February 28, 1878 – September 20, 1936) was an American author, playwright, artist, poet, and journalist.


Biography[edit]
He was born on February 28, 1878, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Edward Salisbury and Sarah Mills Hubbard Field.[1] He was the husband of Isobel Osbourne (the step-daughter of Robert Louis Stevenson) and he was step-father of playwright Austin Strong (Isobel's son from a former marriage).[2]
Field was an employee and friend of William Randolf Hearst where he made drawings for Hearst newspapers, signing his drawings with the nom de plume Childe Harold.[1] As a young news man in his 20s, Field became the secretary, protégé, and possibly lover of Fanny Stevenson (who was 38 years older), after the death of her husband Robert Louis Stevenson.[3] After Fanny's death in 1914, Field married her daughter, Isobel Osbourne, who was 20 years his senior.[3] Field became a successful Southern California real estate developer. In the 1920s, oil was discovered on some of his property which made them wealthy.[3]
In 1926, Field purchased Zaca Lake and surrounding land on Figueroa Mountain near Los Olivos, California.[4] His wife, Isobel, built an artists studio there, and the Field home became a popular meeting place for writers and actors.
Field's best known works were the film scripts for Wedding Bells (based on his play of the same name) and Twin Beds (based on his 1913 screwball comedy novel and its stage adaptation). Twin Beds was filmed four times:[5] as Twin Beds in 1920 starring Carter and Flora Parker DeHaven;[6] Twin Beds in 1929 starring Jack Mulhall;[7] as The Life of the Party in 1934;[8] and as Twin Beds in 1942 with George Brent and Joan Bennett.[9]
Field died September 20, 1936, at Zaca Lake, of an apparent heart attack while taking a nap.[10]  He was 58 years old.[2]

50 Squadron SAAF  was a South African Air Force squadron during World War II.

History[edit]
50 Squadron was formed on 1 December 1939 by amalgamating the SAAF's 17, 18 and 19 Squadrons.[2] During the East African Campaign 50 Squadron operated a 'shuttle service' between the warzone in East Africa and South Africa as part of 1 Bomber Transport Brigade. The brigade was re-designated 5 Wing in February 1941, and continued to fly 'shuttle service' flights between the Mediterranean and South Africa until after the war.[3]
The squadron operated Junkers F.13FE, Ju-86Z/K-1 and Ju 52/3M aircraft which had been requisitioned from the South African Airways at the outbreak of war.  The eleven Ju 52's were assigned to 51 Flight, operating a shuttle service from Nairobi to Egypt, Middle East and South Africa.

Huang Kunming (Chinese: 黄坤明; born November 1956) is a Chinese politician, currently serving as the Communist Party secretary of Guangdong and a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. Until 2022, he served as the head of the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party. He joined the Publicity Department in 2014 as a deputy head. Prior to his appointment he served in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, and is considered a close associate of Xi Jinping, the current general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. He was the one time Communist Party secretary of Hangzhou.

Career[edit]
Huang was born in Shanghang County, Fujian province. In December 1974, Huang began serving in the People's Liberation Army. Two years later, he joined the Chinese Communist Party. In 1977, after serving for three years in the army, he went back to his home county and became a secretary. He entered Fujian Normal University in 1978. After graduation, he was sent by the party to work in the Longyan region of Fujian in a series of administrative roles. He later rose through the hierarchy to become Party Committee Secretary of Yongding County, then in February 1998, following the conversion of the administrative status of Longyan from a Prefecture into a "City", Huang became its mayor.
In August 1999, he was sent to the city of Huzhou in neighbouring Zhejiang province to serve as mayor. In February 2003, he became party secretary of Jiaxing, a prosperous city on China's east coast. By June 2007, Huang was named a member of the provincial Party Standing Committee and the head of the provincial party organization's Publicity Department. At around the same time, he earned a Masters of Public Administration from Tsinghua University. In January 2010, Huang was named party secretary of Hangzhou, one of about a dozen cities with "sub-provincial" status in China.
Huang became an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held in the fall of 2012. In October 2013, he was named deputy head of the Central Publicity Department.[1] In December 2014, he was promoted to executive deputy head, with rank equivalent to that of a minister.[2] The executive deputy head position of the Publicity Department is a powerful one, as it oversees roughly all day-to-day administrative aspects of the department. External observers have called Huang's installation in the position as a means to check the influence of Liu Yunshan, a member of the party's top ruling body the Politburo Standing Committee who is widely believed to be a conservative.[3] Huang was also named chief of the Office of the Central Guidance Commission on Building Spiritual Civilization.
The later years of Huang's career roughly follows in the footsteps of Xi Jinping, who was named General Secretary of the Communist Party in 2012. Huang began working with Xi in Fujian province where Xi served as governor. Later Huang moved to Zhejiang during Xi's term as Party Committee Secretary there. After Xi rose to become party leader, Huang again was transferred from Zhejiang to the party centre.[4] Because of Huang's close links with Xi, he is considered a member of the New Zhijiang Army, an informal grouping of Xi's closest associates who were considered destined for higher office.[5] After the 19th Party Congress, Huang became head of the Publicity Department, and a member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party. Shortly thereafter he also became head of a task force on combating pornography and illegal publications.[6]
Huang was an alternate member of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and a full member of the 19th Central Committee.

Leanyer is a northern suburb of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. 


History[edit]
It is on the traditional Country and waterways of the Larrakia people.[2]
The name Leanyer was in general use for the area at the time of development and first appeared on 1869 survey plans. Leanyer is thought to be derived from an Aboriginal word.[3]
During World War II Leanyer was established as a military area, there was an Army post and a military equipment storage facility, gun turrets were also set up along the coast of Lee Point. It was disbanded soon after the end of World War II and residential development of Leanyer started during the 1970s.
The roads and streets within the suburb are named after coastal features and rivers in the northern part of the Northern Territory.
In 2011 the suburb recorded, 3,160.0 millimetres (124.41 in), the highest 2010/11 wet season rainfall total recorded in the Northern Territory, breaking the previous all-time record of 3,048.6 millimetres (120.02 in) set in Pirlangimpi on the Melville Island during the 1999/2000 wet season.[4][5]

Present day[edit]
There are a number of schools in the suburb such as Leanyer Primary School and Good Shepherd Lutheran College. Attractions in the area include the Casuarina Coastal Reserve and beach, Holmes Jungle Nature Park, Leanyer Swamp, Leanyer Recreation Park - a free water park, the Tracy Village Social Club and the Hibiscus Shoppingtown.

Notable Places[edit]

Walter Joseph "Jay" Clayton III (born July 11, 1966) is an American attorney who served as the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017 until December 23, 2020. He was nominated for the position by President Donald Trump.


Early life and education[edit]
Clayton was born at Fort Eustis in Newport News, Virginia.[1] He grew up near Hershey, Pennsylvania, where his father worked for the local chocolate company, and Wallingford, Pennsylvania. Clayton graduated from Strath Haven High School in 1984. After attending Lafayette College, where he was a member of the soccer team,[2] Clayton transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree in 1988, and received the Thouron Award for post-graduate study in the United Kingdom.[citation needed] He received a Bachelor of Arts (promoted to a Master of Arts, per tradition) in economics from King's College, Cambridge, in 1990.[3] He then attended the University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he graduated cum laude and Order of the Coif in 1993 with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree.[1][4]
During college and graduate school, Clayton was a member of the Ocean City Beach Patrol and Penn Law rugby team, an intern with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia and U.S. Representative Curt Weldon, and an employee of United Engineers and Constructors.[5][6]

Career[edit]
From 1993 to 1995, Clayton clerked for Judge Marvin Katz of the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.[7]
After being a summer associate at the firm in the summer of 1992, Clayton joined Sullivan & Cromwell full-time in October 1995 and became a partner in January 2001.[5] At Sullivan & Cromwell, Clayton was a member of the firm's management committee and co-managing partner of the firm's General Practice Group.[1][8] He specialized in mergers and acquisitions transactions and capital markets offerings[7] and represented prominent Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs.[9] He served as an adviser to numerous companies regarding issues related to the SEC, Federal Reserve, Department of Justice, and other agencies.[10]
He has also helped multiple corporations raise money through initial public offerings, including Alibaba Group,[11] Ally Financial, Och-Ziff Capital Management, Oaktree Capital Management, Blackhawk Network Holdings, and Moelis & Company.[7] During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Clayton advised Bear Stearns in its fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in 2007, Barclays Capital in the purchase of Lehman Brothers' assets following their bankruptcy, and Goldman Sachs in connection with the investment by Berkshire Hathaway.[4]
Clayton disclosed to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that his other corporate clients had included TeliaSonera AB, Ally Financial, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Volkswagen, SoftBank Group, The Weinstein Company, Pershing Square Capital Management, and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Clayton's individual clients included Ocwen's former head William Erbey,[12] Paul Tudor Jones, former Attorney General of Ireland Peter Southerland, CDW founder Michael Krasny and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.[13]
Clayton earned $7.6 million in 2016 from his firm and has a family wealth of at least $50 million. A substantial portion of his holdings were in mutual funds of the Vanguard Group. His investments also included private funds managed by Apollo Global Management, Bain Capital, J.C. Flowers & Co., and Richard C. Perry but he divested these investments upon confirmation.[13]

SEC chair[edit]
Nomination and confirmation[edit]
On January 4, 2017, President-elect Donald Trump announced his intention to nominate Clayton to be SEC Chairman,[14] and he was nominated on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017.[15] Clayton's nomination was endorsed by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.[13] U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat representing Nevada, expressed concern that Clayton represented Swedish firm TeliaSonera in a proposed venture that would combine Russian telecommunications companies MegaFon and Altimo.[13] Clayton was not thought to have any ties to the Russian companies.[13] On April 4, 2017, the Senate Banking Committee voted 15–8 to send Clayton's nomination to the full Senate, with three Democrats voting in favor of Clayton.[16]
On May 2, 2017, the U.S. Senate voted 61–37 to confirm Clayton as Chairman of the SEC. Votes cast in favor of Clayton's confirmation included nine Democrats and one Independent alongside 51 Republican votes.[17] On May 4, 2017, Clayton was sworn in, marking the official beginning of his role as Chairman.[18]

Tenure[edit]
In connection with the nomination of Clayton in January, President Trump said in a statement that "[w]e need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers."[19] Upon Clayton's swearing-in, the SEC consisted of Clayton; Michael Piwowar, who was serving as acting Chairman; and Kara Stein. Subsequently, Hester Peirce and Robert J. Jackson Jr. joined the commission. In 2018, Piwowar and Stein stepped down, and Elad Roisman and Allison Lee joined the Commission in 2018 and 2019 respectively.[20]
Clayton has expressed concern about the decline in the number of U.S. public companies and also has been outspoken on securities law issues related to distributed ledger technology, cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. Some predicted that he will look to encourage initial public offerings (IPOs) of companies and streamline the capital formation process by reducing the regulatory framework that applies to public companies in the United States.[18][21]
Under Clayton's tenure as chairman of the SEC, the SEC charged the fewest number of insider trading cases since the Reagan administration.[22]
In November 2020, Clayton stated his intention to resign at the end of the year, although his term would expire at the end of June 2021,[23] Clayton resigned on December 23, 2020.[24] One of his final actions and on his last day at the SEC before resigning was to sue Ripple Labs challenging the legality of trading cryptocurrency XRP as an unregistered security.[25]

Southern District of New York[edit]
On June 19, 2020, Attorney General Bill Barr announced that President Trump would nominate Clayton to replace Geoffrey Berman as United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.[26][27][28]
Clayton was criticized for his role in the removal of Geoffrey Berman at a U.S. House hearing. Clayton said it was entirely his idea to become the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He said he wanted the position because he had a "strong desire to continue in public service", and return to his New York-based family.[29]

After SEC[edit]
In February 2021, Apollo Global Management appointed Clayton to the newly created role of lead independent director on its board.[30] Clayton also rejoined Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, where he was a partner before entering government, to become senior policy adviser and counsel.[31]

Professional memberships and activities[edit]
Clayton is a member of the American Bar Association, served as an Adjunct Professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School beginning in 2009, and was Chairman of the New York City Bar Committee on International Business Transactions beginning in 2010.[10] Prior to his confirmation, Clayton served on the Executive Committee of the Metropolitan Golf Association.[32]

Personal life[edit]
Clayton's wife Gretchen, whom he started dating while they attended the same Pennsylvania high school, worked at Goldman Sachs. Clayton's wife resigned from her job prior to his confirmation.[13]

Hu Shih[1][2][3][4] (Chinese: 胡適; 17 December 1891 – 24 February 1962), also known as Hu Suh in early references,[5][6] was a Chinese diplomat, essayist and fiction writer, literary scholar, philosopher, and politician. Hu contributed to Chinese liberalism and language reform and advocated for the use of written vernacular Chinese.[7] He participated in the May Fourth Movement and China's New Culture Movement. He was a president of Peking University.[8] He had a wide range of interests such as literature, philosophy, history, textual criticism, and pedagogy. He was also a redology scholar.
Hu was editor of the Free China Journal, which was shut down for criticizing Chiang Kai-shek. In 1919, he also criticized Li Dazhao. Hu advocated that the world adopt Western-style democracy. Moreover, Hu criticized Sun Yat-sen's claim that people are incapable of self-rule. Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in The Outline of National Reconstruction.[9]
Hu wrote many essays attacking communism as a whole, including the political legitimacy of Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party. Specifically, Hu said that the autocratic dictatorship system of the CCP was "un-Chinese" and against history. In the 1950s, Mao and the Chinese Communist Party launched a campaign criticizing Hu Shih's thoughts.[10] Mao and Chinese historians criticized Hu Shih as ''the earliest, the most persistent and most uncompromising enemy of Chinese Marxism and socialist thought.''[11]


Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Hu was born on 17 December 1891, in Shanghai to Hu Chuan (胡傳), and his third wife Feng Shundi (馮順弟).[12] Hu Chuan was a tea merchant who became a public servant, serving in Manchuria, Hainan, and Taiwan. During their marriage, Feng Shun-di was younger than some of Hu Chuan's children.[12] After Hu Shih's birth, Hu Chuan moved to Taiwan to work in 1892, where his wife and Hu Shih joined him in 1893. Shortly before Hu Chuan's death in 1895, right after the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War, his wife Feng and the young Hu Shih left Taiwan for their ancestral home in Anhui.[13]
In January 1904, when Hu was 11 years old, his mother arranged his marriage to Chiang Tung-hsiu (江冬秀).[14] In the same year, Hu and an elder brother moved to Shanghai seeking a "modern" education.[15]

Academic career[edit]
Hu became a "national scholar" through funds appropriated from the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program.[14] On 16 August 1910, he was sent to study agriculture at Cornell University in the United States[16] In 1912, he changed his major to philosophy and literature, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He was also a member and later a president of the Cosmopolitan Club, an international student organization.[16] While at Cornell, Hu led a campaign to promote the newer, easier to learn Modern Written Chinese which helped spread literacy in China.[17] He also helped found Cornell's extensive library collections of East Asian books and materials.[17]
After receiving his undergraduate degree, he went to study philosophy at Teachers College, Columbia University, in New York City, where he was influenced by his professor, John Dewey and started literary experiments.[18] Hu became Dewey's translator and a lifelong advocate of pragmatic evolutionary change, helping Dewey in his 1919–1921 lectures series in China. Hu returned to lecture in Peking University. During his tenure there, he received support from Chen Duxiu, editor of the influential journal New Youth, quickly gaining much attention and influence. Hu soon became one of the leading and influential intellectuals during the May Fourth Movement and later the New Culture Movement.
He quit New Youth in the 1920s and published several political newspapers and journals with his friends. His most important contribution was the promotion of vernacular Chinese in literature to replace Classical Chinese, which was intended to make it easier for the ordinary person to read.[19] Hu Shih once said, "A dead language can never produce a living literature." [20] The significance of this for Chinese culture was great – as John Fairbank put it, "the tyranny of the classics had been broken."[21] Hu devoted a great deal of energy to rooting his linguistic reforms in China's traditional culture rather than relying on imports from the West. As his biographer Jerome Grieder put it, Hu's approach to China's "distinctive civilization" was "thoroughly critical but by no means contemptuous."[22] For instance, he studied Chinese classical novels, especially the 18th century novel Dream of the Red Chamber, as a way of establishing the vocabulary for a modern standardized language.[23] His Peking University colleague Wen Yuan-ning dubbed Hu a philosophe for his humanistic interests and expertise.[24]
Hu was among the New Culture Movement reformers who welcomed Margaret Sanger's 1922 visit to China.[25]: 24  He personally translated her speech delivered at Beijing National University which stressed the importance of birth control.[25]: 24  Periodicals The Ladies' Journal and The Women's Review published Hu's translation.[25]: 24 
He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1932 and the American Philosophical Society in 1936.[26][27]

Public service[edit]
Hu was the Republic of China's ambassador to the United States between 1938[28] and 1942.[29][30] He was recalled in September 1942 and was replaced by Wei Tao-ming. Hu then served as chancellor of Peking University, at the time called National Peking University, between 1946 and 1948. In 1957, he became the third president of the Academia Sinica in Taipei, a post he retained until his death. He was also chief executive of the Free China Journal, which was eventually shut down for criticizing Chiang Kai-shek.

Death and legacy[edit]
Hu Shih Hall at Cornell University
He died of a heart attack in Nankang, Taipei at the age of 70, and was entombed in Hu Shih Park, adjacent to the Academia Sinica campus. That December, Hu Shih Memorial Hall was established in his memory.[31] It is an affiliate of the Institute of Modern History at the Academia Sinica, and includes a museum, his residence, and the park. Hu Shih Memorial Hall offers audio tour guides in Chinese and English for visitors.
Hu Shih's work fell into disrepute in mainland China until a 1986 article, written by Ji Xianlin, "A Few Words for Hu Shih" (为胡适说几句话), acknowledged Hu Shih's mistakes. This article was sufficiently convincing to many scholars that it led to a re-evaluation of the development of modern Chinese literature.[32] Selection 15 of the Putonghua Proficiency Test is a story about Hu Shih debating the merits of written vernacular Chinese over Literary Chinese.[33]
Hu also claimed that India conquered China culturally for 2000 years via religion. At the same time, Hu criticized Indian religions for holding China back scientifically.[34]
Feng Youlan criticized Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework and ignoring all the schools of Chinese philosophy before the Warring States period. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu made the reader feel as if "the whole Chinese civilization is entirely on the wrong track."[35][36]
As "one of Cornell University’s most notable Chinese alumni,"[17] Hu has several honors there, including the Hu Shih Professorship and Hu Shih Distinguished lecture.[17] Hu Shih Hall, a 103,835 sq ft residence hall, was dedicated at Cornell in 2022.[37][17]

Philosophical contributions[edit]
Pragmatism[edit]
During his time at Columbia, Hu became a supporter of the school of Pragmatism. Hu translated "Pragmatism" as 實驗主義 (shíyànzhǔyì; 'experimental-ism').[a] Hu's taking to the thinking reflected his own philosophical appeals. Before he encountered Dewey's works, he wrote in his diary that he was in a search of "practical philosophy" for the survival of the Chinese people, rather than deep and obscure systems. He was interested in 'methodologies' (術).[38] Hu viewed Pragmatism as a scientific methodology for the study of philosophy. He appreciated the universality of such a scientific approach because he believed that such a methodology transcends the boundary of culture and therefore can be applied anywhere, including China during his time. Hu Shih was not so interested in the content of Dewey's philosophy, caring rather about the method, the attitude, and the scientific spirit.[39]

Hu Shih saw all ideologies and abstract theories only as hypotheses waiting to be tested. The content of ideologies, Hu believed, was shaped by the background, political environment, and even the personality of the theorist. Thus these theories were confined within their temporality. Hu felt that only the attitude and spirit of an ideology could be universally applied. Therefore, Hu criticized any dogmatic application of ideologies. After Hu took over as the chief editor at Weekly Commentary (每周評論) in 1919, he criticized Li Dazhao and engaged in a heated debate regarding ideology and problem (問題與主義論戰). Hu writes in "A Third Discussion of Problems and Isms" (三問題與主義):"Every isms and every theory should be studied, but they can only be viewed as hypothesis, not dogmatic credo; they can only be viewed as a source of reference, not as rules of religion; they can only be viewed as inspiring tools, not as absolute truth that halts any further critical thinkings. Only in this way can people cultivate creative intelligence, become able to solve specific problems, and emancipate from the superstition of abstract words."[40]Throughout the literary works and other scholarships of Hu Shih, the presence of Pragmatism as a method is prevalent. Hu Shih avoided using an ill-defined scientific method. He described his own as experiential, inductive, verification-oriented, and evolutionary.[41]
Hu quotes Dewey's division of thought into five steps.

a felt difficulty
its location and definition
suggestion of possible solution
development of the suggestions
further observation and experiment leads to acceptance or rejection.[41]
In fact, Hu saw his life work as a consistent project of practising the scientific spirit of Pragmatism as a lifestyle.

Skepticism[edit]
For Hu Shih, skepticism and pragmatism are inseparable. In his essay "Introducing My Thoughts" (介紹我自己的思想), he states that Thomas H. Huxley is the one person who most heavily influenced his thoughts.[42] Huxley's agnosticism is the negative precondition to the practical, active problem-solving of Dewey's pragmatism. Huxley's "genetic method" in Hu's writing becomes a "historical attitude," an attitude that ensures one's intellectual independence which also leads to individual emancipation and political freedom.

Chinese intellectual history[edit]
Hu Shih as pictured in The Most Recent Biographies of Chinese DignitariesHu Shih brought the scientific method and the spirit of Skepticism into traditional Chinese textual study (kaozheng), laying the groundwork for contemporary studies of Chinese intellectual history.
In 1919, Hu Shih published the first volume of An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy. The later portion was never finished. Cai Yuanpei, president of Peking University where Hu was teaching at the time, wrote the preface for Outline and pointed out four key features of Hu's work:

Method of proving for dates, validity, and perspectives of methodology
"Cutting off the many schools" (截斷衆流), meaning ignoring all schools before the time of Warring States period and starting with Laozi and Confucius
Equal treatment for Confucianism, Mohism, Mencius, and Xunzi
Systematic studies with chronological orders and juxtaposition that present the evolution of theories
Hu's organization of classical Chinese philosophy imitated Western philosophical history, but the influence of textual study since the time of the Qing dynasty is still present. Especially for the second point, "cutting off the many schools" is a result of the continuous effort of Qing scholarship around ancient textual studies. Since the validity of the ancient texts is questionable and the content of them obscure, Hu decided to leave them out. In fact, before the publication of Outline, Hu was appointed to be the lecturer of History of Classical Chinese Philosophy. His decision of leaving out pre-Warring States philosophy almost caused a riot among students.[43][clarification needed]
In Outline, other philosophical schools of the Warring States were first treated as equal. Hu did not hold Confucianism as the paradigm while treating other schools as heresy. Rather, Hu saw philosophical values within other schools, even those considered to be anti-Confucian, like Mohism. Yu Yingshi commented how this paradigm followed Thomas Kuhn's Enlightenment theory.[44]
Feng Youlan, the author of A History of Chinese Philosophy, criticizes Hu for adopting a pragmatist framework in Outline. Instead of simply laying out the history of Chinese philosophy, Feng claims that Hu criticizes these schools from a pragmatist perspective which makes the reader feel as if "the whole Chinese civilization is entirely on the wrong track."[35] Feng also disagrees with Hu's extensive effort on researching the validity of the resource text. Feng believes that as long as the work itself is philosophically valuable, its validity is not as significant.[36]

Individualism, liberalism, and democracy[edit]
Unlike many of his contemporaries who later joined the Socialist camp, liberalism and democracy had been Hu's political beliefs throughout his life. He firmly believed that the world as a whole was heading toward democracy, despite the changing political landscape.[9][45] Hu defines democracy as a lifestyle in which everyone's value is recognized, and everyone has the freedom to develop a lifestyle of individualism.[46] For Hu, individual achievement does not contradict societal good. In fact, individual achievement contributes to overall social progress, a view that differs from the so-called "selfish individualism."[47] In his essay, "Immortality – My Religion," Hu stresses that although individuals eventually perish physically, one's soul and the effect one has on society are immortal.[48] Therefore, Hu's individualism is a lifestyle in which people are independent and yet social.[49]
Hu sees individual contributions as crucial and beneficial to the system of democracy. In "A Second Discussion on Nation-Building and Autocracy" (再談建國與專治), Hu comments that an autocratic system needs professionals to manage it while democracy relies on the wisdom of the people. When different people's lived experiences come together, no elite politician is needed for coordination, and therefore democracy is, in fact, easy to practice with people who lack political experience. He calls democracy "naive politics" (幼稚政治), a political system that can help cultivate those who participate in it.[50]
Hu also equates democracy with freedom, a freedom that is made possible by tolerance. In a democratic system, people should be free from any political persecution as well as any public pressure. In his 1959 essay "Tolerance and Freedom," Hu Shih stressed the importance of tolerance and claimed that "tolerance is the basis of freedom." In a democratic society, the existence of opposition must be tolerated. Minority rights are respected and protected. People must not destroy or silence the opposition.[51]

The Chinese root of democracy[edit]
A large portion of Hu Shih's scholarship in his later years is dedicated to finding a Chinese root for democracy and liberalism. Many of his writings, including “Historic Tradition for a Democratic China,"[clarification needed] "The Right to Doubt in Ancient Chinese Thought," "Authority and Freedom in the Ancient Asian World" make a similar claim that the democratic spirit is always present within the Chinese tradition.[52] He claimed that Chinese tradition included:

A democratized social structure with an equal inheritance system among sons and the right to rebel under oppressive regimes.
Widespread accessibility of political participation through civil service exams.
Intragovernmental criticism and censorial control formalized by governmental institutions and the Confucian tradition of political criticism.
Constitutionalism and human rights movement[edit]
In 1928, Hu along with Wen Yiduo, Chen Yuan, Liang Shih-chiu, and Xu Zhimo founded the monthly journal Crescent Moon, named after Tagore's prose verse. In March 1929, he learned from Shanghai Special Representatives of National Party Chen De.
Hu criticized and rejected Sun Yat-sen's claim that people are incapable of self-rule and considered democracy itself a form of political education. The legitimacy and the competency of people participating in the political process comes from their lived experience. Sun's government also proposed to punish any "anti-revolutionary" without due process.
Hu wrote an article in Crescent Moon titled "Human Rights and Law" (人權與約法). In the article, Hu called for the establishment of a written constitution that protects the rights of citizens, especially from the ruling government. The government must be held accountable to the constitution. Later in "When Can We Have Constitution – A Question for The Outline of National Reconstruction" (我們什麼時候才可有憲法?—對於《建國大綱》的疑問), Hu criticized the Nationalist government for betraying the ideal of Constitutionalism in The Outline of National Reconstruction.

Criticism of the Chinese Communist Party after 1949[edit]
Hu Shih (left) and Chiang Kai-shek at Academia Sinica, Taipei, April 1958In the early 1950s, the Chinese Communist Party launched a years-long campaign criticizing Hu's thoughts. In response, Hu published many essays in English attacking the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party.[10]
In the writing field, Lu Xun and Hu represented two different political parties. The political differences between the Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party led to significantly different evaluations of the two writers. As a supporter of the Communist Party, Lu Xun was hailed by its leader Mao Zedong as "the greatest and most courageous fighter of the new cultural army." By contrast, Hu Shih was criticized by Communist-leaning historians as "the earliest, the most persistent and most uncompromising enemy of Chinese Marxism and socialist thought." The different evaluations of the two different writers show the complexity between two different political parties in modern China.[11]
Hu's opposition to the Chinese Communist Party was an ideological conflict. As a supporter of Pragmatism, Hu believed that social changes could only happen incrementally. Revolution or any ideologies that claim to solve social problems once and for all are not possible. Such a perspective was present in his early writing, as in the problem versus isms debate. He quotes John Dewey: "progress is not a wholesale matter, but a retail job, to be contracted for and executed in section."

Hu also opposed communism because of his ideological belief in individualism. Hu affirms the individual's right as independent from the collective. The individual has the right to develop freely and diversely without political suppression in the name of uniformity. He writes in "The Conflict of Ideologies":"The desire for uniformity leads to suppression of individual initiative, to the dwarfing of personality and creative effort, to intolerance, oppression, and slavery, and, worst of all, to intellectual dishonesty and moral hypocrisy."[53]In contrast to a Marxist vision of history, Hu's conception of history is pluralistic and particular. In his talk with American economist Charles A. Beard, recorded in his diary, Hu believed the making of history is only coincidental. Since he is a proponent of reformism, pluralism, individualism, and skepticism, Hu's philosophy is irreconcilable with Communist ideology. Hu's later scholarship around the Chinese root of liberalism and democracy is consistent with his anti-CCP writings. In a later manuscript titled "Communism, Democracy, and Cultural Pattern," Hu constructs three arguments from Chinese intellectual history, especially from Confucian and Taoist traditions, to combat the authoritative rule of the Chinese Communist Party:

An almost anarchistic aversion of all governmental interference.
A long tradition of love for freedom and fighting for freedom – especially for intellectual freedom and religious freedom, but also for the freedom of political criticism.
A traditional exaltation of the individual's right to doubt and question things – even the most sacred things.[54]

Therefore, Hu regards the dictatorship of the Chinese Communist Party as not only "unhistorical", but also "un-Chinese".

Global policy[edit]
Along with Albert Einstein, Hu was one of the sponsors of the Peoples' World Convention (PWC), also known as Peoples' World Constituent Assembly (PWCA), which took place from 1950 to 1951 at Palais Electoral in Geneva, Switzerland.[55][56]

Writings[edit]
Essays[edit]
Hu Shih's works are listed chronologically at the Hu Shih Memorial Hall website.[57] His early essays include:

A Republic for China (in The Cornell Era Vol. 44 No. 4) (PDF). Ithaca: Cornell University. 1912. pp. 240–242.
The International Student Movement. Boston. 1913. pp. 37–39.
胡適文存 [Collected Essays of Hu Shih] (in Chinese). 1921.
Hu was an advocate for the literary revolution of the era, a movement which aimed to replace scholarly classical Chinese in writing with the vernacular spoken language, and to cultivate and stimulate new forms of literature. In an article originally published in New Youth in January 1917 titled "A Preliminary Discussion of Literature Reform",[58] Hu originally emphasized eight guidelines that all Chinese writers should take to heart in writing:

Write with substance. By this, Hu meant that literature should contain real feeling and human thought. This was intended to be a contrast to the recent poetry with rhymes and phrases that Hu saw as being empty.
Do not imitate the ancients. Literature should not be written in the styles of long ago, but rather in the modern style of the present era.
Respect grammar. Hu did not elaborate at length on this point, merely stating that some recent forms of poetry had neglected proper grammar.
Reject melancholy. Recent young authors often chose grave pen names, and wrote on such topics as death. Hu rejected this way of thinking as being unproductive in solving modern problems.
Eliminate old clichés. The Chinese language has always had numerous chengyu used to describe events. Hu implored writers to use their own words in descriptions, and deplored those who did not.
Do not use allusions. By this, Hu was referring to the practice of comparing present events with historical events even when there is no meaningful analogy.
Do not use couplets or parallelism. Though these forms had been pursued by earlier writers, Hu believed that modern writers first needed to learn the basics of substance and quality, before returning to these matters of subtlety and delicacy.
Do not avoid popular expressions or popular forms of characters. This rule, perhaps the most well-known, ties in directly with Hu's belief that modern literature should be written in the vernacular, rather than in Classical Chinese. He believed that this practice had historical precedents, and led to greater understanding of important texts.
In April 1918, Hu published a second article in New Youth, this one titled "Constructive Literary Revolution – A Literature of National Speech". In it, he simplified the original eight points into just four:

Speak only when you have something to say. This is analogous to the first point above.
Speak what you want to say and say it in the way you want to say it. This combines points two through six above.
Speak what is your own and not that of someone else. This is a rewording of point seven.
Speak in the language of the time in which you live. This refers again to the replacement of Classical Chinese with the vernacular language.
In the July 15 New Youth issue, Hu published an essay entitled, Chastity (贞操问题). In the traditional Chinese context, this refers not only to virginity before marriage, but specifically to women remaining chaste before they marry and after their husband's death (守贞). He wrote that this is an unequal and illogical view of life, that there is no natural or moral law upholding such a practice, that chastity is a mutual value for both men and women, and that he vigorously opposes any legislation favoring traditional practices on chastity. There was a movement to introduce traditional Confucian value systems into law at the time.
His 1947 essay We Must Choose Our Own Direction (我们必须选择我们的方向) was devoted to liberalism. He held the Jiaxu manuscript (甲戌本; Jiǎxū běn) for many years until his death.

Academic works[edit]
Among academic works of Hu Shih are:

An Outline History of Chinese Philosophy. Vol. 1 (1919).
The Chinese Renaissance: The Haskell Lectures, 1933. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1934).
Hu Shih's Recent Writings on Scholarship (胡適論學近著). (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1935). Including essay "Introducing My Thoughts" (介紹我自己的思想).
"The Conflicts of Ideologies" in The Annuals of American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 28, November 1941.
Autobiography[edit]
The 184-page Autobiography at Forty (四十自述) is the only autobiography written by Hu Shih himself.[59]

Fiction prose and poetry[edit]
In 1920, Hu Shih published the collection of his poems Experiments (Changshi ji).[60]
The following excerpt is from a poem titled Dream and Poetry, written in vernacular Chinese by Hu. It illustrates how he applied those guidelines to his own work.




Chinese original



English Translation[61][62]




都是平常情感。
都是平常言語。
偶然碰著個詩人。
變幻出多少新奇詩句！



It's all ordinary feelings,
All ordinary words.
By chance they encounter a poet,
Turning out infinite new verses.




醉過才知酒濃。
愛過才知情重；
你不能做我的詩。
正如我不能做你的夢



Once intoxicated, one learns the strength of wine,
Once smitten, one learns the power of love:
You cannot write my poems
Just as I cannot dream your dreams.


His prose included works like The Life of Mr. Close Enough (差不多先生傳), a piece criticizing Chinese society which centers around the extremely common Chinese language phrase '差不多' (chàbuduō), which means something like "close enough" or "just about right":

As Mr. Chabuduo ("Close Enough") lay dying, he uttered in an uneven breath, "The living and the dead are cha.........cha........buduo (are just about the same), and as long as everything is cha.........cha........buduo, then things will be fine. Why...........be............too serious?" Following these final words, he took his last gasp of air.[63]
The Marriage (终身大事) was one of the first plays written in the new literature style. Published in the March 1919 issue (Volume 6 Number 3) of New Youth, this Hu Shih's one-act play highlights the problems of traditional marriages arranged by parents. The female protagonist eventually leaves her family to escape the marriage in the story.

Vernacular style[edit]
Hu Shih was part of the Chinese language reform movement and used the vernacular style in writing articles. The opposite style of writing is Classical Chinese, and one of the key leaders of this language was Zhang Shizhao. Hu Shih and Zhang Shizhao had only a ten-year age difference, but the men seemed to be of differing generations.[64]
In October 1919, after visiting Wu Luzhen in China, Hu Shih said with emotion: "In the last ten years, only deceased personalities like Song Jiaoren, Cai E, and Wu Luzhen have been able to maintain their great reputation. The true features of living personalities are soon detected. This is because the times change too quickly. If a living personality does not try his utmost, he falls behind and soon becomes 'against the time'''.[64] In Hu Shih's ideals, only dead people can hold their reputation; the world will soon know the real value and personality of a person if they do not follow the times. They will fall back in time soon if they are not trying to find changes that encourage writers in old China to follow the new revolution and start using the new vernacular style of writing. They cannot stay in the old style; otherwise, they will fall back in time. Furthermore, Hu Shih meant that China needed more new things.
Zhang was the biggest 'enemy' of the vernacular style, According to Liang Souming: "Lin Shu and Zhang Shizhao were two most significant people against vernacular style of writing in history".[64] But in fact, Hu Shih and Zhang Shizhao had a big age difference; when Zhang was at work in Shanghai, Hu was only a middle school student.

May Fourth Movement[edit]
Hu Shih participated in the May Fourth Movement, marking the beginning of modern China. Hu had a vision of the May Fourth Movement in China as part of a global shift in philosophy, led by Western countries. The global nature of the movement, in Hu's eyes, was particularly important, given China's relatively recent status as a global power. During the May Fourth Movement, Hu's political position shifted dramatically. As fellow thinkers and students of the movement looked towards socialism, Hu also gained a more favorable view of the collective, centralized organization of groups like the Soviet Union and the Third International. After the early 1930s, he changed back to his earlier positions, which put more weight on individualism. Hu then began criticizing communism such as Mao's government and the Soviet Union. During the chaotic period this movement developed, Hu felt pessimism and a sense of alienation.[65]
Towards the end of Hu's life, he expressed disappointment at the politicization of the May Fourth Movement, which he felt was counter to the primarily philosophical and linguistic issues that drove him to participate in it. No matter how Hu's position shifted through the course of the Movement, he always put the May Fourth Movement in a global, albeit Eurocentric, context.[66] Despite the implications of the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shih ultimately expressed regret that he was unable to play a larger role in his nation's history.[65]

Weiman attended Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado. He signed to play college baseball at the University of Kansas.[1] During his high school career, he played in three Colorado Rockies Futures games.[2] In 2014, as a senior, he went 7–0 with a 1.40 ERA and was named to the All-Colorado baseball team.[3] Undrafted out of high school in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, he enrolled at Kansas.
In 2015, as a freshman at Kansas, Weiman appeared in 21 games (seven starts), going 2–7 with a 6.75 ERA.[4] As a sophomore in 2016, he became a full-time starter, appearing in 17 games in which he went 2–7 with a 6.82 ERA.[5] In 2017, in Weiman's junior season, he moved to the bullpen where he greatly improved, pitching to a 5–1 record with a 2.80 ERA, striking out 55 batters in 45 relief innings pitched. After his junior year, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the eighth round of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft.[6][7]

Professional career[edit]
Pittsburgh Pirates[edit]
Weiman signed with Pittsburgh and made his professional debut with the West Virginia Black Bears of the Low–A New York–Penn League, going 4–3 with a 3.78 ERA in 21 relief appearances.[8] He began the 2018 season with the West Virginia Power of the Single–A South Atlantic League and was promoted to the Bradenton Marauders of the High–A Florida State League and the Altoona Curve of the Double–A Eastern League during the year. In 67 relief innings pitched between the three clubs, he went 4–1 with a 2.42 ERA and 77 strikeouts.[9] After the season, he played for the Surprise Saguaros of the Arizona Fall League and was named to the Fall Stars Game.[10][11] Weiman was a non-roster invitee to 2019 spring training.[12] He returned to Altoona to begin 2019 and was promoted to the Indianapolis Indians of the Triple–A International League in June after pitching to a 1.86 ERA over 19+1⁄3 relief innings.[13][14] Over eight relief appearances with Indianapolis, Weiman went 0–1 with a 4.63 ERA. He missed nearly all of the last two months of the season due to injury.[15]
Weiman did not play a minor league game in 2020 since the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[16] For the 2021 season, he returned to Indianapolis.[17] He missed playing time in August due to injury.[18] Over 35 relief appearances, Weiman went 5–0 with a 4.76 ERA and 45 strikeouts over 45+1⁄3 innings.[19] He returned to the Indians to begin the 2022 season.[20] On June 27, 2022, he was released.[21]

Seattle Mariners[edit]
On July 6, 2022, the Seattle Mariners signed Weiman to a minor league contract and assigned him to the Double-A Arkansas Travelers.[22] Over 33 relief appearances between the Indians and Travelers, he went 3-1 with a 4.47 ERA, 42 strikeouts, and six walks over 44+1⁄3 innings.[23] On December 5, Weiman re-signed with the Mariners on a minor league deal. Weiman spent the 2023 season with the Triple–A Tacoma Rainiers, making 44 appearances out of the bullpen and recording a 5.17 ERA with 53 strikeouts across 54.0 innings of work. Weiman elected free agency following the season on November 6.[24]

Chicago Cubs[edit]
On February 2, 2024, Weiman signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs.[25]

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blake_Weiman&oldid=1206137123"William Howell Pegram (August 18, 1846 – April 30, 1928) was an American chemist and educator.

Biography[edit]
Born Chalk Level, Harnett County, North Carolina, Pegram fought in the American Civil War on the side of the Confederacy. His combat experience and subsequent internment on the Confederacy's defeat left him with a military bearing and, untainted by cynicism, an enthusiasm to be part of the Reconstruction.
After spending the next four years on his father's farm, he entered Trinity College (now Duke University) in 1869 and, even as an undergraduate, assisted in the teaching of science and English literature. Graduating in 1873, by 1874 he was professor of natural science with responsibility for the teaching of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering. It was about this time that he began courting Emma, the daughter of college president Rev. Braxton Craven. As an uncredited report put it:

In 1873 a bright young man, just out of college and full of  the fine enthusiasm of youth was appointed to teach the sciences. It did not take him long to doff his coat, roll up his sleeves and resolve to make something happen. This youth was William H. Pegram.  The records do not show whether this fine enthusiasm was fundamentally excited by a love of pure science or by a love of the President's daughter. The fact is well-established, however, that through it he won the unqualified approval of the President and also of the President's daughter, and thereby won for himself a career in science.
Pegram married Emma in 1875 and they parented five children, most famously George Braxton Pegram. Tight finances at the college demanded that Pegram was still teaching English until 1879 and it was not until 1900 that he could devote himself to his principle love of chemistry.

The consecration of the third Cluny Abbey by Pope Urban II[1]
By the 10th century, Christianity had spread throughout much of Europe and Asia. The Church in England was becoming well established, with its scholarly monasteries, and the Roman Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church were continuing their separation, ultimately culminating in the Great Schism.


Pre-scholastic theology[edit]
With the division and decline of the Carolingian Empire, notable theological activity was preserved in some of the cathedral schools that had begun to rise to prominence under it. Intellectual influences from the Arabic world (including works of classical authors preserved by Islamic scholars) percolated into the Christian West via Spain, influencing such theologians as Gerbert of Aurillac, who went on to become Pope Sylvester II and mentor to Otto III.  (Otto was the fourth ruler of the Germanic Ottonian Holy Roman Empire, which succeeded the Carolingian Empire.)

Monasticism[edit]
Monastic reform movement[edit]
A view of the Abbey of Cluny
From the 6th century onward most of the monasteries in the West were of the Benedictine Order. Owing to the stricter adherence to a reformed Benedictine Rule, the abbey of Cluny in France became the acknowledged leader of western monasticism from the later 10th century. A sequence of highly competent abbots of Cluny were statesmen on an international level. The monastery of Cluny itself became the grandest, most prestigious and best endowed monastic institution in Europe.  Cluny created a large federated order in which the administrators of subsidiary houses served as deputies of the abbot of Cluny and answered to him. Free of lay and episcopal interference, responsible only to the papacy, the Cluniac spirit was a revitalising influence on the Norman church. The height of Cluniac influence was from the second half of the 10th century through the early 12th.
The Cluniac reform of monasteries that began in 910 placed abbots under the direct control of the pope rather than the secular control of feudal lords, thus eliminating a major source of corruption. This sparked a great monastic renewal.[2] Monasteries, convents and cathedrals still operated virtually all schools and libraries and often functioned as credit establishments promoting economic growth.[3][4]
Monastic contributions to western society included the teaching of metallurgy, the introduction of new crops, the invention of musical notation and the creation and preservation of literature.[5]

First Patriarchate of Bulgarian Church[edit]
Following two decisive victories over the Byzantines at Acheloos (near the present-day city of Pomorie) and Katasyrtai (near Constantinople), Bulgaria declared the autonomous Bulgarian Archbishopric as autocephalous and elevated it to the rank of Patriarchate at an ecclesiastical and national council held in 919. After Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire signed a peace treaty in 927 that concluded the 20-year-long war between them, the Patriarchate of Constantinople recognised the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and acknowledged its patriarchal dignity.[6][7]
The Bulgarian Patriarchate was the first autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church, preceding the autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church (1219) by 300 years and of the Russian Orthodox Church (1596) by some 600 years. It was the sixth Patriarchate after the Pentarchy patriarchates of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. The seat of the Patriarchate was the new Bulgarian capital of Preslav.
On April 5, 972, Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces conquered and burned down Preslav, and captured Bulgarian Tsar Boris II. Patriarch Damyan managed to escape, initially to Sredetz (Sofia) in western Bulgaria. In the coming years, the residence of the Bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between the next Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Comitopuli, and the Byzantine Empire.  Patriarch German resided consecutively in the medieval Bulgarian cities of Maglen (Almopia) and Voden (Edessa) (both in present-day north-western Greece), and Prespa (in present-day southern North Macedonia).  Around 990, the next patriarch, Philip, moved to Ohrid (in present-day south-western North Macedonia), which became the permanent seat of the Patriarchate.

Spread of Christianity[edit]
Poland[edit]
Christianization of Poland. A.D. 966., by Jan Matejko, 1888–89 (Royal Castle, Warsaw)
Main article: Christianization of Poland See also: Pagan reaction in Poland
The  "Baptism of Poland" (Polish: Chrzest Polski) in 966 refers to the baptism of Mieszko I, the first ruler of a united Polish state. His baptism was followed by the building of churches and the establishment of an ecclesiastical hierarchy. Mieszko saw baptism as a way of strengthening his hold on power, with the active support he could expect from the bishops, as well as a unifying force for the Polish people. Mieszko's action proved highly successful; by the 13th century, Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion in Poland.

Hungary[edit]
In the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Hungary (which was larger than modern day Hungary) was Christianized between 970 and 1038. Initially the Byzantine Christianity had a significant influence on the Hungarians, but the decisive steps towards the adoption of the new faith were taken by Géza, the head of the Hungarian tribal federation (c. 972–997) who supported Western missionaries. The reception of Christianity was enforced by legislation in the reign of Géza's son, Stephen I (997–1038).
Stephen promulgated Roman Catholicism as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the Apostolic Kings. The Catholic Church in Hungary remained strong through the centuries, and the Archbishop of Esztergom was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as prince-primate (hercegprímás) of Hungary.

Kievan Rus'[edit]
Baptism of Vladimir by Viktor Vasnetsov
Main article: Christianization of Kievan Rus'
The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of other East Slavic peoples, most notably the Rus', predecessors of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians.
After the First Bulgarian Empire was converted to Christianity, it started a massive missionary expansion north and east. As a result, it was able to convert and help convert many East Slavic peoples and introduce to them Bulgarian books and Church literature in Bulgarian, most notably the Rus' (Ruthenians), predecessors of Belarusians, Russians, and Ukrainians/Rusyns. By the beginning of the 11th century most of the pagan Slavic world, including Ukraine, Russia, Bulgaria and Serbia, had been converted to Christianity.
Between the 8th and the 13th century the area was settled by the Kievan Rus'. Its Christianization was successful in the 10th century, when about 980 Vladimir the Great was baptized at Chersonesos. He was also married to the Byzantine princess Anna Porphyrogeneta, the sister of the Byzantine Emperor Basil II. In 988, the Christian Church in Rus' territorially fell under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople after it was officially adopted as the state religion. The Christianisation of Kievan Rus' firmly allied it with the Byzantine Empire. The Greek learning and book culture was adopted in Kiev and other centres of the country. Churches started to be built on the Byzantine model.

A conventional keyboard has, for instance, only one key and pitch for C♯ and D♭, but an enharmonic keyboard would have two different keys and pitches for these notes. Traditionally, such keyboards use black split keys to express both notes,[a][b] but diatonic white keys may also be split.[c]
As an important device to compose, play and study enharmonic music,[d]
enharmonic keyboards are capable of producing microtones and have separate keys for at least some pairs of not equal pitches that must be  enharmonically equal in conventional keyboard instruments.[3]


The term (divergence of scholar opinions)[edit]
"Enharmonic keyboard" is a term used by scholars in their studies of enharmonic keyboard instruments (organ, harpsichord, piano,[4]
harmonium and synthesizer) with reference to a keyboard with more than 12 keys per octave. Scholarly consensus about the term's precise definition currently has not been established.[citation needed]
The New Grove Dictionary (2001) defines an "enharmonic keyboard" as "a keyboard with more than 12 keys and sounding more than 12 different pitches in the octave",[5]
however the article does not specify the origin of the term. Rasch (2002) suggested applying the term "enharmonic keyboard" more precisely, to keyboards with 29–31 keys per octave.[6][page needed]
Barbieri (2007), in his turn, raised the objection that this use of the term is contrary to early theoretical works.[7][e][f]
Some modern scholars [e.g. Wraight & Stembridge (1994)] describe instruments with such keyboards as split-keyed instruments.[9][10][11]

Known realizations[edit]
Odoevsky's enharmonic klavitsin (Russia, 1864), in fact piano with 19 keys per octave
Vicentino's enharmonic keyboard (Italy, 1555) with version of tuning in cents
Schematic representation of Fokker's microtonal keyboard[12] for a 31 EDO pipe organ (Fokker organ) with two manuals and pedal, built by him
Joseph Alley's enharmonic reed organ (U.S., c. 1867, 5 limit J.I. non-closed) 
von Oettingen's orthotonophonium (Germany, 1914). 53 EDO, 60 keys per octave
One of the first instruments with an enharmonic keyboard was the archicembalo built by Nicola Vicentino, an Italian Renaissance composer and music theorist. The archicembalo had 36 keys per octave and was very well suited for meantone temperament.[g]
Vicentino also had made one arciorgano in Rome and one arciorgano in Milan. Both pipe organs were equipped with enharmonic keyboards, like those of the archicembalo.[14] None of Vicentino's instruments survive.
Many instruments with enharmonic keyboards were built during the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Most composers and performers who used these instruments are virtually unknown today. Among them are Johann Kaspar Kerll's teacher, Giovanni Valentini, who played a harpsichord with 77 keys for 4 octaves (19 keys per octave plus one extra C), and Friedrich Suppig,[15][page needed] published one of the definitive works for an instrument with an enharmonic keyboard: The Fantasia of the Labyrinthus Musicus, which is a multi-sectional composition that makes use of all 24 keys and is intended for a keyboard with 31 notes per octave and pure major thirds.
With the advent of microtonal music in the 20th century, instruments with enharmonic keyboards became more fashionable, as did early and Baroque music for such instruments. For performance and recording purposes, either old instruments are reconstructed or two recordings of two differently tuned instruments are combined in one, thus creating an effect of an enharmonic keyboard.
Isomorphic note-layouts are a class of enharmonic keyboard, opened in 1721 by Ivo Salzinger's Tastatura nova perfecta, Germany.[16] One isomorphic note-layout, the Wicki, when mapped to a hexagonal array of buttons, is particularly well-suited to the control of enharmonic scales. The orientation of its hexagonal columns of octaves and tempered perfect fifths place all the notes of every well-formed scale – pentatonic (cardinality 5), diatonic (cardinality 7), chromatic (cardinality 12), and enharmonic (cardinality 19) – in a tight, contiguous cluster.
The notes of each progressively-higher cardinality are appended to the outer edges of the lower-cardinality scale, such that each well-formed scale's note-controlling buttons are embedded, unchanged, within the set of those controlling the higher-cardinality scales. Hence, the skills gained in learning to play chromatic music on a chromatic Wicki keyboard can be applied, without modification, to performance on an enharmonic Wicki keyboard.
Isomorphic keyboards were not discovered until the latter half of the 19th century.[citation needed]

Notes[edit]


^ 
"The concept of enharmonicity arises from the fact that certain tone pairs seem to refer to almost identical pitches. For example, from a given C we ... will find that the pitches of C♯ and D♭ are close to each other (exactly how close will depend on the methods we allow for finding them). C♯ and D♭ are obviously not identical, but they are close enough to be treated as identical in certain musical settings. Therefore, they are enharmonically equivalent. An enharmonic instrument is an instrument where multiple ways of producing enharmonically equivalent tones are available. For example, an enharmonic keyboard could have separate keys for C♯ and D♭, as well as for each tone in other enharmonic pairs such as D♯ / E♭, F♯ / G♭, G♯ / A♭ and A♯ / B♭. An enharmonic keyboard is thus guaranteed to have more than 12 keys per octave."[1]

^ "Enharmonic instruments should be understood as musical instruments presenting a number of pitches per octave that significantly surpasses the twelve notes of the standard western tuning systems (equal temperament, meantone tuning or whatever). This begins with harpsichords or organs with a few split upper keys, goes to keyboards with 17, 19, 31 or 43 notes per octave and ends with theoretical systems and ideas for instruments (less often the instruments themselves) up to far over 100 pitches per octave"[1] 

^ "Note, however, that the extra keys need not be found among the sharps and flats. For example, Barbieri (2008), p. 20 shows an organ from the end of the 1400s with no extra black keys but with two E keys, one suitable for use in an E major chord, and another better fitted as the third in a C major chord".[2]

^ 
"Enharmonic music is music ... that is mostly to be found in the surroundings of enharmonic instruments. Without those instruments nearby, it makes little sense to produce such music".[2]

^ 
The only theoretical evidence that agrees with Rasch's usage is found in one (not yet published) manuscript by some Benedetto Bresciani, written c. 1719.

As for historical evidence, confusion has often reigned over the terminology of split-keyed instruments, which were sometimes called chromatic, sometimes enharmonic. The builders (or persons who only described the construction) of such keyboard instruments often gave them names without any reference to genus, like archicembalo (Nicola Vicentino), cembalo pentarmonico (Giovanni Battista Doni), clavicymbalum universale (Michael Praetorius) or even simply clauocembalo (that is clavicembalo; Gioseffo Zarlino.</ref>

The Federal Hotel is located at 23-25 William Street in Fremantle, Western Australia, opposite the Fremantle Town Hall.
The three-storey hotel was designed by George Charles Inskip (1840-1931) and built by Jordine and Ruthven for James Herbert Junior (1841-1893).[1][2] Herbert was the proprietor of the Rockingham Arms and the Freemasons Hotel.[3] Inskip was a Melbourne based architect, who came to Western Australia in 1879 to superintend work on Edmund Blacket’s design for St George's Cathedral, Perth. Inskip subsequently was commissioned to design a new Union Bank in Albany in 1884. Inskip also designed the Union Bank buildings in Perth, Fremantle, Roebourne and Geraldton.[4] At the time it was built, the Federal was described in the press as being “far in advance of anything so far erected in Western Australia and equal to the best in the sister colonies”.
In August 1888 Herbert filed for bankruptcy and the receivers subsequently arranged for the property to be transferred to Alexander Forrest and Sir John Forrest.[5]  In 1904, local architect, Joseph Herbert Eales (1864-1957) was responsible for extensive additions to the Federal Hotel,[6][7] including the front verandahs and the western wing, which extends towards the rear of the premises.
On 8 February 1927 the hotel was the scene of a double murder, when Lillian Josephine Martin and her four-year-old son Daniel Charles were found dead in an upstairs bedroom of the building.[8] Martin, her son and Jack Thomas had booked into the hotel under the name of Mr and Mrs Martin on 7 February. Thomas left the hotel at 7:30 am the following day and the bodies of Martin and her son were discovered at 11:00 am by a house maid. Martin had been strangled and her son's throat had been cut. An extensive search was then undertaken by the police for Thomas, whose body was later found near the Mends Street Jetty in South Perth on 13 February. The coroner subsequently concluded that Thomas had committed both murders and then committed suicide by shooting himself with a revolver.[9]
In 1989 the hotel was renamed to Rosie O'Grady's, an Irish themed pub. In 1995 the building underwent internal alterations, reconstruction of the two-storey front verandah and repainting of the front façade, with the works being carried out by Maxwell Cox Architects. Further internal changes were made in 2001.
In January 2016 Rosie O'Grady's closed for business[10] and the hotel was re-opened as the Federal Hotel.[11]

Heritage listings[edit]
On 21 October 1980 the building was included on the Register of the National Estate and 1 August 1983 it was classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA).
The City of Fremantle included it on their Municipal Inventory on 18 September 2000 and on their Heritage List on 8 March 2007.

The Nelson Mandela Championship was a golf tournament, played for the first time in December 2012. It was played in Durban, South Africa and was co-sanctioned by the European Tour and the Sunshine Tour. It was sponsored by the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. It was the first event of the 2013 European Tour.[1]
The first ever event was reduced to 36 holes due to rain and in order for the tournament to commence the course was reduced to a par 65 and was 1600 yards shorter. The tournament ended in a playoff. Eduardo de la Riva dropped out with a bogey on the first extra hole, Steve Webster made a bogey on the second extra hole, and Scott Jamieson won with a par. It was his first European Tour victory in his 65th event. 
The second event was a week after Nelson Mandela's death. His funeral was on Sunday 15 December so the tournament was moved forward one day and played Wednesday through Saturday, 11–14 December. Again, this tournament was suspended several times due to a water-logged course and shortened to 54 holes, with one of the holes being shortened from a par 5 to a par 4. Spain's Jorge Campillo and South Africa's Colin Nel shot 59 in the second round, but the European Tour considers them unofficial after the use preferred lies, which allowed players to lift, clean and place their ball.[2] South Africa's Dawie van der Walt earned his second European Tour win.

Pandolfo Petrucci
Pandolfo Petrucci (14 February 1452 – 21 May 1512) was a ruler of the Italian Republic of Siena during the Renaissance.


Biography[edit]
Petrucci was born and raised in Siena, into an aristocratic family of wealthy merchants. When Petrucci was still a child, in 1456, his family was forced into exile due to his father, Bartolomeo, being involved in a failed conspiracy against Cesare Borgia.[1] The family moved to Pisa. In 1480 the presence in Tuscany of the army of Duke Alfonso of Calabria allowed the exiles to return to the city.[2]
In 1481, he was admitted to the People's Council with his brothers Alessandro and Vittorio. In October 1482 he married Eufrasia Martinozzi. Petrucci was exiled from his home in 1483 for being a member of the city's Noveschi political faction, which had fallen out of favor with the rulers of Siena. He joined his brother Vittorio in Paganico, where the family had property. He then moved to Montepulciano, before joining his brother Giacoppo in Pisa.[2]
By 1487, he had married his second wife, Aurelia Borghesi, daughter of Niccolo, one of the most important men in Siena. When the Noveschi returned to prominence, Petrucci seized power in a coup,[3] with the support of Cardinal Piccolomini, nephew of Pope Pius II, and assistance from his brother Giacopo (d. 1497). He later became captain of the city guard in 1495. He was part of the committee that hired Francesco di Giorgio Martini to renovate the city's defenses. 

Rise to power[edit]
The Abduction of Helen, painting by Girolamo Genga, originally in Petrucci's palace in Siena.
When his brother Giacopo died in 1497, Petrucci assumed all of his offices and seized control of his fortune. With his father-in-law's backing, Petrucci assumed a number of public offices and gained a vast amount of political power.  He subsequently used this power to sell public offices or to give them to his lackeys, a strategy which allowed him to become the most powerful man in Siena. However, Petrucci's power and his organization of followers in Siena's government gained him many enemies, including his father-in-law.  Niccolò and other influential citizens of Siena conspired to assassinate Petrucci, but Petrucci uncovered the plot and had Niccolò murdered in 1500.[1]
With his enemies out of the way, Petrucci ruled as absolute tyrant over Siena.  Petrucci subsequently stopped selling public offices in order to consolidate his own power.  Although a brutal authoritarian and absolutist, Petrucci was careful to pacify the people of Siena by improving the city's economy and encouraging the advancement of art.[1]  He also managed to avoid a war with Florence, which had been at odds with Siena for over a century due to a dispute over Siena's control of Montepulciano.[2]
When France and Spain invaded the Italian Peninsula, Petrucci became involved in a number of political intrigues. During this time period, Petrucci tried to gain the powerful Cesare Borgia's trust by diplomatically procuring French-controlled Piombino for Borgia.  However, he secretly plotted against Borgia in the hopes of increasing his own power.  Borgia, who had never trusted Petrucci, learned of the Sienese tyrant's plans and invited him to a meeting at Senigallia in 1502, where Petrucci would have been assassinated along with Cesare's other enemies.  Petrucci suspected his life was in danger and avoided the meeting, but nevertheless fled Siena in January 1503 in order to appease Borgia.  He subsequently resided in Lucca.  With the assistance of his ally King Louis XII of France, however, Petrucci was returned to power two months later. Je later, in 1509, sent a small military contingent to assist the French against Venice in the Battle of Agnadello.

Later years[edit]
Before his death, Petrucci was known to have plotted in secret with Spain and Pope Julius II against his old allies, the French. He was also rumored to have had Pope Pius III poisoned in 1503.
With Borgia's death in 1507, Petrucci became one of the most powerful men in Italy.  In his final years, Petrucci supported Pisa militarily in its war against Florence.  However, Pope Julius II and Spain forced Petrucci to make peace with Florence, to which he reluctantly gave the territory of Montepulciano in 1512.  In return, the pope made Petrucci's son, Alfonso Petrucci, a cardinal. Later that year, Petrucci handed control of Siena over to his son, Borghese Petrucci, and died shortly afterwards in San Quirico d'Orcia, Italy.[4]
He was a generous patron of the Basilica dell'Osservanza, where he was buried next to his father.
Following Pandolfo's death, the Petrucci family ruled Siena until 1524.

Waverley Park.
Waverley Park is a public park located in the north end of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. It is the second oldest municipal park in Ontario. The park forms the centre of the Waverley Park Heritage Conservation District, a collection of historical homes, churches, schools, and other buildings at the centre of Port Arthur.
The property was surveyed and set aside as parkland by the Crown Lands Department, in the original ordnance survey of the Prince Arthur's Landing town plot in 1871. It was given to the city of Port Arthur in 1907 on the condition that is "not be alienated or leased and that no buildings be erected on it except municipal buildings".
The most notable features of Waverley Park include its giant cottonwood trees, which stand as much as 40 m above the park. In recent years, many have been removed due to advanced age and disease. Other notable features include a fountain, cenotaph, and bandshell. The park is between Waverley Street and Red River Road in Thunder Bay, and is located between two historic schools — Port Arthur Collegiate Institute and Port Arthur Central School — the latter is now home to Magnus Theatre.


Hogarth Fountain[edit]
The centrepiece of Waverley Park is the Hogarth Fountain. A gift from the wife of a prominent soldier and politician, Major General Donald McDonald Hogarth (1879–1950), the fountain originated from the Luton Hoo Mansion, in the town of Hitchin, Hertfordshire, England. Its ten tonne Portland stone foundation dates back to 1790. The fountain was purchased and shipped to Waverly Park in 1964, and dedicated on 5 June 1965.
The fountain features nude children in a renaissance style, along with bundles of wheat and garlands of flowers. The water pours from the mouths of lions mounted above leaves which deflect the water away from the center and out into the pool.
The fountain has not been working since 2019.

Rotary Thundershell[edit]
The Rotary Thundershell was a large wooden bandshell located in the west corner of the park, behind the gymnasium of Port Arthur Collegiate Institute. The bandshell was built in 1984 and for many years was home to the weekly Summer in the Parks concert series. Its construction was financed using donations from various local groups and companies, which are commemorated on a plaque located on the bandshell. The bandshell was replaced in 2018 by a multipurpose bandstand constructed by Finnway Contracting and paid for with funds raised by The Coalition For Waverley Park. The Coalition For Waverley Park and The ThunderBay Musician's Association hold a Waverley Park Concert Series on Monday evenings during July and August.

Port Arthur Cenotaph[edit]
The Port Arthur Cenotaph
The Port Arthur Cenotaph was originally built in remembrance of local soldiers who died during World War I, and was updated for both the Second World War and the Korean War. It was erected in 1925 by the McCallum Granite Company of Kingston, Ontario, through the efforts of the Women's Canadian Club at a cost of $8,000.[1]
The design of the cenotaph is simple. Both immense and yet stark, with simplistic lines, the monument is identical on either side.
The inscription reads:

ERECTED IN COMMEMORATION OF THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THIS CITY WHO DIED ON THE FIELD OF HONOUR IN WAR THAT CANADA MIGHT MAINTAIN HER HERITAGE OF FREEDOM
Below it are the dates of World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.

Magnus Theatre[edit]
Main article: Magnus Theatre
Founded in 1971, Magnus Theatre relocated to the old Port Arthur Central School in 2001. Located on the eastern corner of the park, the 123-year-old structure was expanded in 1999 to accommodate the theatre. After renovations landscaping was designed to incorporate it into the existing Waverley Park. The grounds of Magnus Theatre feature a memorial garden in the shape of the former schools baseball diamond, lighted pathways, and various trees and shrubs.

Memorial Garden[edit]
Memorial Garden - August 28, 2010
The memorial garden has stones laid out in the shape of a baseball diamond. The bases and home plate are represented by cubic stones with inscriptions. A large, irregularly shaped rock located in the centre represents the pitcher's mound with a plaque that reads:

FIELD OF DREAMS
CENTRAL SCHOOL BASEBALL DIAMOND
IN MEMORY OF VISIONARIES
Jim Griffis
Wilda Lowcock
Clark MacDonald
Bones McCormack
John Fancy
THE COALITION FOR WAVERLEY PARK

2003
Each of the stones that represent the baseball plates have inscriptions that read as follows:


Home: A JEWEL IN THE HEART OF THE CITY
First: WE DREAMED OF THIS SPECIAL PLACE
Second: FOR YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN TO SHARE
Third: THE PEACE BENEATH THE TREES


Port Arthur Collegiate Institute[edit]
Port Arthur Collegiate Institute towers over Waverley Park.
See also: Port Arthur Collegiate Institute
At the westernmost end of Waverley Park is the former Port Arthur Collegiate Institute, which was the oldest high school west of Toronto, Ontario. The large castle-like edifice was constructed in 1909-10 of Simpson Island sandstone, and incorporated medieval and Flemish architectural features. Being located on a hill, it has a very imposing nature when viewed from the park below. Its site was chosen by Montreal landscape architect Frederick Todd, and its architects were Young and Simpson of Toronto.[2]
The hill on which the school is located was the shore of the post glacial lake which preceded Lake Superior, and is composed mainly of beach sand.

The Arthurian gas fields are small natural gas producing areas in the UK sector of the southern North Sea, their names are associated with the legend of King Arthur. The fields started gas production from 1989 and several are now depleted and have been decommissioned.


The fields[edit]
Mobil instigated the field naming convention using characters, people, places and objects associated with the legendary British King Arthur. Mobil applied it to its gas fields across the southern North Sea. The Arthurian fields span Quadrants 48, 49 and 53 from Arthur in the south east to Excalibur in the north west.[1]
The Arthurian fields and the reservoir parameters are as follows.[1] [2] [3] [4]

Calhoun, originally called Sutter, is an unincorporated community in Le Flore County in the State of Oklahoma,[1] approximately 7 miles northwest of Poteau, the county seat.[2][3]  Located about 6.5 driving miles west-southwest of Shady Point, Oklahoma, Calhoun can be reached off of US Route 59 at Shady Point by heading west on County Road D1310, then County Road 90.[4]  The town is just northwest of Cavanal Hill, which makes the eccentric boast of being the “world’s highest hill.”[3][5]
For a while a coal mining boomtown, Calhoun later waned along with the industry.[6]

History[edit]
The settlement began existence under the name of Sutter.[6]  When the nearby town of Shady Point got a railroad connection during 1895-1896 courtesy of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad, later the Kansas City Southern Railway (“KCS”), Sutter coal began to flow through Shady Point primarily for the railroad's own use.[6][7]  Transportation between the two points was improved in the 1900-1901 timeframe when the Choctaw Coal & Mining Company incorporated its own railway, the Poteau Valley Railroad (“PVR”), on October 19, 1900,[8] which built a 6.6 mile line from a connection with the KCS at Shady Point directly to the mines at Sutter.[4][9][10]
Sequoyah Coal Mining Company succeeded to the ownership of the PVR by 1905.[9]  In 1910, Sequoyah Coal Mining was shipping six to ten carloads of coal out of Sutter each day.[11]  The town had three substantial mercantile firms, a cotton gin, a grist mill, a Baptist church, and a public school.[11]
The KCS took over the PVR on March 2, 1912, but the line continued to operate separately.[9]  In 1914, the town changed names and became Calhoun.[6]
By 1921, KCS was losing money on providing passenger trains to Calhoun, and attempted to reduce the two passenger trains which ran in each direction every day except Sunday down to one.[7]  Such trains were timed to make a connection with the KCS train to or from Poteau.[7]  But the attempt was blocked by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, and passenger service to the town continued as before.[7]  At that time, the town had about 1500 residents, 300 of whom were directly employed as miners.[7]  Calhoun had eleven various retail stores, with the largest mercantile in town owned by mining company Central Coal & Lumber.[7] The town had no hospital, the nearest being in Fort Smith, Arkansas.[7]  About 90% of banking transactions by residents were done in Poteau.[7]
As the coal industry waned, so did the town.[6]  Rail service to Calhoun was finally abandoned altogether in 1926.[6][8]  By the time of the Thirty-sixth annual report of the Department of Mines and Minerals in 1943, no production at all was shown from Calhoun in Le Flore County.[12]

Promicroceras is an extinct ammonite genus from the upper Sinemurian (Lower Jurassic)[1] of Europe, named by Leonard Spath in 1925. Promicroceras is included in the family Eoderoceratidae, which is part of the ammonitid superfamily Eoderoceratoidea.
Shells are evolute with an open umbilicus; strongly ribbed, ribs flattened on the venter, and with small spines without distinct tubercles.

Distribution[edit]
Promicroceras species are commonly found in South West England, particularly along the Dorset coast.[2]
Pyritic Promicroceras fossils are commonly found along the coast of Lyme Regis and Charmouth where they are well preserved in the Lower Jurassic (Sinemurian) Black Ven Marl. Fossil shops in the area commonly sell cleaned and polished Promicroceras.

Portland Children's MuseumEstablished1946Dissolved2021TypeChildren's museumFounderDorothea Lensch
Portland Children's Museum was a children's museum located in Portland's Washington Park, adjacent to the Oregon Zoo. Founded in 1946, Portland Children's Museum was the sixth oldest children's museum in the world and the oldest west of the Mississippi.[citation needed] The 50,000 sq ft (4,600 m2) museum received over a quarter of a million visits from children and their families every year. It was a non-profit organization with tax-exempt status and member of the Association of Children's Museums. In March 2021, the museum announced it would permanently close at the end of June, due to the financial loss brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.[1]

History[edit]
Portland Children's Museum was founded in 1946 as the Adventure House by recreation director of Portland Parks & Recreation, Dorothea Lensch.[2][3] Dr. Lensch was the first woman appointed Recreation Director for the division.
The original museum building was located at the Jacob Kamm mansion in Southwest Portland until 1949 when it moved to a building (formerly a dormitory) on Lair Hill just south of downtown Portland. The Lair Hill Museum contained a pet library (from which children could check-out animals) as well as a variety of interactive and informative exhibits. The Lair Hill museum hosted regular arts and crafts workshops as well as sports games and other activities.
After 52 years of occupancy at the downtown location, the building was closed on March 31, 2001, and Portland Children's Museum moved to its final location in Washington Park, in the building which previously housed Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.

Inside the museum
The mission of Portland Children's Museum was to create transformative learning experiences through the arts and sciences. The museum used cognitive science and child development research to inform environments and programs that promoted healthy cognitive, social, emotional and physical development. Myriad exhibits, including Water Works, Play-it-Again Theater, Building Bridgetown, Groundworks, Outdoor Adventure, and the Baby's Garden, along with the museum's art studios, The Clay Studio, The Wonder Corner and The Garage encouraged playful inquiry, cultivated creative expression and helped children learn how to learn.
Portland Children's Museum provided access to the museum and museum programs for children and families with economic, social or physical challenges through the Community Partners Program. Qualifying children, families, schools and other groups had access to low-cost Museum memberships and family passes, free or subsidized arts workshops, and other resources. The museum also hosted a number of admission-free days and evenings. As of 2009, the Community Partners Program provided access to the museum and museum programs for over 20,000 children and their families.
Opal School of the Portland Children's Museum was an elementary school that was chartered by the Portland Public School District. Opal's teaching and learning approaches were influenced and inspired by the philosophies and practices of the Reggio Emilia approach.
Portland Children's Museum was supported through member contributions, sponsorships, foundation grants, federal grants, and the support of generous individuals. While the museum had a full-time staff, it depended on volunteers at every level of the organization.

Humphrey BradleyDiedbefore 1639NationalityEnglishOther namesHumfroy BradleyOccupationland drainage engineerTitleMaître des digues du royaumeSpouseAnna Sermantens
Humphrey Bradley was an English land drainage engineer, active from about 1584 to 1625. He may have been the son of John Bradley of Bergen op Zoom in Brabant, then in the Dutch Republic, and Anna van der Delft.[1]
Between 1584 and 1594 he was in England, where he worked on drainage projects on the Great Ouse, the Nene and the Witham rivers, prepared an analysis of the costs of improving the harbour at Dover, and submitted a proposal for draining the whole of the Fens.[1] His manuscript Discourse of Humphry Bradley, a Brabanter, concerning the fens in Norfolk, Huntingdon, Cambridge, Northampton, and Lincolnshire is written in Italian and is dated 3 December 1589.[2][3]: 18  Also in 1589, he married Anna Sermantens of Delft; their children Joachim and Sara were baptised at the Dutch Church in Austin Friars, in the City of London.[1]
By 1596 he was in France, sent by the States-General of the Dutch Republic to assist Henri IV with land drainage for military purposes. On 1 January 1599 he was appointed maître des digues du royaume, or "master of dykes of the Kingdom", which essentially gave him a monopoly of all dyking and land reclamation work throughout the country.[1][4]: 100  Early in the seventeenth century he contracted to drain parts of the Marais de Saintonge, but was not able to carry the work forward until after 1607, when the Société générale de desséchement des marais et lacs de France was formed by royal edict. Workers were brought from the Low Countries, and by about 1610 the area between Muron and Tonnay-Charente had come to be known as the Marais de la Petite-Flandre, the "marsh of little Flanders".[5]: 81 
Bradley enjoyed the support of Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, the chief minister of Henri IV, and carried out substantial land reclamation work in Auvergne – the Marais de Sarliève in the Limagne – and in the Languedoc.[1][4]: 103  A proposal for a canal from Dijon to Joigny, which would have connected the Saône to the Seine, and thus linked Marseille to Rouen, was not accepted.[1]
The last documented mention of Bradley is from 1625; he is thought to have died before 1639.[1]

Ako Bicol Political Party (AKB) is a political party in the Philippines participating in the party-list elections in the Philippines. It represents the Bicol Region and the Bicolano people. In the 2016 elections, AKB was the top partylist with 1,664,975 votes, earning it 3 seats in Congress.[1]


Background[edit]
AKB is a movement composed of individuals who are either residents of the Bicol Region, born of Bicolano parents, have resided in Bicol or simply interested in the promotion of the welfare and interests of the region and its people, collectively known as “Bicolanos,” with the aim to unite Bicolanos to work in the development of the Bicol Region through programs and projects that will combat poverty, provide adequate social services, promote full employment, guarantee social justice and full respect for human rights, recognize the sanctity of human life, improve delivery of health services, democratize access to education and training, protect the environment, enhance disaster preparedness and advance the participation of youth, women, gays and lesbians and physically challenged individuals as well senior citizens in nation building.[2]
AKB also endeavors to instill confidence and foster patriotism among Bicolanos through the promotion of Bicol history, arts and culture, appreciation of the role of Bicolano heroes, national figures and other role models in the historical and cultural development of the region and strengthening the inherent resiliency of Bicolanos amidst adversities but at the same time, minimizing and if not totally eradicating, perceived attitudes and values which tend to hamper progress and development.[2]

History[edit]
Before 2010[edit]
AKB started as a non-government organization under the name "SOS Bicol," which provided rescue aid to residents in the Bicol region after Typhoon Reming (Durian) hit; it also sponsored livelihood programs for residents affected by the 2009 eruption of the Mayon Volcano.[3]

2010 elections[edit]
In a May 2010 Social Weather Stations opinion poll, AKB topped the survey, with 5.64% of the vote, the equivalent of two seats, beating seasoned party-list election contenders Buhay Hayaan Yumabong and Bayan Muna. However, AKB has been accused by the Kontra Daya (Against Cheating) group of being a creation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to expand her base of allies in the House of Representatives, a charge that AKB denied.[4][5]
AKB emerged as the surprising topnotcher in the 2010 election, one of only two parties (the other being 1st Consumers Alliance for Rural Energy) above the threshold not to have previously sat in Congress.[3] However, in a Bicol Mail column by Luis Ruben General, AKB would duplicate the work of the district representatives, implying that the "Bicolanos are now marginalized and distinctly disadvantaged."[3] However, a disqualification case was filed against the party, claiming that the party had violated the party-list system law since the party was backed by the Co family, which owns construction companies, malls and resorts in Bicol, and therefore "cannot represent the marginalized and underrepresented sector," according to the disqualification petition.[6]
On May 31, 2010, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) declared several groups to have won seats under the party-list system, but the proclamations of AKB's seats (and those of several other parties) were deferred due to the pending disqualification cases against them.[7] On July 28, it was announced that the COMELEC had dismissed all petitions against AKB, saying that party-list system law allows for regional political parties that do not represent a particular sector of society.[8] The original petition was dismissed on June 29, but the original petitioners did not file a motion for reconsideration until July 26, after deadline for filing motions has lapsed. This allows the commission to proclaim Ako Bicol's three nominees as congressmen.[9]

2013 elections[edit]
On October 10, 2012, COMELEC announced that AKB (along with 12 other parties) was disqualified from running in the 2013 party-list election by a unanimous 6–0 vote of commission members.[5][10] The commission cited the party's failure to represent a specific sector of society, a requirement for parties fielding candidates under the sectoral representation (party list) system.[11] AKB Representative Alfredo Garbin Jr. expressed surprise at the decision.[5] On November 13, 2012, the Supreme Court granted a petition filed by AKB to forestall COMELEC acting on its decision.[12][13]

2016 elections[edit]
In the 2016 elections, Ako Bicol won 1,664,975 votes (5.14% of the national vote), the highest votes for any party in the election, while winning three seats in total, making it the party's most successful election.

Death of Congressman Rodel M. Batocabe[edit]
In 2018,[14]Rodel Batocabe announced that he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives. Instead, Batocabe announced his candidacy for Mayor of Daraga in Albay province in the forthcoming May 2019 general elections. He would have challenged Daraga Mayor Carlwyn Baldo, who was also seeking re-election in 2019.
On December 22, 2018, Batocabe was attending a gift giving event for senior citizens in the small village of Burgos in Daraga, Albay. Two men approached Batocabe, who was 52 years-old, at the event and shot him eight times. His police escort, Officer Orlando Diaz, was also killed, while seven elderly attendees were also wounded in the attack. Batocabe and Diaz were taken to a hospital in Legazpi City, where both were pronounced dead. By coincidence, December 22 also marked Batocabe's wedding anniversary to his wife, Gertie.
On January 3, 2019, it was announced that Daraga Mayor Carlwyn Baldo had ordered the killing of Rep. Batocabe. At the time of his murder, Batocabe was running for Mayor of Daraga, while Baldo was seeking re-election. According to the police, Baldo hired six men to kill Batocabe and set up $95,000 in funds to pay for the murder. The plot had allegedly been in the works since August 2018, when Baldo supplied $4,600 to one of the hitmen to purchase guns and motorcycles. Mayor Carlwyn Baldo denied the allegations in a statement read over the phone to local radio stations, calling himself " a convenient scapegoat."
Atty. Ronald S. Ang took his oath on January 15, 2019, to replace slain lawmaker Rodel Batocabe as the representative of the party.[15] Ang took his oath before Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and joined Christopher Co and Alfredo Garbin Jr. as representatives of the party-list in the 17th Congress.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon is an action-adventure video game based on the 2011 film of the same name. It is the sequel to 2009's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and the third video game adaptation of the live-action Transformers film series. Unlike the first two games, Dark of the Moon follows an original story, set before the events of the film it is based on, and features only one campaign, which alternates between the Autobots and the Decepticons. A spin-off, Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark, was released in June 2014.
There are three different versions of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, developed by High Moon Studios; one for the Wii and Nintendo 3DS, titled Transformers: Dark of the Moon Stealth Force Edition; and one for the DS, developed by Behaviour Interactive. The gameplay in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions is similar to High Moon Studios' previous title, Transformers: War for Cybertron.[3] All versions of the game were published by Activision in June 2011, and received mixed reviews. Electronic Arts published mobile versions of the game for Symbian, iOS and BlackBerry.


Gameplay[edit]
See also: Gameplay in Transformers: War for Cybertron
The game, like its predecessors, is mostly a third-person shooter and has players fight various types of AI enemies in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Unlike its predecessors, Dark of the Moon features a single linear campaign rather than one for each faction, with players changing between the Autobots' and the Decepticons' perspective between levels.
Most notably, the game introduces a new feature called "Stealth Force", which allows the characters to use weapons while in vehicle form. In both vehicle and robot form, characters have access to two special abilities, which change when the player transforms. For example, Ironhide may have the ability to throw grenades in robot form, and a speed-up ability in vehicle form. The multiplayer component of the game features four classes: Scout, Hunter, Commander and Warrior, which all have specific traits, such as the Scout being faster than the other classes, or the Warrior having more health.[4]

Synopsis[edit]
Setting[edit]
Dark of the Moon takes place roughly three years after the events of Revenge of the Fallen. Earth continues to be consumed by the deadly war between the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the evil Decepticons, led by Megatron. The former co-operate with mankind to investigate and prevent Decepticons' activities around the world, while the latter make preparations for the upcoming "Operation: Pillar", which will allow them to finally defeat their rivals and restore their home planet of Cybertron to its former glory, destroying all life on Earth in the process.

Plot[edit]
Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3[edit]
The Autobot scout Bumblebee is sent somewhere in South America to plant Wheeljack's virus to a Decepticon transmitter that is listening to the Autobots' transmissions with NEST. Though he encounters heavy resistance from Decepticon forces, he ultimately prevails with the help of Optimus Prime and Sideswipe. Afterwards, the Autobots attempt to defend the city of Detroit from Decepticon forces led by the Constructicon Mixmaster. The Autobot weapon specialist Ironhide and medical officer Ratchet lead the defensive, with the former ultimately prevailing with the help of an experimental rocket launcher provided by Wheeljack, killing Mixmaster after a lengthy battle and chasing away the remaining Decepticons.
Meanwhile, somewhere in South America, Sideswipe disappears during his mission to investigate Decepticon activity in a jungle, and Mirage is sent to investigate alongside Bumblebee. On the way to meet with him, Mirage encounters the vicious Decepticon second-in-command Starscream, who attacks him as he was about to cross a bridge, destroying it and injuring Mirage. Unable to transform or use his weapons, Mirage opts to sneak past the Decepticon troops instead, using his camouflage ability to make his way to a crashed NEST helicopter unobserved and get a supply drop containing weaponry. He then fights his way past the remaining Decepticons alongside Bumblebee, ultimately finding and rescuing Sideswipe, who reveals that the ruins he was investigating were built over an ancient Cybertronian space port; the Decepticons had already commenced the countdown for the launch of a docked spacecraft and, despite the Autobots' best efforts, it manages to take off.
Elsewhere, the Decepticon Soundwave is ordered by Megatron to investigate a former Sector 7 base on an island. Aided by his minon Laserbeak, Soundwave fights his way through the Autobot troops guarding the base and retrieves information about a crash on the moon in the 1960s, as well as some advanced technology called MechTech, which he destroys by triggering a volcanic eruption, before escaping the base. At the same time, Starscream is sent to Nepal to find and destroy the remaining MechTech that is about to be airlifted by the massive Aerialbot Stratosphere from a NEST facility somewhere in the snowy mountain range. Upon killing the other Aerialbots - Air Raid, Breakaway and Silverbolt - he destroys Stratosphere mid-air, along with all the technology he is carrying, though he manages to retrieve a weapon and returns with it to the Decepticon base in Siberia, unaware that it had a tracker on it.
The Autobots subsequently invade the base, but Megatron fights them off, killing Warpath in the process. He then finds a cryotube holding a frozen Shockwave, the infamous Decepticon scientist and assassin, whom he frees from his imprisonment, before facing Optimus Prime. Megatron prevails and throws the beaten Optimus into the pit holding Shockwave and the Driller - a giant worm-beast like robot controlled directly by Shockwave. As Megatron makes his escape, Optimus fights Shockwave and his Driller and defeats them, though they flee afterwards. He is then contacted by Ratchet, whom he tells that, though the battle is won for now, the war is far from over. Meanwhile, Megatron meets with Starscream, Soundwave, and Shockwave somewhere in Africa to launch "Operation: Pillar," assuring his fellow Decepticons that Cybertron shall be reborn soon.

Wii and Nintendo 3DS[edit]
As the Autobots continue their hunt for the Decepticons despite humanity believing that they have fled the planet, Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Mirage head to a desert to test the new "Stealth Force Mode" upgrade provided by the Autobot scientist Wheeljack. Once they're done, Optimus tries to contact NEST, only to find their communication link was jammed, so he sends Bumblebee to investigate a Decepticon base nearby and learn why. Discovering that the Decepticons are using satellite dishes to jam their communications, Bumblebee shuts them down, but loses connection with the others upon venturing into the base. Optimus goes after him and, at Wheeljack's suggestion, uploads a virus into three satellites, allowing the Autobots to learn the Decepticons' motive. As Optimus is fighting waves of incoming Decepticons, Bumblebee escapes, and the pair then flee from the base. Upon being picked up by Stratosphere, the Autobots analyze the information they retrieved from the base, and learn that the Decepticons plan to attack Detroit, Michigan, in addition to plotting something code-named "Operation: Pillar", as well as that Megatron is looking for someone known as "Shockwave".
In Detroit, the Decepticons Soundwave and Mixmaster lead a full-scale assault on the city, with the former deploying Lockdown to infiltrate the Autobots' base. While Lockdown uploads a virus created by Mixmaster into the mainframe terminals, Ironhide, the only Autobot in the area, protects some satellite dishes from the Decepticons troops. Learning that Mixmaster is trying to bring his former teammates back online and to reform Devastator, Ironhinde confronts and kills Mixmaster, before fighting Soundwave, who is aided by Starscream. After defeating Soundwave, who retreats, Ironhide is called by Optimus back to the headquarters, just as Lockdown is ordered by Starscream to destroy the controls for the main gate and escape, all the while avoiding Optimus.
After tracking the Decepticons to an abandoned base in Siberia, an Autobot team led by Optimus assaults the base, during which Wheeljack informs Optimus that Megatron is trying to reactivate his primary objective: Shockwave - a deadly Decepticon scientist and assassin. After Mirage takes out the Decepticon's communications and Ironhide destroys the shield protecting the entrance,[5] Megatron orders Soundwave to fight off the Autobots while he reactivates Shockwave. As Soundwave defeats Mirage, who was aided by Stratosphere and flees afterwards, Megatron destroys the coils inside the base to speed up Shockwave's reanimation. Upon awakening, Shockwave tells Megatron that his Energon levels are depleted, so Megatron orders Soundwave to escort him to safety while he fights off the incoming Autobots. Megatron is soon informed that the Driller - a giant worm-beast like robot controlled directly by Shockwave - has been awakened as well, and decides to use it to destroy Optimus, while ordering Starscream and the other Decepticons to leave Siberia.
Megatron defeats Optimus and attempts to escape from the base as well, but is confronted by Ironhide. Against Wheeljack's warnings, Ironhide fights Megatron and defeats him, much to his surprise, as Megaron remarks that he has "a warrior's spirit" and that he will destroy him during their next encounter. Megatron then escapes, as does Ironhide, at Wheeljack's advice, who promises that they'll get Megatron next time. Later, Megatron meets with Starscream, Soundwave, and Shockwave somewhere in South Africa, where he prepares to launch "Operation: Pillar" and orders Shockwave to retrieve a certain ancient Cybertronian artifact from Chernobyl, leading into the events of the film.

High Moon Studios, who previously developed Transformers: War for Cybertron, developed the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game,[3]  while Behaviour Interactive developed the Wii and Nintendo 3DS versions. The first trailer for the game was released on February 12, 2011.[5]

Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions[edit]
The title has received mixed reviews, with a score of 59 and 57 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions on Metacritic. GameZone gave the 360 and PS3 version a 7, stating "Transformers: Dark of the Moon is a perfectly fine, if short, adaptation of the Transformers film. The characters are likable, and the different vehicle types work beautifully." IGN gave the Xbox 360 and PS3 version a 6.0 of 10. Praising the ideas but criticizing the game as a whole. GameSpot gave 5.5 of 10. They praised the transformation abilities but criticized the bad graphics, strange vehicle physics and brief campaign.[citation needed]
Joystiq gave the title a bad rating of 2 out of 5 stars, criticizing the game because it feels half-finished. Destructoid gave the title a 5.5 out of 10 rating, stating that the title is better than most movie video games, but feels like a rushed movie tie-in. The Official Xbox Magazine awarded the title a 6.5 out of 10 rating, praising the controls, stealth force mode but criticized the last levels of the game and the multiplayer component. GamePro gave the title a 3.5 out of 5 star rating. They praised the good graphics, voice acting and variety of transformers for each mission but criticized the story, vehicle physics, multiplayer mode and the repetitive melee combat. GameTrailers gave the title a 7 out of 10 rating, stating that "Dark of the Moon provides plenty of popcorn thrills that you'll likely forget as soon as the credits begin rolling. Judged against other movie games, it's actually pretty good; next to last year's superior entry, however, it looks a bit like a tin can." Game Informer gave the title a 7.5 out of 10 rating, Stating that anybody who played Transformers: War for Cybertron should enjoy this title. Eurogamer gave the title a low rating of 5 out of 10, stating that the title doesn't have enough polish as War for Cybertron had received and High Moon Studios should've been given more time.[citation needed]

Wii and Nintendo 3DS versions[edit]
Wii and Nintendo 3DS versions of the game received negative reviews, scoring 34 and 30 on Metacritic.[21][22]

Scuticociliatosis is a severe and often fatal parasitic infection of several groups of marine organisms. Species known to be susceptible include a broad range of teleosts, seahorses, sharks, and some crustaceans. The disease can be caused by any one of about 20 distinct species of unicellular eukaryotes known as scuticociliates, which are free-living marine microorganisms that are opportunistic or facultative parasites. Scuticociliatosis has been described in the wild, in captive animals in aquariums, and in aquaculture. It is best studied in fish species that are commonly farmed, in which typical effects of infection include skin ulceration, hemorrhage, and necrosis, with post-mortem examination identifying ciliates in the skin, gills, blood, and internal organs including the brain.[1][2]


Host range[edit]
Scuticociliatosis has been reported in a broad range of teleosts; it is best studied in those teleost fish commonly raised in aquaculture, where the disease is of significant economic impact. It has also been reported in seahorses, sharks, and crustaceans. The mortality rate is particularly high among flatfish, possibly due to their sedentary lifestyle involving skin-to-skin contact between individuals.[1]

Disease mechanism[edit]
Scuticociliatosis consists of overwhelming infection of an animal's body by any one of around 20 species of scuticociliate. These unicellular organisms are free-living in marine environments but are opportunistic parasites with a diverse host range. It is unclear what triggers infection, although infection rates are known to be higher, in both experimental and aquaculture conditions, in warmer water.[1] Low salinity has also been reported to reduce disease rates.[3] Under some conditions, ciliates have been reported to successfully infect healthy fish, likely through the gills;[2] other reports suggest abrasions or skin damage may be required.[4] Scuticociliates are histophagous (tissue-eating) and extensively degrade body tissues. Histological postmortem examination of affected fish usually reveals ciliates in the skin and gills, blood, and internal organs, with significant damage to the brain and nervous system, which is likely responsible for behaviors such as abnormal swimming in infected individuals.[1]

Causative agents[edit]
The exact species of scuticociliate responsible for a given outbreak is often not identified. As a result, differences in virulence and disease course among different scuticociliates are not well characterized. In one study, infection by Miamiensis avidus was reported to have a higher mortality rate than Pseudocohnilembus persalinus, Pseudocohnilembus hargisi and Uronema marinum.[5] Infections by U. marinum show a less severe disease course, possibly restricted to the skin surface; it has been suggested that this ciliate may be only a secondary pathogen.[1] M. avidus, P. persalinus, U. marinum, and U. nigricans have all been reported in aquaculture settings.[3]

Outbreaks[edit]
Scuticociliatosis outbreaks are recurring problems in fisheries, especially of olive flounder. Outbreaks in both aquaculture and natural settings are more common in the spring and summer, when water temperature is higher.[1] Outbreaks have also been identified in captive settings; in one aquarium an outbreak of M. avidus was responsible for the deaths of six sharks.[6]
Scuticociliatosis due to Miamiensis avidus infection is believed to be responsible for a 2017 die-off of fish and leopard sharks found in the San Francisco Bay.[7]

Treatment and prevention[edit]
There is no treatment for scuticociliatosis once parasites have infected an animal's internal organs. In aquaculture settings, chemical treatment of the water to kill ciliates can be used in conjunction with antibiotics.[1]

Sassa Narimasa (佐々 成政, February 6, 1536 – July 7, 1588) was a Japanese samurai lord of the Sengoku through Azuchi–Momoyama periods.[1] He entered Oda Nobunaga's service at the age of 14 and remained in his service throughout Nobunaga's rise to power. He was a member of the so-called Echizen Sanninshu (Echizen Triumvir) along with Maeda Toshiie and Fuwa Mitsuharu. He was also known as Kura-no-suke (内蔵助).


Early life[edit]
Sassa Narimasa's Tonsure Monument
Sassa Narimasa was born to Sassa Morimasa in what is now Nishi-ku, Nagoya (situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province). He became a retainer of Oda Nobunaga in 1550.[1] Narimasa was a military commander under Nobunaga, and the leader of Oda's Kurohoro-shū (黒母衣衆, lit. 'Black Mantle group'), a Military group with a black Horo (cloak) on their backs.[2][3]
In 1560, after his brothers were killed in battle, Narimasa took over the family estate and became the lord of the Hirajo Castle.

Military life[edit]
Picture of Sassa Narimasa by Utagawa Yoshiiku 1867
Narimasa served Nobunaga throughout the latter's career. He was noted for his ability to lead matchlock forces, a position he regularly held.
In 1567, he fought in the Siege of Inabayama Castle against Saito Tatsuoki from the Saitō clan.
In 1570, Narimasa participated in the Siege of Kanegasaki, leading a few armed forces of horse guards, and worked to support Hashiba Hideyoshi using a firearms troop.
Later, he fought the Azai and Asakura clans in the  Battle of Anegawa, where he was in the rear guard.
In 1575, Narimasa fought at the Battle of Nagashino against Takeda Katsuyori from Takeda clan. Later, he was given Komaru Castle in Echizen, where he had recently helped put down rioting Ikkō-ikki, and became a member of Echizen Sanninshu (Echizen Triumvir).
In 1577, he participated in the Battle of Tedorigawa against Uesugi Kenshin from the Uesugi clan.
In 1580, he was involved in stabilizing the Etchu Province, against an uprising of Ikko sect followers who supported Jimbo Nagazumi.
In 1581, he defended Toyama Castle against Kawada Nagayori in the Battle of Arakawa.
In 1582, he and Shibata Katsuie successfully laid siege to Uozu against Uesugi Kagekatsu from the Uesugi clan.[4] He was granted Etchū Province as a reward for helping Shibata Katsuie fight the Uesugi clan. 
In 1582, after Oda Nobunaga's death at Honnō-ji, at the Kiyosu meeting, Narimasa took the side of Shibata, but he could not participate in the battle of Shizugatake in 1583, since he could not leave Etchu where he was preparing for the attack of the Uesugi army at Matsukura Castle (Toyama Prefecture). After the death of Katsuie, Narimasa joined Tokugawa Ieyasu.
In 1584, during the battle of Komaki Nagakute, he and the Tokugawa alliance unsuccessfully challenged the Toyotomi force under Maeda Toshiie at the Siege of Suemori.
In 1585, he was defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi at Siege of Toyama, and later Narimasa submitted to Hideyoshi and his life was spared.
In 1587, after the Hideyoshi Kyushu Campaign, he was given a fief in Higo Province in Kyushu.[5]

Death[edit]
In 1588, however, due to difficulties in suppressing a Higo Province local revolt, he committed suicide (seppuku) by Hideyoshi's instruction.[1] The insurrection stemmed from survey of his province, which resulted in a change in the distance in which farmers transported their tax rice from 3 ri to 8 ri.[6]
Later, after Higo Province was confiscated from Sassa Narimasa, land in Higo (roughly half of the province) and Kumamoto Castle granted to Kato Kiyomasa.

J-Air Co., Ltd. (株式会社ジェイエア, Kabushiki-gaisha Jei Ea), is a regional commuter airline with its headquarters in the Terminal Building in Itami Airport near Toyonaka, Osaka Prefecture, Japan[1] and its main hub at Itami Airport. J-Air previously had its headquarters in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture.[2] Its operations include scheduled passenger services to 17 destinations across regional Japan, under Japan Airlines flight numbers. The airline has a fleet of 35 aircraft, consisting of Embraer 170s and Embraer 190s linking tier-two and tier-three cities in Japan as to bypass JAL's congested hub in Tokyo (both Narita and Haneda).
J-Air is a wholly owned subsidiary of Japan's flag carrier, Japan Airlines (JAL) and an affiliate member of the Oneworld alliance. The airline was founded on 8 August 1996, when JAL restructured JAL Flight Academy and J-Air was separated; and began operations as a separate entity from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport on 1 November. Faced with limited opportunities for route expansion at Hiroshima, the airline relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield, after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport, on 17 February 2005. In the fiscal year ended 31 March 1999, J-Air, together with its sister airlines within the JAL Group, carried over 32 million passengers and over 1.1 million tons of cargo and mail.[citation needed]


History[edit]
JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was established by Japan Airlines (JAL) in April 1991, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided conversion training for its flight engineers to become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled Nishi Seto Airlink services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan. Since the introduction of the 19-seats Jetstream 31s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante inherited from Nishi Seto.[3][4][5]
In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was separated and established as a wholly owned regional subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines on 8 August. On 1 November, the airline inaugurated its first flight from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the local government subsidy was terminated at the end of the 2000 fiscal year and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic marketing strategy, JAL found a niche market where the 100-plus-seats Boeing 737s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats Bombardier CRJ-200s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.[3][4][6]
Despite the introduction of the Bombardier CRJ-200s, there were limited opportunities for route expansion from its home at Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline decided to move to Nagoya Airfield, after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On 17 February 2005, J-Air realized its dream and relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield. In order to strengthen the recognition of the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from 1 April 2005.[4][7]
On 1 April 2007, J-Air, together with four of its sister airlines within the JAL Group, joined Oneworld and became a Oneworld affiliate member.[8] On 18 June, JAL signed a purchase agreement with Embraer for ten Embraer 170 jets, with options to acquire another five aircraft. The contract value was worth approximately US$435 million, if all the options are exercised. The aircraft will be used for linking tier-two and tier-three cities in Japan as to bypass the airline’s congested hub in Tokyo. The aircraft was configured to seat 76 passengers in a single-class layout and was designated for J-Air.[9][10] The first aircraft was delivered on 3 October 2008, received the type certification from the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) on 27 October and operated its first flight in February 2009.[11][12][13]
J-Air has been reported by Japanese newspapers and television to be leaving Nagoya Airfield in a phased transition with many flights leaving October 2010 and all flights leaving by end of March 2011.

Historical liveries[edit]

J-Air had many liveries over the years. In the following order:

1991 to 2002: J-AIR livery[edit]
A fusion of the J-AIR letters with a red square separating the 'J' and the 'AIR' titles, and a grey band feature on the fuselage.

2002 to 2011: Arc of the Sun livery[edit]
After Japan Airlines (JAL) and Japan Air System (JAS) merged, the Tokyo office of Landor and JAL worked together again to create a new brand identity. Landor devised a livery referred to as the "Arc of the Sun". The 2000s rebranding began in April 2002 and was completed in April 2004. The brand identity firm designed 300,000 specific items for JAL. The JAL acronym remained, but it was changed to include a curved bar, which replaced the simple red square and gray rectangle used from 1989 (1991 For J-AIR). The curved bar was likened to a samurai sword. The tail now featured a quarter sun outlined in silver. JAL changed its branding again on 1 April 2011, reverting to the original 1959 brand, with slight modifications, as part of their post-bankruptcy rebrand.

2011-Present: Tsurumaru J-Air livery[edit]
The J-Air livery is called the tsurumaru (鶴丸) or "crane circle." It is an image of a Japanese red-crown crane with its wings extended in full flight. The Tsurumaru logo of its parent (Japan Airlines)  was created in 1958 by Jerry Huff, the creative director at Botsford, Constantine and Gardner of San Francisco, which had been the advertising agency for Japan Airlines from its earliest days.

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J-Air&oldid=1214677024"In this Chinese name, the family name is  Ye.
Ye Zhichao (Chinese: 葉志超; Wade–Giles: Yeh Chih-ch'ao; 1838-1901) was a Chinese general of the Qing Dynasty who fought in the First Sino-Japanese War, being the commander of Qing forces stationed in Korea. 
An aging veteran of the Nian Rebellion[1], he sided in November 1891 with Chinese secret society called Jindandao (金丹道), who rose in revolt in Inner Mongolia and massacred 150,000 - 500,000 Mongols.[citation needed] When Li Hongzhang, Governor-General of Chinese Zhili Province, dispatched Ye Zhichao, Commander-in-chief of Zhili, to suppress the rebels, he falsely reporting to the imperial court in Beijing that the Mongol banner army killed innocent Chinese. Prince Vangdudnamjil, the jasagh of the Kharachin Right Banner, who was consulted with by the imperial court, successfully rebutted General Ye's claim with a detailed report[2]
As commander of the Zhili provincial troops under Li Hongzhang when the Sino-Japanese war broke out in 1894,[3] General Ye initially led the 3,000 Chinese army at Asan, but when they were driven out of the city by the Imperial Japanese Army and he retreated north to Pyongyang. Following the defeat at Pyongyang by the Japanese in September 1894, Ye Zhichao ordered the Chinese defenders to retreat over the Yalu River (which marked the border between China and Korea) into Qing territory.[4] General Ye was sentenced to death for his failures, but managed to avoid being executed due to his guanxi connections.[5] He was also reputed to be an opium addict.[6]

John Leigh (1689–1726) was an Irish actor and dramatist.[1]

Stage career[edit]
Leigh appeared as Demetrius in Thomas Shadwell's adaptation of Timon of Athens, produced at Dublin's Smock Alley Theatre in 1714. Recruited by John Rich for London's newly erected theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields, he played there on the opening night, 18 December 1714, as Captain Plume in The Recruiting Officer by George Farquhar.[2] Leigh remained at Lincoln's Inn until his death,[3] and played some original parts.[4] The last part to which Leigh's name appears is Phorbas in Œdipus, 14 April 1726.[1]
On 26 November 1719 Leigh acted Lord George Belmour in his own comedy The Pretenders (published 1720), original title Kensington Garden, or the Pretenders. This was acted about seven times, and is dedicated to Lord Brooke, an original supporter of the theatre. On 11 January 1720 a new farce by Leigh in two acts, Hob's Wedding, (published 1720), was acted for the first time. It was repeated six times, the author having benefits on the third and fifth nights. Leigh's share in this was minor, the piece consisting only of the scenes of the Country Wake, which Thomas Doggett cut when he converted it into Flora, or Hob in the Well, It was, according to John Genest, printed, with songs added by John Hippisley, in 1732 as the Sequel to Flora, and was revived in the same year. William Rufus Chetwood gave in his short life of Leigh a ballad written by him to the tune of Thomas, I cannot, a humorous song about other actors.[1]
Leigh died in 1726. Nicknamed Handsome Leigh, he was initially popular, but did not sustain his position. After Lacy Ryan and Thomas Walker joined the company, he fell into the background.[1]

^ Francis Leigh, son of Anthony Leigh, was until 1719 a member of the same company, playing similar characters, causing issues of correct identification. On 16 February 1715 John Leigh was the original Octavio in the Perplexed Couple, or Mistake upon Mistake, an adaptation from Le Cocu Imaginaire of Molière, attributed to Charles Molloy. Carlos in Colley Cibber's Love Makes a Man followed, and 23 June he was the original Lord Gaylove in the Doating Lovers of Newburgh Hamilton. Freeman in The Plain Dealer, Heartfree in The Provoked Wife, Galliard in the Feigned Courtezans, Florez in The Royal Merchant, and Sir Humphry Scattergood in The Woman Captain (Thomas Shadwell) were assigned him the following season, and he was the first Beaufort in The Perfidious Brother (Lewis Theobald's authorship was disputed by Henry Mestayer). On 26 September 1718 Leigh played Don Sebastian in John Dryden's play of that name. He subsequently appeared as Moneses in Tamerlane, Duke in The Traytor altered from James Shirley by Christopher Bullock, Juba in Cato, Mellefont in The Double Dealer, Macduff, Antony in Julius Caesar, and 7 February 1719 as Bellair, sen., in The Younger Brother, or the Sham Marquis (anonymous). In a revival of Richard II Leigh played Bolingbroke, and 7 January 1720 he was Cymbeline in the Injured Princess, or the Fatal Wager, Thomas D'Urfey's adaptation of Shakespeare's play.

Breakfast Television (often abbreviated as BT) is a Canadian morning television program that is broadcast on Citytv. As of 2023, BT only broadcast from Toronto as a four-hour morning show, while a national edition aired in 8:30-10 a.m. local time on all Citytv stations (outside of Citytv Saskatchewan). Versions were formerly broadcast in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Montreal, but have been canceled and replaced with alternative programming. The version broadcast by the Atlantic Satellite Network (which was owned by Citytv's former parent CHUM Limited, and is now owned by competitor Bell Media) continued to use the brand under license from Rogers until 2011, when it was re-launched as CTV Morning Live upon the service's rebranding as CTV 2 Atlantic.
On September 5, 2011, each of the local editions of Breakfast Television across all of the Citytv owned-and-operated stations began starting a half-hour earlier, running from 5:30–9 a.m.[1]  In April 2012, the Winnipeg edition reverted to the 6-9 a.m. runtime.
In January 2015, the Winnipeg version of the program was discontinued, replaced with a simulcast of the CITI-FM morning show. In September 2019, the Montreal version of the program was discontinued, while the Calgary and Vancouver versions were re-launched on September 23, 2019 using a "hybrid" format incorporating segments of national interest from the Toronto version.[2][3][4]
On March 23, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Breakfast Television added a national hour, airing on all Citytv stations (outside of Citytv Saskatchewan) live at 9:00 a.m. EDT.
On November 17, 2020, BT Vancouver and BT Calgary were cancelled.[5] A national edition now aired in 8:30-10 a.m. local time on all Citytv stations (outside of Citytv Saskatchewan) as a replacement.


History[edit]
Former logo
Breakfast Television premiered on September 9, 1989 with co-hosts Ann Rohmer and David Onley, with MuchMusic VJ Steve Anthony broadcasting from a different spot around the area each day. Kevin Frankish handled news updates from the CityPulse (later CityNews) newsroom (he also handled the overnight updates broadcast from the assignment desk that flowed directly into BT). From 1995 to 2008, BT was simulcast on then-sister station CKVR in Barrie, with VRLand News inserts replacing the CityPulse/CityNews segments.
Co-host Liza Fromer quit her job at BT in July 2006, days after the birth of her child. Kevin Frankish has blogged that her departure from the show was "on the absolute best of terms". BT has encouraged people to send audition tapes for consideration.  During the summer of 2006, a number of CHUM personalities were invited to guest co-host with Kevin Frankish in the search for the next permanent host. The guest hosts included CityNews sports anchor Kathryn Humphreys, health specialist Laura DiBattista, consumer specialist Jee-Yun-Lee, former Citytv weather specialist Nalini Sharma, former reporter Melissa Grelo, etalk correspondent Tracy Melchor, BT's own Jennifer Valentyne, and Star!'s Dina Pugliese. On October 13, 2006, Dina Pugliese became the show's new co-host.
Every August since 2005, BT has organized a "Viewer Appreciation Day", held in the BT parking lot.[6] Gates open at 6 a.m., and closed due to capacity crowds early into 7 a.m. Some people began camping out at BT at 5:30 p.m. the day before the 2006 Viewer Appreciation Day.[6] Breakfast Television has also held other events, such as a successful world record attempt and a Christmas party. The BT Viewer Appreciation Day has since been canceled, with only the Christmas Party remaining.
Just as many people within the CityNews team started off on the CHUM phoneline, both Jennifer Valentyne and producer Kevin Forget started by working at "the BT Diner".[7]
In March 2019, BT Toronto hosted a week-long kid's competition called BT Kids Got Talent Week, where children showed their talent on the show. It was hosted by BT's Dina Pugliese and Devo Brown.[8]
In April 2020, during an interview on Breakfast Television, Simon Cowell announced a spin-off version of the show called Canadian Family's Got Talent carried out virtually by Citytv during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. The contest, presented by Canadian Tire, ran from April 27 to May 26 and was judged by Cowell alongside hosts Dina Pugliese and Devo Brown.[9] The contest was won by Toronto-based singing trio CZN.[10]
In July 2020, Roger Petersen announced that he would be leaving BT.[11]
On January 21, 2021, it was announced Sid Seixeiro of Sportsnet's Tim & Sid would become the new co-host of the program on March 10, 2021.[12]
On February 15, 2023, Dina Pugliese announced her departure from BT, and her last show was on February 24, 2023.[13]
On September 5, 2023, Meredith Shaw joined BT as the new co-host, replacing Pugliese.[14]

Spin-offs[edit]
Vancouver edition[edit]
CKVU launched Breakfast Television in 2002. The original hosts of Breakfast Television were Michael Eckford and Fiona Forbes, then they were replaced by Shane Foxman and Beverley Mahood, and since 2005, Simi Sara and Dave Gerry hosted the program, but as of August 13, 2008, they were let go.
On January 19, 2010, the length of BT was shortened from four hours to three hours, and six employees laid off as a result of "severe financial issues" with the Citytv stations.
A new format for Breakfast Television debuted in September 2008, with a new traffic and TransLink reporter. As part of Rogers Media's May 3, 2012 renewal of its affiliation agreement with Jim Pattison Group-owned Citytv affiliates CKPG-TV/Prince George, CFJC-TV/Kamloops and CHAT-TV/Medicine Hat, the three stations will begin simulcasting the Vancouver edition of Breakfast Television on September 1, 2012 as part of an expansion of Citytv programming on the stations, which will follow the program grid of CKVU (with breakaways from the Vancouver program grid for their weekday evening and midday newscasts and other locally produced programs).[15]
On September 5, 2019, Rogers laid off 4 employees from CKVU and placed Breakfast Television on hiatus until September 23. At this time the program was relaunched with a new hybrid format, consisting of a mixture of local content with national entertainment and lifestyle segments produced from Toronto.[2][3][4]
On November 17, 2020, Rogers Sports & Media imposed staff cuts across the country, including cancelling Breakfast Television in Vancouver and Calgary.[16]

Calgary edition[edit]
CHUM Limited purchased Craig Media in late 2004. The $265 million deal included, among other things, Craig's three A-Channel stations (CKAL-TV in Calgary, Alberta; CKEM-TV in Edmonton, Alberta and CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba).
In February 2005, CHUM announced that the A-Channel stations would be relaunched as Citytv stations by that fall. The morning show on the original A-Channel stations, The Big Breakfast, was relaunched as Breakfast Television on August 2, 2005 alongside their re-branding as Citytv. The A-Channel brand was subsequently transferred to CHUM's NewNet stations, whose own morning programs were retitled A-Channel Morning.
As in Vancouver, Rogers made cuts to Breakfast Television in Calgary in September 2019, placing the program on hiatus and re-launching it on September 23 with the same, aforementioned format changes.[2][3][4]
Former presenters

Ross Hull - Live Eye reporter
Dave Kelly - Main anchor (2005–2009)

Winnipeg edition[edit]
CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba produced a version of Breakfast Television from August 2, 2005 to January 6, 2015 - the station was purchased along with CKAL-DT in Calgary and CKEM-DT in Edmonton. The final hosts were Courtney Ketchen, Jeremy John, Jenna Khan and Drew Kozub. It was replaced with a simulcast of Wheeler in the Morning—the morning show of sister radio station CITI-FM—starting on January 12, 2015. Khan and Kozub were retained as co-hosts for news and entertainment segments shown during the program on television in place of music.[18]
Former presenters

Pay Chen - Host (2009-2011)
Jon Ljungberg - Host (?-2010)[19]
Erin Selby - Host (2005-2007)
Atlantic Canada edition[edit]
From 1992 to 2011, the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) in Atlantic Canada, now known as CTV Two Atlantic, aired its own local version of BT. At the time of its launch, ASN and Citytv (Toronto) were both owned by CHUM Limited, and both channels had a similar overall movies-focused format. The Atlantic edition of BT was similar to the Toronto version, but with a greater emphasis on the culture of the region, as matters such as commuter traffic are typically less of a concern in Atlantic Canada.
ASN was acquired by Baton Broadcasting (predecessor of the present-day Bell Media) in 1997, but was permitted to continue using Breakfast Television as the title of its morning show. In August 2011, the program was re-branded as CTV Morning Live, in keeping with the launch (or relaunch) of local morning shows under the same title on CTV and CTV Two stations in various parts of Canada.

Edmonton edition[edit]
On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced the cancellation of Breakfast Television in Edmonton as part of cutbacks.[20] It was replaced by a spin-off known as Dinner Television, which was a two-hour weeknight newsmagazine which did not contain original news reporting. Encores of the previous edition of Dinner Television with an "L-bar" displaying updated news and weather information were broadcast during its former morning timeslot.[20][21][22] Dinner Television was subsequently cancelled and replaced by the newly relaunched CityNews in 2017.[23] The morning timeslot is now filled by CityLine.
Former presenters

Bill Welychka - Host (2005-2006)
Montreal edition[edit]
Rogers was granted approval by the CRTC on December 20, 2012 to acquire CJNT Montreal and convert it from a multicultural station to a fully English Citytv station. As part of the approval, Rogers had until September 1, 2013 to produce local programming on the station, which included a three-hour Montreal edition of Breakfast Television.[24]
On June 6, 2013, Rogers announced that the Montreal edition of Breakfast Television would premiere on August 26, 2013, and would be hosted by Alexandre Despatie and Joanne Vrakas.[25] Despatie left the program in 2015, and was succeeded by Derick Fage.[26]
On September 5, 2019, Rogers Media announced the cancellation of Breakfast Television Montreal, effective immediately. Colette Watson, senior vice-president of television and broadcast operations at Rogers Media, stated: "This was a difficult decision, but at the end of the day, the show was not sustainable".[27]

"Dr. Funkenstein" is a song by the funk band Parliament. It was the second single released from their 1976 album, The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein. It reached number 46 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart.[1]
Dr. Funkenstein was one of George Clinton's many alter egos in the P-Funk mythology.
A live version of the song was performed by the  Red Hot Chili Peppers in the late eighties and appears on the 1998 compilation, Under the Covers: Essential Red Hot Chili Peppers.
In the 2015 Doctor Who episode "The Zygon Invasion", the Twelfth Doctor identifies himself as "Dr. Funkenstein".

The Christmas Martian (French: Le Martien de Noël) is a Canadian children's Christmas comedy film, directed by Bernard Gosselin and released in 1971.[1] The film stars Marcel Sabourin as Poo Flower, an extraterrestrial being from Mars who lands his spaceship near a small town in Northern Quebec during the Christmas season, befriending the local children but alarming their parents.[2]
The film's cast also includes Catherine Leduc, François Gosselin, Guy L'Écuyer, Roland Chenail, Paul Hébert, Louise Poulin-Roy, Paul Berval, Ernest Guimond, Yvan Canuel, Yvon Leroux and Reine Malo, as well as narration by Marc-André Coallier.
It was the first children's film ever made in Canada by a commercial studio independently of either the National Film Board of Canada or the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.[2] After producer Rock Demers launched the Tales for All series of children's films in the 1980s, the film was retroactively incorporated into that series.[3]


Reception[edit]
Canuxploitation, a film blog devoted to Canadian B-movies, wrote that the film was "easily the most insane example of Canadian children's cinema ever conceived. Nonsensical and embarrassingly low-budget, Le Martien de Noël wildly bounces from wacky action sequences to unrelated tangents, all highlighted by special effects even the most distracted seven year-old could see through. In other words, it's great!"[4]

Availability[edit]
The film has occasionally been rebroadcast on television during the Christmas season, most commonly on science fiction channels.[5] RiffTrax released a version with a mocking audio commentary track on December 15, 2023.[6]

AMTPA was contained in title VIII of the Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act passed in 1982
Mortgages allowed by the act included:

Adjustable-rate mortgages, in which the interest rate becomes floating after a number of years.
Balloon payment mortgages have a large payment remaining when the loan comes due.
Interest-only mortgages only require the borrower to pay the interest on the principal balance for the first years of the loan.[1]
The United States House of Representatives passed H.R.3915 "The Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act of 2007" in November, 2007. It remains before the United States Senate.[2] The House bill would require lenders to write mortgages that take into account the borrowers' ability to pay at the fully indexed rate.[1]

A plaintiff (or other person bringing a civil action, such as a petitioner) drops his or her suit, under certain circumstances that do not prevent another action being brought later on the same facts.


United States[edit]
In the United States, a voluntary nonsuit is a motion taken by the plaintiff to release one or more of the defendants from liability.
An example would be a plaintiff suing a physician and a hospital for damages resulting from surgical complications.  If the plaintiff settles with the physician, the plaintiff would nonsuit the physician (removing him/her from the suit) but maintain action against the hospital and the suit would continue.  If the plaintiff later settles with the hospital before trial, the resulting nonsuit would end the case as all defendants have been released.
A nonsuit is a right of the plaintiff, but it may be prevented if the defendant has pleaded for affirmative relief.
The law in the United States was established as early as 1828 when the Supreme Court ruled:

A nonsuit, may not be ordered by the Court, upon the application of the defendant, and cannot as we have had occasion to decide, at the present term, be ordered in any case without the consent and acquiescence of the plaintiff[1]
A compulsory nonsuit is a decision by a court that a case cannot proceed to trial, either on substantive or procedural grounds. Depending on which grounds the nonsuit is entered, the plaintiff may or may not be able to file his case again.  
In the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the term does not appear, but a dismissal under Rules 12 and 41 has a similar effect.
Often, the term "nonsuit" will appear in older U.S. cases. The meaning of the term in most of these older cases is the same as described for the United Kingdom (see below). This is because most colonies, upon separation from England, still used English common law (as no U.S. or state-specific laws had yet been passed). In more modern parlance, this type of motion is known as a "motion of dismissal".
A few code pleading states, such as California and Pennsylvania, still use the term "nonsuit" to refer to an involuntary or compulsory nonsuit which is granted at the request of an opponent. In such circumstances it is functionally equivalent to a motion for a directed verdict or judgment as a matter of law. For example, in California, a motion for nonsuit under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 581c "is a procedural device which allows a defendant to challenge the sufficiency of plaintiff's evidence to submit the case to the jury," and it cannot be granted if the plaintiff's evidence would be sufficient to support a jury verdict in the plaintiff's favor.[2]

Virginia[edit]
In Virginia, which does not follow the Federal Rules, a nonsuit is known by that name.  A nonsuit is simply an agreement by the plaintiff not to proceed in that suit against that defendant, and is not a bar to bringing a future action against the same defendant.[3]  There are restrictions on when a Virginia nonsuit may be taken, and only one nonsuit may be taken against a party on a cause of action as a matter of right.[4] Within the limitations, a plaintiff has an absolute right to one nonsuit.[5] A Virginia plaintiff who takes a nonsuit may bring a new action against the same defendant(s) on the same subject matter within six months, regardless of the operation of the Statute of Limitations.[6] The difference between a Federal Rule 41 dismissal and a Virginia nonsuit is more a matter of form than substance, although the Virginia statute does not require the consent of the defendant and can be taken at later stages in the proceeding.[7]
A nonsuit is often taken by a plaintiff who anticipates a judgment or ruling that "imparts finality" against him, who wants to avoid the adverse judgment and preserve at least the possibility of prevailing on the merits of his case in the future.[8]

United Kingdom[edit]
England and Wales[edit]
In the common law courts (e.g. the Court of Common Pleas) a party to a civil action had a right of withdraw their claim/counterclaim by nonsuit up until verdict or judgment without prejudice to the launch of a fresh action.[9] There was an equivalent right in the Court of Chancery to dismiss one's own bill (as actions in that court were known as).[10] When the courts were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875, provision was made for the procedure to governed by rules of court. The 1875 rules provided for non suiting but also made provision for setting aside a judgment of nonsuit. In 1883 the nonsuit provisions were repealed and replaced by discontinuance of an action.
Thereafter it was subsequently ruled that nonsuiting ceased to exist in the High Court of Justice having been wholly displaced by the provisions relating to discontinuance.[11]
In the County Courts, the County Court rules continued to provide for nonsuiting until the Rules of the Supreme Court and the County Court Rules were repealed and replaced by the Civil Procedure Rules 1998,[12] which only provided for discontinuance. This brought nonsuiting to an end in mainstream England and Wales (although one cannot comment for e.g. actions in the High Court of Chivalry).[13]

Northern Ireland[edit]
The present court rules[14] make no provision for nonsuiting and provide instead for discontinuance. One therefore presumes nonsuiting no longer exists in Northern Ireland, applying the same principles as in England and Wales.[citation needed]

Scotland[edit]
The position in Scotland is unknown.[citation needed]

(3) Once the evidence had been completed and the verdict of the jury taken—or, where there was no jury, once the judge had found the facts—it seems clear that the court had an unfettered discretion, if the verdict was against the plaintiff, either to enter a nonsuit or to give judgment for the defendant."

Launch on warning (LOW), or fire on warning,[1][2] is a strategy of nuclear weapon retaliation that gained recognition during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the invention of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), launch on warning became an integral part of mutually-assured destruction (MAD) theory. Under the strategy, a retaliatory strike is launched upon warning of enemy nuclear attack while its missiles are still in the air and before detonation occurs. US land-based missiles can reportedly be launched within 5 minutes of a presidential decision to do so and submarine-based missiles within 15 minutes.[3]


History[edit]
Before the introduction of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) had multiple bombers on patrol at all times in a program known as Operation Chrome Dome.[4] In the event of a Soviet nuclear strike, SAC would order its already-airborne bombers to fly to the other country and to drop their nuclear payload on predetermined targets. The bombers were typically either B-47 Stratojets or B-52 Stratofortresses, and there were three major flight routes. Keeping bombers in the air assured that a second strike would be feasible even if the first strike impaired ground facilities. At the height of the Cold War, the US had special Boeing EC-135 "Looking Glass" aircraft that were equipped as control centers for the nuclear arsenal. The battle staff included a general or flag officer, who was authorized to order a retaliatory strike if the President could not be contacted.[5]
Launch on warning has its roots in US President Dwight Eisenhower's "Positive Control" strategy but really took shape with the introduction of the Minuteman missile. Since many ICBMs, including the Minuteman, were launched from underground silos, the concern arose that a first strike by one nation could destroy the ground launch facilities of the retaliating nation.
In 1997, a US official stated that the US had the technical capability for launch on warning but did not intend to use a launch on warning posture and that the position had not changed in the 1997 presidential decision directive on nuclear weapon doctrine.[6]
There were two primary options. One option, "retaliation after ride-out," required the second-strike nation to wait until after it had been attacked to launch its missiles. Some portion of the nuclear arsenal would inevitably be destroyed in such an attack, which led to both superpowers investing heavily in survivable-basing modes[7] for their nuclear forces, including hardened underground missile silos for ICBMs,[8][better source needed] and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The other choice was "launch on warning," the launch of nuclear missiles before the other side's missiles could destroy them. That became possible primarily because of improvements in missile technology that allowed for faster launches.[9] The capability was further enhanced in the 1970s with the deployment of space-based launch detection technology on both sides: the American geosynchronous Defense Support Program and Soviet Oko satellites. Evidence found in declassified documents suggests that launch on warning was, at least in part, US policy from the late 1950s to at least the 1970s.[9] The U.S. nuclear weapons employment policy was modified slightly in 1981, stipulating that the U.S. was henceforth "not to rely on launching our nuclear forces in an irrevocable manner" upon receipt of information that a Soviet missile attack was underway, but that the U.S. "must be prepared to launch our recallable bomber forces upon warning that a Soviet nuclear attack has been initiated."[10]
Strategies are available that can reduce the effectiveness of a launch-on-warning stance. For example, the first-strike nation can use a technique, called X-ray pin-down, to delay a retaliatory response. It involves a barrage of submarine-based missiles fired from close range in a "depressed trajectory" mode that reaches its targets in minutes. The warheads would be set to explode every minute or so at high altitudes, which would significantly disrupt the attacked nation's ability to launch its own ICBMs.[11][12]

Bell said the press had incorrectly indicated that the PDD "still allows" the United States to launch nuclear weapons upon receiving warning of an attack. Bell emphasized that "there is no change in this PDD with respect to U.S. policy on launch on warning and that policy is that we do not, not rely on it." In fact, Bell said "in this PDD we direct our military forces to continue to posture themselves in such a way as to not rely on launch on warning—to be able to absorb a nuclear strike and still have enough force surviving to constitute credible deterrence." Bell pointed out that while the United States has always had the "technical capability" to implement a policy of launch on warning, it has chosen not to do so. "Our policy is to confirm that we are under nuclear attack with actual detonations before retaliating," he said.

Plot[edit]

In the world of underground motorcycle drag racing, the undefeated champion Smoke is the undisputed "King of Cali", fending off challengers for his crown. Racing prodigy Kid has been assisting his father, mechanic Slick Will, as they prepare Smoke's bike for racing. In narration, Kid quotes his dad as saying "the difference between men and boys is the lessons they learn" and adds that his father taught him plenty.
A local biker issues a challenge to Smoke, who accepts. Smoke, utilizing "tunnel vision", wins the race but the challenger crashes into a row of parked bikes. Upended, the motorcycle strikes Slick Will and throws him through a plate storefront window. Both men are instantly killed. At Slick Will's funeral, Smoke leads dozens of bikers from the "Black Knights" to offer his condolences to Slick Will's widow Anita. They drop a Black Knights flag into his grave; Kid is unimpressed with the gesture.
Six months later, Kid, a now capable rider who is hustling with fellow racer Stuntman, attend a biker party where Kid and Stuntman hustle a fellow racer named Donny after Kid disrupted a race between Donny and Stuntman to show off his new bike and impress a woman he met in the crowd, Tina. To cover their tracks, fellow biker Primo suggests that the trio form a bike club. Kid starts a romance with Tina. Kid makes amends to the biker jury consisting of 10 leaders of the most powerful biker gangs following his stunt. He apologizes for his disrespect towards Smoke, their chairman, and they agree to verify the new club with the trio calling themselves "Biker Boyz".
Smoke is challenged by leader of the Strays and long-time rival Dogg, and the two wager thousands and the title. The day of the race, Smoke defeats Dogg and afterwards, in late but stunting fashion, the Biker Boyz arrive. Kid trash talks Motherland in an impromptu move to provoke Smoke. Smoke is unamused with Kid's bid to "make an entrance" and the Black Knights exit. Motherland and Kid race until police arrive and arrest Kid. A lawyer for the Black Knights bails Kid out and Anita confronts him, threatening to kick Kid out if he races again.
The night of the Black Knights annual dance, Kid is challenged by proxy to race Dogg and accepts after a squabble with Tina's brother and Stray mechanic Wood. Anita finds Smoke before the race and demands that he stop it. Smoke and Anita argue until she relents, telling Smoke that Kid is his son and not Slick Will's. Incredulous, Smoke is moved to act and manages to draw Kid into an altercation. Kid attacks Smoke, but gets his keys confiscated and knocked out, averting the race.
Recovering at home, Kid confronts Anita, who confesses. Enraged, Kid moves in with Tina. Kid elects to go rogue and after gaining more followers for his club, gathers his team. When Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is overpowered by the leader of the other club who pulls a gun. Smoke and a group of Black Knights intervene and convince the vengeful bikers to stand down. Smoke and Kid have a sit down at the Biker Boyz spot but Kid is more dismissive and angry as ever. Smoke agrees to race Kid under the condition that whoever loses will never race again, but first Smoke has to allow Kid to race Dogg at the next circuit event. Soon thereafter Kid reconciles with Anita.
At the race track, Kid and his team face the Strays with Smoke and the Black Knights at watch from the stands. Dogg and Kid race down the strip until Dogg does a "bump and run" causing Kid to "lay the bike down" into a crash. Although Kid is unhurt, his bike is wrecked. Smoke informs Kid that the authorities are closing the track, due to the amount of crashes, but he has managed to rent a farm outside of town, securing their race. Kid agrees to arrive the next day.
Kid, Primo, and Stuntman try to fix Kid's bike when the Strays arrive to confront them. Wood confirms that the damage is too severe to mend in time for the race. Dogg concedes that only their bikes are as strong and fast as Smoke's. As a peace offering, Dogg lends Kid his bike.
The following day, Black Knights and Biker Boyz arrive and line up in opposing formation in the open field. Smoke calls for a fair race, with no nitrous oxide system; Kid wants Tina to call the start. Smoke and Kid race on a dirt road behind the farm and Kid adopts Smoke's "tunnel vision" with the finish line in sight. On course to win, Smoke is suddenly filled with emotions and instead slows down to let his son win, giving way to Kid becoming the new "King of Cali".
Smoke relinquishes the crown to a humbled and respectful Kid who tells Smoke to keep his helmet. Kid watches on as his father rides off into the sunset and in narration repeats Slick Will’s sentiment in full context that "the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn" and adds that his father taught him plenty.

It succeeded the second Adenan cabinet, which dissolved on 11 January 2017 following the death of the previous Chief Minister Adenan Satem.[2][3][4]
The cabinet consists of ministers and assistant ministers from PBB, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), Parti Rakyat Sarawak (PRS) and Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) and it remained in office during the departure of the four governing parties from the Barisan Nasional coalition and the formation of the Gabungan Parti Sarawak coalition on 12 June 2018.
The cabinet was dissolved on 4 January 2022, just after the Second Abang Johari cabinet was sworn into office with effect.

Horace Jerome D'Amato (August 24, 1927[1] – January 24, 1979), known professionally as Jerry Damon, was an American radio and television announcer and actor.

Biography[edit]
Damon was a staff announcer for NBC in New York from 1954[2] until his death.  He was part of a core group that, during his years with the network, also included voice-over artists Bill Wendell, Don Pardo, Mel Brandt, Wayne Howell, Vic Roby and Howard Reig.  He handled network program introductions and closes, bumpers, promos, and teasers.  He also handled occasional sign-offs and live tags, for the network's New York flagship station WNBC-TV and its radio sister stations (WNBC (AM), which became WFAN and WNBC-FM/WNWS/WYNY, later WQHT).
Damon's radio announcing credits include Monitor, the original version of X Minus One, and The Eternal Light.  His main television credits were the 1964-65 American version of That Was the Week That Was, plus other shows for which he announced, G.E. College Bowl, Haggis Baggis and The Jan Murray Show.  He also was a spokesman for coverage of political conventions, and from 1975 to 1977, he was food editor for NBC's ill-fated News and Information Service radio network.
Outside of the announcing booth, Damon owned a dairy farm in Milford, New York.  In addition, in the early 1960s, he was part of a group that made a bid to purchase Ellis Island.[3]
Damon died of cancer at Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark, New Jersey at age 51.[2]

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to forensic science:
Forensic science – application of a broad spectrum of sciences to answer questions of interest to a legal system. This may be in matters relating to criminal law, civil law and regulatory laws. it may also relate to non-litigious matters.  The term is  often shortened to forensics.


Nature of forensic science[edit]
General forensics topics include:

Crime – breach of rules or laws for which some governing authority (via mechanisms such as legal systems) can ultimately prescribe a conviction.
Crime scene – location where an illegal act took place, and comprises the area from which most of the physical evidence is retrieved by trained law enforcement personnel, crime scene investigators (CSIs) or in rare circumstances, forensic scientists.
Mortuary investigations
laboratory examinations
CSI effect – phenomenon of popular television shows such as the CSI franchise raising the public's expectations of forensic science,[1] stemming from the "dramatic license" taken by the shows' writers in which they exaggerate the abilities of forensic science,[2][3] and this is of particular concern in the courtroom setting, where many prosecutors feel pressured to deliver more forensic evidence.[4][5]
Forensic methodologies[edit]
Crime Scene Investigation: crime scene is the most fruitful source to gather forensic evidence (19)
Forensic accounting – study and interpretation of accounting evidence.
Forensic animation –
Forensic anthropology – application of physical anthropology for personnel identification in a legal setting, usually for the recovery and identification of skeletonized human remains.
Forensic facial reconstruction – Skull-face photo superimposition. skull suture identification with ante mortem skull x-rays
Forensic arts – artistic techniques used in the identification, apprehension, or conviction of wanted persons.
Forensic astronomy – determines past celestial constellations for forensic purposes, using methods from astronomy.
Bloodstain pattern analysis – draws on the scientific disciplines of biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics to ascertain the details and sequence of events of a crime, including the area of origin of an impact pattern, and movement of persons or objects after bloodshed, etc.
Forensic botany – study of plant life  in order to gain information regarding possible crimes.
Forensic chemistry – study of detection and identification of illicit drugs, accelerants used in arson cases, explosive and gunshot residue.
Computational forensics – quantitative approach involving computer-based modeling, computer simulation, analysis, and recognition in studying and solving problems posed in various forensic disciplines. Concerns the development of algorithms and software to assist forensic examination.
Criminalistics – analysis of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Applies various sciences to answer questions relating to examination and comparison of biological evidence, trace evidence, impression evidence (such as fingerprints, footwear impressions, and tire tracks), controlled substances, ballistics, firearm and toolmark examination, and other evidence in criminal investigations. In typical circumstances, evidence is processed in a crime lab.
Forensic ballistics – methods of investigating the use of firearms and ammunition, and application of ballistics to legal questions.
Ballistic fingerprinting – forensic techniques that rely on marks that firearms leave on bullets to match a bullet to the gun it was fired with.[6]
Forensic DNA analysis takes advantage of the uniqueness of an individual's DNA to answer forensic questions such as paternity/maternity testing or placing a suspect at a crime scene, e.g., in a rape investigation.
Impression evidence analysis
Forensic dactyloscopy – study of fingerprints.
Forensic podiatry is an application of the study of foot, footprint or footwear and their traces to analyze scene of crime and to establish personal identity in forensic examinations.
Forensic toxicology – the study of the effect of drugs and poisons on the human body.
Trace evidence analysis is the analysis and comparison of trace evidence including glass, paint, fibers, hair, etc.
Digital forensics – application of proven scientific methods and techniques in order to recover or investigate data from electronic or digital media, often in relation to computer crime.
Mobile device forensics – scientific examination, and evaluation of evidences found in Mobile Phone, e.g. Call History, Deleted SMS etc., also include SIM Card Forensics
Forensic document examination or questioned document examination answers questions about a disputed document using a variety of scientific processes and methods. Many examinations involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, to a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting wherein the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship.
Forensic economics – the study and interpretation of economic damage evidence to include present day calculations of lost earnings and benefits, lost earnings and profits, etc.
Forensic engineering –  investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. Also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery.
Forensic materials engineering – focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal.
Forensic polymer engineering – study of failure in polymeric products. Applicable in accident investigations.
Forensic entomology – examination of insects in, on, and around human remains to assist in determination of time or location of death. It is also possible to determine if the body was moved after death.
Forensic geology – examination and analysis of trace evidence in the form of soils, minerals and petroleum.
Forensic identification – technology and procedures to identify specific objects from the trace evidence they leave, often at a crime scene or the scene of an accident.
Forensic limnology – analysis of evidence collected from crime scenes in or around fresh water sources. Examination of biological organisms, in particular, diatoms, can be useful in connecting suspects with victims.
Forensic linguistics  – deals with issues in the legal system that requires linguistic expertise.
Forensic meteorology – site specific analysis of past weather conditions for a point of loss.
Forensic odontology – study of the uniqueness of teeth, mainly for the purpose of corpse identification
Forensic optometry – study of glasses and other eyewear relating to crime scenes and criminal investigations
Forensic pathology is a field in which the principles of medicine and pathology are applied to determine a cause of death or injury in the context of a legal inquiry.
Forensic photography – the art of producing an accurate photographic reproduction of a crime scene to aid investigations and court proceedings.

Forensic psychiatry – the two main areas of criminal evaluations in forensic psychiatry are evaluating a defendant's competency to stand trial (CST) and determining a defendant's mental state at the time of the offense (MSO).
Forensic psychology – study of the mind of an individual, using forensic methods. Usually it determines the circumstances behind a criminal's behavior.
Forensic seismology – study of techniques to distinguish the seismic signals generated by underground nuclear explosions from those generated by earthquakes.
Forensic serology – study of the body fluids.[7]

History of forensic science[edit]
Main article: Forensic science § History
By period[edit]
Forensics in antiquity – ancient sources contain several accounts of techniques that foreshadow the concepts of forensic science that were made possible by the Scientific Revolution centuries later. Predating the scientific method, these techniques were not based on a scientific understanding of the world in the modern sense, but rather on common sense and practical experience.
By subject[edit]
History of autopsies – Autopsies that opened the body to determine the cause of death were attested at least in the early third millennium BC, although they were opposed in many ancient societies where it was believed that the outward disfigurement of dead persons prevented them from entering the afterlife.[8]
History of dissection – Roman law forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body,[9] so physicians such as Galen were unable to work on cadavers.  Galen for example dissected the Barbary macaque and other primates, assuming their anatomy was basically the same as that of humans.[10][11][12]
Evidence[edit]
Ballistic impact – high velocity impact by small mass simulation analogous to runway debris or small arms fire.[13]
Calling card – particular object sometimes left behind by a criminal at a scene of a crime, often as a way of taunting police or obliquely claiming responsibility.
Fingerprint – an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger.[14] In a wider use of the term, fingerprints are the traces of an impression from the friction ridges of any part of a human or other primate hand.
Footprints – impressions or images left behind by a person walking. Shoes have many different prints based on the sole design and the wear that it has received – this can help to identify suspects.[15]
Skid mark –  mark a tire makes when a vehicle wheel stops rolling and slides or spins on the surface of the road. Skid marks are important for finding the maximum and minimum vehicle speed prior to the impact or incident.
Trace evidence – evidence that occurs when different objects contact one another. Such materials are often transferred by heat induced by contact friction.

Fritz Ernst Fischer (5 October 1912 – 2003) was a Nazi German medical doctor who performed medical atrocities on inmates of the Ravensbrück concentration camp.[1] He was tried and convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1947 Doctors' Trial; he was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his sentence was commuted to 15 years and he was released in 1954.


Early life and war crimes[edit]
Fischer was born in Berlin. He studied medicine first at Bonn, later at Berlin and Leipzig, and finally graduated in Hamburg in 1938. He joined the SS in 1934 (ultimately reaching the rank of Sturmbannführer [major]) and became a member of the NSDAP in June 1937. On 1 November 1939, he was assigned to the Waffen-SS of the SS-Department of the Hohenlychen Sanatorium as a physician and SS Second Lieutenant.[citation needed]
In 1940, he became troop physician of the SS Division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. After having been wounded he was posted back to Hohenlychen and worked in the camp hospital of the Ravensbrück concentration camp as a surgical assistant to Karl Gebhardt. He participated in the surgical experiments carried out on concentration camp inmates there.[2]

Trial and later life[edit]
After World War II, he was tried in the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg, convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was condemned to life imprisonment. His sentence was reduced to 15 years in 1951 and he was released in March 1954.
Fischer subsequently regained his license to practice medicine and started a new career at the chemical company Boehringer in Ingelheim, where he stayed until his retirement.[3]
Based on available records, when he died in 2003, aged 90 or 91, he was the last known living of those indicted at the Doctors' Trial.[citation needed]

Morrison & Sinclair was a Sydney, New South Wales based company and one of the great ship and boatbuilding names of Port Jackson. The company was founded in the early 1890s and ceased trading in 1970.


History[edit]
In 1923, Morrison & Sinclair Ltd transferred from Johnstons Bay in Balmain to a site at the end of Long Nose Point on the Balmain Peninsula and carried out a shipbuilding operations there until the company ceased trading in 1970.
The company designed, constructed and repaired Government vessels, naval, island trading and merchant ships and many Sydney Ferries and yachts. The yacht Morna (later Kurrewa IV), which won line honours 7 times from 10 starts in the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, was built here. (But, MORNA was built in 1913 - obviously at the Johnstons Bay site).  Morrison & Sinclair Ltd no longer exists but the records of the company are held by the State Library of New South Wales.
On 17 June 1971, the shipbuilding land was acquired by the State Planning Authority of New South Wales for A$185,000. Landscaping was carried out by Bruce Mackenzie & Associates and the site, then known as Long Nose Park, placed under Leichhardt Council control in 1981. The park won the 1986 Australian Institute of Landscape Architects Award of Merit. The park has since been renamed Yurulbin Park.

Today part ofGermany1: Until 1806, Frankfurt was known as the "Free Imperial City of Frankfurt" Freie Reichsstadt Frankfurt. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the imperial part of the name was dropped upon the city-state's restoration in 1815.
For almost five centuries, the German city of Frankfurt was a city-state within two major Germanic entities:

The Holy Roman Empire as the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt (German: Freie Reichsstadt Frankfurt) (until 1806)
The German Confederation as the Free City of Frankfurt (Freie Stadt Frankfurt) (1815–66)
Frankfurt was a major city of the Holy Roman Empire, being the seat of imperial elections since 885 and the city for imperial coronations from 1562 (previously in Free Imperial City of Aachen) until 1792. Frankfurt was declared an Imperial Free City (Freie und Reichsstadt) in 1372, making the city an entity of Imperial immediacy, meaning immediately subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor and not to a regional ruler or a local nobleman.
Due to its imperial significance, Frankfurt survived mediatisation in 1803. Following the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Frankfurt fell to the rule of Napoleon I, who granted the city to Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg; the city became known as the Principality of Frankfurt. The Catholic cleric Dalberg emancipated Catholics living with the city boundary. In 1810 Dalberg merged Frankfurt with the Principality of Aschaffenburg, the County of Wetzlar, Fulda, and Hanau to form the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt. After the defeat of Napoleon and the collapse of the Confederation of the Rhine, Frankfurt was returned to its pre-Napoleonic constitution via the Congress of Vienna of 1815 and became a sovereign city-state and a member of the German Confederation.
During the period of the German Confederation, Frankfurt continued to be a major city. The confederation's governing body, the Bundestag (officially called the Bundesversammlung, Federal Assembly) was located in the Palais Thurn und Taxis in Frankfurt's city centre. During the Revolutions of 1848, the Frankfurt Parliament was formed in an attempt to unite the German states in a democratic manner. It was here that King Frederick William IV of Prussia refused the offer of the crown of "Little Germany", because it was offered to him by a popularly elected assembly composed of revolutionaries whom he opposed, and because he regarded the offer of the crown, only as the right of the ruling monarchs of the individual German states.
In 1866 the Kingdom of Prussia went to war with the Austrian Empire over Schleswig-Holstein, causing the Austro-Prussian War. Frankfurt, remaining loyal to the German Confederation, did not join with Prussia, but remained neutral. Following Prussia's victory, Frankfurt was annexed by decree of the King of Prussia on 20 September, and became part of the newly formed Province of Hesse-Nassau.

Development of the city[edit]
Next to the main street Zeil, at the Roßmarkt, along the city ring and at the banks of the River Main, the wealthy population of the city had spacious houses erected by architects such as Salins de Montfort and Friedrich Rumpf. They also endowed several scientific societies, for example the Polytechnische Gesellschaft and the Physikalischen Verein. In 1819 Freiherr vom Stein founded the Gesellschaft für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde (Monumenta Germaniae Historica). In 1825, municipal architect Johann Friedrich Christian Hess built the representative city library. At the same time, the new construction of the Senckenbergische Naturforschende Gesellschaft was developed at the Eschenheimer Turm. This is where Eduard Rüppell started his extended research expeditions to Africa. The Städelschule, which was opened in 1829, attracted renowned artists from all over Europe, among others Bertel Thorvaldsen, Philipp Veit, Eduard von Steinle and Moritz von Schwind. Civic foundations and clubs also fostered the city's culture life, e.g. the Frankfurter Kunstverein, the Museumsgesellschaft, the Cäcilienverein and the Städtische Theater.
In 1828 city gardener Sebastian Rinz set aside land for a new main cemetery and a new Jewish cemetery, about 15 minutes from the old city walls. The old cemeteries, which dated back to the Middle Ages, the Peterskirchhof and the old Jewish cemetery were closed. Also in 1828 the company Knoblauch & Schiele, the first gasworks, started to provide private households with gas.
In 1830 the city arranged the maintenance of the churches owned by the city, the priest's salaries and the clerical school system in two endowment contracts. A lot of the older and smaller churches, especially the former monasteries, which had been secularized in 1803 decayed or were used for profane purposes. But on the other hand, the new construction of the Paulskirche, which had been in ruins since 1789, was finally completed.
The city's urban area only slowly grew beyond the area of the ramparts, which were built on the area of the old city fortifications, firstly along the old country roads. Up until 1837, the wrought-iron gates to the city were closed at nightfall. Whoever was late had to pay a fee – like in the Middle Ages – called "Sperrbatzen", which led to bloody fights ("Sperrbatzenkrawall") in 1830 and 1831.

Frankfurt as an important centre of transport and trade[edit]
The Alte Börse (Old Stock Exchange) in 1845
During the years in which Frankfurt was a "Free City", the traditional Frankfurt Trade Fair was of little importance. Nevertheless, Frankfurt rose to be one of the major centres for trade and finances in Europe. The most important banking house in Frankfurt belonged to the Rothschild family, who established banking and finance houses all over Europe. The only other banking house that was comparable to the Rothschild bank was the Christian-owned Bethmann Bank. Both of these banks dominated the trading of bonds for different European countries.
There were several significant uprisings against plans to develop a Prussian Tariff Union because they threatened to undermine Frankfurt's role as a centre of transport and trade. In 1828 the city joined Middle Germany's trade association which was against Prussian activities. However, they were not able to prevent their neighbouring state, the Grand Duchy of Hesse, from joining the customs union. After the founding of Germany's Customs Union in 1834 of which Nassau also became a member, Frankfurt was the only city that was not part of the Customs Union, in contrast to the surrounding area. Within a short period of time, trade in Frankfurt had been dramatically reduced. Meanwhile, the trade of neighbouring cities, like Offenbach, Höchst and Bockenheim, flourished. In 1836 the Free City of Frankfurt was the last one to join the German Customs Union.
The fortunate location of the city led to the development of Frankfurt becoming a transportation hub. In 1832 Britain and Frankfurt signed a contract allowing free trade and shipping. For this purpose the city flag was designed using the traditional colours of Frankfurt: two red and two white stripes with the Frankfurt Eagle in the upper left corner.
From the beginning, the city had a leading role in the expansion of the German railway system. All the bankers from Frankfurt supported the initiative and the first railway shares were in great interest. Nevertheless, negotiations went slowly and the initial construction of the railway did not start until 1839.

Frankfurt becomes the federal capital[edit]
The Palais Thurn und Taxis, here a photo from around 1900, was the former seat of the Bundestag, the assembly of the German states.
The Bundestag was headquartered in Palais Thurn und Taxis in the Großen Eschenheimer Straße starting from 5 November 1816. The member states established delegations in the city. The Central Federal Bureau for Investigations (German: Bundes-Central-Behörde für Untersuchungen), a central coordinating institution of the political police for the federal member states, had been based in Frankfurt since the 1830s.

Black-red-gold[edit]
Main article: Frankfurt Parliament
Frankfurt was one of the major centres of the revolutionary movement "Vormärz" (lit: "pre-March"). The journalist Ludwig Börne was born in 1786 in a street named "Judengasse" ("Jew Lane") in the Jewish ghetto of Frankfurt. Ludwig Börne was the author of satirical writings and later became one of the prominent figures of the literary movement "Young Germany". Because the Federal Assembly and Frankfurt's city authorities feared for their reputation, they tried to ban political unions and to suppress the circulation of liberal publications. They were, however, not successful in their attempts to do this. Spurred on by the July Revolution of 1830, opposition groups in the city of Frankfurt were ablaze with a revolutionary spirit. But the step from idealistic fervour to decisive action failed completely. Made up mostly of students and Polish officers in exile, a group attempting to start a revolution in Germany, called Frankfurter Wachensturm because of attacks made on police stations (German Wachen), was betrayed on 3 April 1833 to the police and was brutally put down by the city's small army. The incident, while largely ineffective, did, however, have a chilling effect on the bourgeois elite of the city because as a result 2,500 Austrian and Prussian soldiers were stationed in the city, representing a direct challenge to the sovereignty of the city which, in turn, led to royal government diplomats denigrating the Free City as a "liberal cesspit".

Goethe memorial, established in 1844 by Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler
German national consciousness grew throughout the 1840s: The sculptor Ludwig Schwanthaler created a Goethe monument in 1844 and the unveiling ceremony, for example, became a rallying point for nationalists as did a meeting of German Studies scholars in Frankfurt's city hall, which, just before this meeting, had been decorated with images of all 52 emperors of the Holy Roman Empire created by artists such as Philipp Veit, Alfred Rethel and Eduard von Steinle. An umbrella organization of Frankfurt's democratic clubs, the Montagskränzchen (lit: "Monday clubs"), had been meeting since the winter of 1845/46.
In the early days of March 1848 the revolutionary spirit from France spilled over to Germany. Like everywhere else, the people of Frankfurt called for the rights of freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, constitutional equality for all citizens, amnesty for all those who had been imprisoned because of political activities and the right for every citizen to bear arms. On 3 March 1848, the senate of the city granted all rights except full emancipation of the Jews. The reformists who had met in the Montagskränzchen called for a reform of the city's constitution. All citizens were to elect the members of a constituent assembly for the city. This assembly was then to work out a new constitution to replace the laws which had been made as a mere addition to the old constitution.
On 9 March 1848 a flag in the colours of black, red and gold was first flown from the roof of the Palais Thurn und Taxis. On 31 March the so-called "pre-parliament" held a meeting in the Paulskirche, which had been converted from a church to a parliament building in a rush. The walls and windows of the church were decorated with flags in the colours of black, red and gold, the pulpit was covered in a cloth, and the organ was hidden by a big curtain, which featured a painting by Philipp Veit depicting Germania, holding a flag and a sword. The figure was framed on either side with laurel wreaths and patriotic verses. A table for the president was set up where the altar normally stood.

On 18 May 1848 the parliamentarians of the Frankfurt national assembly, among the first free voted German parliaments, congregated in the Paulskirche in a celebratory fashion. Friedrich Siegmund Jucho, a legal practitioner, was elected as the representative of the free city on 28 April. He was once a reporter for the National Assembly and affiliated with the left-centre parliamentary group, Westendhall, and later belonged to the so-called Erbkaiserliche, a political group led by Heinrich von Gagern.
With the increasing conservative reaction and endless parliamentary debates, the enthusiasm of the people of Frankfurt for the revolution disappeared.

The End of the Free City[edit]
After the break-up of the national assembly and the re-establishment of the German Confederation in 1850, the democratic opposition continued to advocate their demands, despite the senate's restorative politics that were considerate of the German princes. Nevertheless, the city's antiquated constitution was gradually reformed. In 1853, an electoral reform entitled the residents of the rural district to vote. By withdrawing the senators from courts and legislative meetings, the 1856 judicial and administrative reform established the separation of powers. Trials were henceforth held in public and verbal hearings and the elsewhere already common jury court was established.
The Prussian ambassador, Otto von Bismarck represented the interests of Prussia at the German Bundestag in Frankfurt from 1851 to 1859. The liberality of the Frankfurt middle class and the freedom of the press were much to his dislike. On 14 April 1853 he wrote to the Prussian foreign minister Otto Theodor von Manteuffel: "Regarding the democratic spirit and turmoils within the population of the city and its neighbouring regions... I am sure that we will only be able to successfully face these threats by subjecting this particular part of Germany to a military dictatorship, without any consideration of judicial norms or the preservation of these."
After years of conflict the remains of the medieval guild system finally disappeared in 1864. Economic freedom prevailed and even the last restrictions on the rights of Jewish citizens were abolished. In June 1866, right before losing its status as a free city, a direct majority voting system for all citizens was introduced to the legislative branch, instead of the previous electoral procedure which had been arranged according to profession. This new system still presumed citizenship, which meant having at least 5000 guilder. This new election law, however, was never used before Prussian annexation.
Because of the economic structure determined by trade and craft and because of the lack of economic freedom, there was no industrial proletariat in Frankfurt up until 1866. The first workers' association, founded in 1863, had only 67 members, of which 33 were tailors.
The Austro-Prussian rivalry was, by then, pushing Germany more and more towards war. Even the congress called by Austria, the Frankfurter Fürstentag, in August 1863 could not come up with a solution because of a Prussian boycott. As a result of the summit's failure, the Frankfurt public, which had long sympathised with Austria, was set completely against Prussia. The liberal Frankfurt Press was also predominantly anti-Prussian, especially the Frankfurt Ober-Postamts-Zeitung, founded in 1617, the Journal de Francfort, published in French, and the Handelszeitung, established in 1856. In the satirical magazine Frankfurt Lantern, first published in 1860, editor Friedrich Stoltze criticized Bismarck's policy in increasingly harsh commentaries and caricatures. This led to Prussia issuing a warrant for Stoltze's arrest so that he was not able to leave his home town.
However, in the sphere of the German National Association, founded in Frankfurt in 1859, there were also influential Frankfurters who believed in the "Prussian mission" to establish German unity. The movement's voice was the national-liberal Frankfurter Journal, which was subsidized by the Prussians. The Prussian consul general of Frankfurt was the highly respected banker Moritz von Bethmann, who had been one of the hosts of the Fürstentag. He later resigned his post in protest against Bismarck's policy.
When the German war inevitably loomed in the early summer of 1866, the town remained loyal to the German Confederation, according to its motto "faith in federal law". On 14 June 1866, they voted for the confederate execution against Prussia, though at the same time declaring that it would not participate in the civil war. Still, the town was not able to refrain from the entanglements of war, as Prussia regarded Frankfurt's loyalty to the Confederation as hostile. Bismarck was determined to violently establish German unity under Prussian rule and to oust Austria from German politics.

On 16 July 1866 the undefended city was occupied by the Prussian Army under their General Eduard Vogel von Falckenstein, who immediately imposed strict reprisals on the town. Only one day later, on 17 July, a first payment of 5.8 million guilder was imposed on the town.
Edwin Freiherr von Manteuffel, who was appointed as successor of Falckenstein on 20 July raised a second demand of contribution of 25 million guilder. This contribution had to be paid by the 35000 citizens of the free town, among whom approximately 8000 had to pay taxes. Numerous citizens, among them all members of the senate, were imposed with accommodations. The citizens had to provide their own saddle-horses for the army and the traders and landlords were forced to hand over large provisions, vine and cigars to the Prussian army command. Publishing was forbidden for all the newspapers of Frankfurt except for the journal. The editor of the newspaper of the main post office and privy councillor Fischer-Goullet was arrested and suffered a deadly stroke. The senators Bernus, Müller and Speltz were held hostage in the fortress of Cologne but were allowed to return to Frankfurt as a consequence of pledging their word of honour. Numerous citizens of Frankfurt escaped to foreign countries, like Friedrich Stoltze who escaped to Stuttgart and the natural scientist Eduard Rüppell, who escaped to Switzerland. In the end of 1866, the emigrants were allowed to return according to a general amnesty.

Territory[edit]
City map of Frankfurt in 1840
The Free City of Frankfurt was a state of its own. The state back then widely correlated to the borders of the city today. It spread on both riversides of the Main and remained mostly unchanged since the 15th century. The bordering states of Frankfurt were the Grand Duchy of Hesse to the South (Province of Starkenburg) and to the North (Province Upper Hesse), the Electorate of Hesse (District of Hanau) to the North and East, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg to the Northwest and the Duchy of Nassau to the West.
The territory of the Free City included the actual city of Frankfurt as the city district, eight villages that accounted to the rural district as well as the forest district.

Urban district[edit]
The urban district consisted mainly of the Altstadt or old city of the Staufer era and the Neustadt or inner city founded in the 14th century. Both were located within the city's fortification built at the beginning of the 19th century on the shore of the Main river.
It mostly consisted of the Staufer old town and the new town established in the 14th century. Both were situated within the former city's fortifications on the right waterside of the Main, which were established as ramparts at the beginning of the 19th century. Over 40000 inhabitants lived within an area of only approximately two square kilometres. This number advanced to 70000 inhabitants up until 1866. 5000 people, mostly craftsmen and bourgeois, were living in the also walled urban district Sachsenhausen on the left waterside of the Main.
The area lying within a 3–4-kilometre radius outside of the city walls was mostly used as agricultural space. Directly in front of the city were  gardens and vineyards. The outskirts along the present-day Alleenring, however, were cultivated in the old-fashioned style of Flurzwang, which took the basic principles of the crop rotation system, dating back to the Middle Ages. One part of the land was cultivated with spring crop, another part with winter crop, while the third part lay fallow. In between these parts lay small woodland areas and acres including the Knoblauchsfeld (garlic field) in the Nordend district, which was the source of the city's water supply. The construction of the water supply between 1827 and 1834 was one of the most important public projects of the Free City.

Forest District[edit]
Frankfurt's Forest District ranged over 22.123 morgen (4480 hectare). The City Forest, belonging to Frankfurt since 1372, was the most important part of the district. It was situated south of the River Main, stretching out over almost 40 square kilometers. The Riederwald, located south of Bornheim, as well as the exclave Hohemark in Taunus, which had been part of Nieder-Erlenbach, Bonames, Niederursel and Dortelweil, also belonged to the forest district. While the use of forests for pig fattening became less important, the wood harvest was one of the major economic factors. On Wäldchestag, the Tuesday following Whitsun, the majority of the citizens went to the forester's house in the city forest to celebrate Frankfurt's biggest folk festival.

Constitution and administration[edit]
School system[edit]
Until 1803 there had only existed one municipal school in Frankfurt, the Municipal grammar school which was founded in 1520 and which was reserved exclusively for sons of Lutheran citizens. Beside the grammar school there still existed nine "Quartierschulen" from the Middle Ages, these were private schools with municipal concession that could be bequeathed and sold. In general, every school had only one teacher. All teachers had united in a kind of guild. Since the school fees they levied were hardly enough to make a living, they often had to do additional work, e.g. the cutting of quills. As each of them had to take care of several hundred pupils, the quality of the education in the "Quartiersschulen" was expectably low.  The grammar school as well had a bad reputation in the 18th century, as the curriculum was completely outdated and the discipline of the pupils often led to complaints.
Since 1728 the supervision over all schools has lied with the Lutheran Consistory, a committee established by the City Council, consisting of secular and sacred members.  On the initiative of its chairmen Friedrich Maximilian Freiherrn von Günderrode and Wilhelm Friedrich Hufnagel, the dynamic senior of the Lutheran Preacher 's Ministry a comprehensive school reform was finally instigated in 1803.
In 1803 Hufnagel founded Frankfurt's first junior high, the Musterschule, based upon the pedagogical concept of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

Religious communities[edit]
Lutheran State Church[edit]
The Lutheran church formed since 1533 the state church, financially and administratively indissolvably intertwined with city budget and government. The Lutheran citizens and their siblings living within the city walls formed a uniform Lutheran congregation, while those Lutherans living in neighbouring villages in the countryside under city-state rule formed separate entities, administered by the city not by congregational bodies. All Lutheran churches within the walls were owned by the city and gratuitously used by the uniform congregation.
During the rule of Dalberg all Christian denominations were to be treated equally according to an 1806 revision of the constitution of the church. The supplementing file to the Frankfurt Constitution of 1816 said in article 35: Each Christian congregation and every other congregation, even though they have a right to be protected by the State, are subject to the supervision of the State and must not form a separate State within the State.
This supervision was arranged by the Senate of Frankfurt, which re-established the previously existing Lutheran consistory. According to Article 36, it was made up of two Lutheran senators, the Lutheran chief pastor (titled senior), two other Lutheran pastors and a jurist. With the exception of marital issues, which were taken over by the municipal court, the jurisdiction of the church continued to abide by the rules set forth in 1728. Article 37 left it up to the Reformed Church to establish a Consistory as well; this was then realised by ordinance of the Senate on 8 February 1820. 1820 there were six functioning Lutheran churches within the city proper with 12 pastors for about 28,000 Lutherans.
In 1830 the free city issued the deeds of dotation (Dotationsurkunden) fixing its long-lasting practice of owning and maintaining the church buildings in its old city centre (see so-called dotation churches; Dotationskirchen), but leaving their usage to congregations of the Lutheran state church or parishes of the Catholic church. The deeds of dotation statutorily established the eternal gratuitous usufruct of nine city-owned church buildings by six Lutheran congregations, and three church buildings by three Catholic parishes. A further fixed sum, later not altered any more and thus irrelevantly low today, is paid to contribute to the salaries of the clergy at these churches. Other religious groups, such as Jews and Reformed Protestants were not part of that government funding. The deeds of dotation are until today binding law in Frankfurt.
Unlike German area states Frankfurt's Lutheran state church had no parochial system territorially assigning parishioners to a particular church, but all Lutherans of Frankfurt formed a citywide community with one presbytery (Gemeindevorstand, comprising 36 elders), elected by the enfranchised parishioners, however, the voter turnout was always lower than 3% of the electorate. Only Frankfurt's five rural Lutheran congregations in Bonames, Bornheim, Hausen, Niederrad, Niederursel and Oberrad formed separate parishes. Since 1833 the executive board and the presbytery collaborated in appointing new pastors, forming permanent mixed bodies for this and other purposes since 1835.
On 5 February 1857 a new law separated religion and state, thus the Lutheran consistory did not include senators of the city government any more. Already in 1851 the civil marriage had made a religious wedding a mere option, chosen by about half the couples. The city-area was newly divided into six parishes, each assigned to one of the six Lutheran churches, the rural congregations now also received elected bodies. The new church constitution remained untouched by the Prussian annexing power in 1866, however, the church became supervised by the Prussian ministry of cult and education, ending the separation of religion and state again.
Since 1882 the consistorial president was appointed by the Prussian government. Despite the growing population in the 19th century the Lutheran church built the first additional church, Luther Church in Nordend, in 1892 only.
In 1899 the Lutheran and the Reformed churches of Frankfurt merged into a united administration called Konsistorialbezirk Frankfurt am Main (i.e. consistorial district of Frankfurt upon Main), with each congregation maintaining its preferred separate confession. The two consistories merged into one, now called royal consistory. Starting in 1906 church tax was levied from the church members. More congregations were founded since 1901 constructing their church buildings in the subsequent years.
With the Weimar Constitution religion and state were finally separated again on a nationwide scope. So the consistorial district convened a church assembly in 1921 which passed the new church constitution on 13 December 1923, assuming independence of the consistorial district and transforming it into Evangelische Landeskirche Frankfurt am Main (i.e. Protestant State Church of Frankfurt upon Main).
After the incorporation of more suburbs into the city boundary also eight united Protestant congregations of the Hesse-Casselian Protestant church body belonged to the city, but not to the Frankfurt regional church. In 1928 the Hesse-Casselian Protestant church body ceded these eight congregations and their parishes to the Frankfurt regional church body, which thus then comprised 19 Lutheran and eight united parishes, 2 Reformed congregations (German Reformed, Huguenot) and one Lutheran deaconesses congregation.
On 12 September 1933 the majority of the synod of the Frankfurt regional church voted for a merger with the regional church bodies of former Nassau and the regional church in the People's State of Hesse in order to form Evangelische Landeskirche in Hessen-Nassau (Protestant State Church in Hesse-Nassau). However, the usurpation of leading positions by Nazi-submissive clergy made the opponents of Nazism in the regional church doubt the legal validity of the merger. So the three church bodies reconstituted separately after the Second World War and their freely elected synods voted in the merger on 30 September 1947, establishing today's Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau.

Catholic Church[edit]
Since the Middle Ages, the Catholics of Frankfurt had belonged to the archbishopric of Mainz. With the adoption of Lutheran Reformation by the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt in 1533 the city unilaterally appropriated all ecclesiastical buildings within its boundary. This appropriation was protested by the emperor who – by the Augsburg Interim of 1548 –  regained all former collegiate churches, including their endowments of earning assets, for Catholic parishes, which the city thus had to tolerate within its boundary. The number of members, which had declined after the Lutheran Reformation to less than 100, increased anew over the years because of immigration. However, Catholics were excluded from the citizenship and any government office of the Free Imperial City, they only enjoyed unlimited staying permits.
In the course of the German Mediatisation the city finally secularised and appropriated the remaining Catholic endowments, however, leaving the usage to the existing Catholic parishes. Thus Lutherans and Catholics enjoyed gratuitous usufruct of church buildings owned and maintained by the city. Complete legal equality was achieved simultaneously with the end of the free imperial city (German: Freie Reichsstadt) and the Edict of Toleration, 1806.
Soon after the constitution of the Free City of Frankfurt the relations to Mainz were detached. In 1821 the Catholic Frankfurters became parishioners of the new Diocese of Limburg.

Jewish community[edit]
Further information: Frankfurter Judengasse
Jews living in Frankfurt since before the Reformation, were subject to high taxes, revocable residence permits, and many other restrictions. They were also excluded from citizenship and officialdom.
Jewish citizens of Frankfurt received full civil rights in 1864.

Reformed Church[edit]
Reformed Protestants from France and the Low Countries, in the 1550s reluctantly adopted in the free imperial city, were forbidden to profess their faith in 1561, but enjoyed unlimited staying permits, but not citizenship. A number of Reformed Frankfurters thus emigrated to the Palatinate where they founded the new city of Frankenthal in 1562. Others held Reformed ceremonies in their private homes.
By the 1590s more Reformed refugees were accepted in the city, but many emigrated later when they had found a better refuge. In 1601 the Reformed were allowed to maintain a chapel outside the city walls for their services, in return for allowing the Lutheran city council to veto their pastors. After that chapel had burnt down under unexplained circumstances in 1603, Reformed churchgoers could attend public Reformed service only abroad in the neighbouring Bockenheim, then County of Hanau.
After the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685, tens of thousands of Huguenots had to leave Catholic France. The city allowed them using Frankfurt as a transit stop, with 26,000 refugees passing, on their ways to other states allowing their immigration. Only in 1787 the Lutheran council allowed the construction of, modest though, Reformed churches within the city, without tower and bells.
In 1820 about 2,000 members of the two congregations, the German Reformed Church and the French Reformed Church, joined to form a separate Protestant Reformed Consistory. After the Amendment Acts to the Constitution had been passed the Churches were forced to fund all costs of their religious cult as according to the treaties without competing with the city-aerarii. Consequently, they had no share in the endowment (Dotation) of 1830. In 1899 the Reformed and the Lutheran churches of Frankfurt merged into a Protestant regional church body of united administration (Evangelische Kirches im Konsitorialbezirk Frankfurt am Main), with each congregation maintaining its chosen confession. The two consistories were merged too.

Foreign relations[edit]
The Free City of Frankfurt had diplomatic relationships with numerous European states as well as with the United States of America.
The states of Baden, Bavaria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Hanover, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, Sweden and Norway, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, the United States and Württemberg each had embassies and consulates in Frankfurt. The following states had a common delegation:

Hohenzollern, Liechtenstein, Waldeck-Pyrmont, Reuß, Schaumburg-Lippe and Lippe,
Mecklenburg,
Oldenburg, Anhalt and Schwarzburg, along with
the ducal and grand-ducal Saxon duchies.
Military[edit]
The voluntary citizens cavalry, German: freiwilliger Landsturm zu Pferde, was part of the Bürgerwehr, the citizens militia, founded in 1823. Historical Museum, Frankfurt
The military in the Free City of Frankfurt of which the city placed 579 men to the federal contingent, consisted of a 700-strong line battalion under the command of a lieutenant colonel. The line military consisted of mercenaries from southern Germany. Its six companies stayed in their barracks and guard rooms when Frankfurt was occupied on 16 July 1866. In the evening, the main guard passed on the line battalion to the Prussian Army with full military honors. Ten days later, on 26 July 1866, the battalion was dissolved after a last muster and the soldiers were released from duty. Depending on their term of service they received a gratuity between 50 and 250 guilders. Many of them let themselves be recruited by the French Foreign Legion afterwards.

Currency and measuring units[edit]
Currency[edit]
Frankfurter guilder coin minted in 1861
The most important currency in Frankfurt was the guilder (German: Gulden). It was a face-value coin whose mint price was defined as 24 guilders per Mark of silver since the Munich Coin Treaty of 1837. Therefore, one guilder contained 9.545 grams of pure silver.[1] The coins minted in Frankfurt featured the Eagle of Frankfurt on the one side and the label 1 Gulden (English: 1 guilder) with the year, surrounded by oak, on the other side. There were special issues, e.g. for Goethe's 100th birthday in 1849. On the edge of the coin, the text city's motto "Stark im Recht" was engraved.
The guilder was subdivided into 60 kreuzers. There were secondary coins worth one, three or six kreuzers as well as silver coins worth 12, 24 or 20 kreuzers. The Batzen was worth four kreuzers.

Reverse of the coin
This article or section appears to contradict itself. Please see the talk page for more information. (June 2015)
Starting in 1857, vereinsthalers were minted with a mint price of 14 thalers per mark of silver or 16.69 grams of silver.[2] Thus, 1.75 gulden were equal to  1 thaler. On the obverse, these coins featured the Francofurtia, an allegorical female figure designed by the sculptor August von Nordheim. Her model was supposed to be the actress Fanny Janauschek, on the one side. On the reverse, they showed the circular writing "Ein Vereinstaler – XXX ein Pfund fein". There were special issues of the thaler as well.
Due to the lack of a market basket, determining the exact buying power of the guilder is not possible. The pure silver value of the guilder would be about 3.65 euros. A comparison of buying powers based on data provided by the Hamburger Staatsarchiv and the Federal Statistical Office of Germany yielded a buying power of 16.50 euros in 1666.[3]

Sources: AFL Tables, AustralianFootball.com
Nathan Krakouer (born 5 May 1988) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the Port Adelaide Football Club and Gold Coast Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is the nephew of former North Melbourne football players Jimmy Krakouer and Phil Krakouer and cousin of former Richmond and Collingwood player Andrew Krakouer.


Early life[edit]
Krakouer began his junior football in Western Australia before playing senior football with the Claremont Football Club at a young age.
In 2006 he represented Australia's indigenous youth on tour to South Africa with the "Flying Boomerangs" to play against the South African national Australian rules team.[1]
He was invited to 2006 AFL Draft Camp where despite weighing just 61 kilograms he impressed scouts with both acceleration and standing jump for his height.

AFL career[edit]
Port Adelaide (2007–2010)[edit]
The slightly-built rookie teenager was recruited by AFL club Port Adelaide in the 2006 AFL Draft. He was the player the Power was most surprised to be able to pick when it grabbed him at number 39. Krakouer shone at the 2006 AFL Draft camp in Canberra, setting a sizzling time in the 20 metre sprint on the second day of the camp. His time of 2.83 seconds puts his result in the top handful of all time, out of nearly a thirty players over the last 12 or 13 years.[2]
Wearing the number 29 guernsey, he has played 11 games for Port in his debut 2007 AFL season, despite coach Mark Williams earlier predicting that he would not play for at least two years. As at the end of round 7, he had an impressive total of 48 kicks, 24 marks, 18 handballs, 66 disposals and 4 goals.[1]
His explosive speed and raw talent has been progressively emerging throughout the season. Notably, he played a crucial role in securing a win over North Melbourne in round 2, with a significant hand in three Port goals in 15 minutes; three such goals being in the last five minutes of the game. Krakouer was also the only Power player to take more than one inside-50 mark in Port's loss to the Crows in Showdown XXII.
At the end of round 7, Krakouer was ranked sixth among the AFL Rising Stars in total kicks and total marks, and seventh in total goals.[3]
In 2008, Krakouer managed just three games for the Power due to recurring soft tissue injuries, and was granted permission by the club to return home to Western Australia after suffering a season-ending hamstring strain in round 15. This led to speculation that Krakouer would seek a potential trade to the Fremantle Football Club or West Coast Eagles, two West Australian based clubs. However this never happened, with Krakouer stating: "I had a talk to Choco (Williams) and I just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t tell him I wanted to go back. I felt like I couldn’t just walk out and I’m glad I didn’t."[4]
In 2009, an improvement in fitness and bulk in Krakouer saw him move to the backlines playing as a "sweeper role" and essentially replacing Peter Burgoyne who returned to his original position as a midfielder. Krakouer played well in this role, averaging over 20 possessions in the 2009 NAB Cup, and being named in the Power's round 1 game of the season.
Season 2010 was forgetful for Krakouer as he was limited to just seven games due to injuries and lack of form.

Gold Coast (2011)[edit]
On 1 September 2010, Krakouer signed a three-year deal with the Gold Coast Suns. He was the second uncontracted player to do so following Nathan Bock who left Adelaide. He left despite the disappointment of Port Adelaide who stated that given the commitment our football club has made to Nathan's development and welfare over the last four years, we are very disappointed at the way the matter has been handled in recent weeks. It was alluded to that Krakouer had already made the decision to leave Port Adelaide during the season, further highlighting criticism of the AFL's clause for the expansion teams ability recruit one uncontracted player from each of the 16 existing clubs.[5]
In December 2011, Krakouer was released by the Suns due to "personal reasons" despite being contracted to the end of the 2012 season.[6]

Return to Port Adelaide (2015–2017)[edit]
On 31 March, Krakouer was signed to play for the Port Adelaide Magpies in hope to re-ignite his AFL career.[7] He polled best and fairest votes in 12 of his 16 games,[8] and was subsequently drafted as a rookie by Port Adelaide's AFL side.
Starting on the rookie list in 2015, he impressed in the pre-season trial matches and was quickly promoted from the rookie list to play his first AFL game for the Power since 2010 in round 3 as his accurate kicking and smooth movement off the half back line proved to be valuable. He played 7 games before being returned to the rookie list. He was immediately reinstated to the senior list as a mid season promotion and went on to play another 7 games for a return of 14 on the season.
At the conclusion of the 2017 season, Krakouer announced his retirement from AFL football.[9]

Newell Boathouse, named for a popular Harvard athlete killed just a few years after graduation, is the primary boathouse used by Harvard University's varsity men's rowing teams.[1] It stands on land subject to an unusual peppercorn lease agreement between Harvard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.[2][3]


History[edit]
Called "the elder statesman among Charles River boathouses,"[4] Newell Boathouse is named for 1894 Harvard College graduate Marshall Newell, a varsity rower and All-American football player in all four of his undergraduate years, "beloved by all those who knew him" and nicknamed "Ma" for the guidance he gave younger athletes.[5] After Newell was killed in 1897,[6] $2,000 was raised for a boathouse in his memory.[5]
Built in 1900 on the south side of the Charles to a design by Peabody and Stearns (architect Robert Peabody having been rowing captain as a Harvard undergraduate),[1] Newell Boathouse is constructed of concrete, with a slate façade and roof. It was Harvard's first permanent boathouse,[7] replacing a series of wooden boathouses in the area.[8] In addition to storage for racing shells, the building provides locker rooms, meeting and training rooms, and rowing tanks and other practice equipment.[4] Architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting wrote that its "complex profile ... closely resembling that of Carey Cage reflected in the Charles in the early morning, has made it a landmark on the river."[7]

Site lease[edit]
The "prime riverfront space" upon which Newell Boathouse stands belongs to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In addition to having given the Commonwealth forty-six acres of land downriver, Harvard pays $1 per year for the right to maintain a boathouse on the site, under a lease running one thousand years, at the end of which time Harvard has the option to renew the lease for a further thousand years[3]‍—‌an example of a peppercorn lease amounting to "virtual freehold."[2]

After capturing the legs with his arms and legs he begins rolling over to land on the mat.
The spladle is a wrestling technique commonly used as a counter and pinning move to single leg take downs. When opponents shoot in and grab the leg the wrestler will drop their weight on the opponents head to prevent advancement of the take down, from there they may reach across the body with their arms to grab hold of the opponents far side leg, once completed they wrap the near side leg with the leg targeted for the take down and roll forward onto the mat. When on the floor it is important to control both legs of the opponent as the wrestler wants to bring the knees of his opponent as close to inline with the opponent's head as possible.[1][2]
As a pin that is the result of countering a take down, this is a very effective technique to use when possible in order to score, however the position in which the two wrestlers land can breed controversy as to who the points will go to. While the wrestler caught in the spladle is certainly unable to effectively do anything, let alone escape, the one who uses it in some cases may have their shoulders flat to the mat as well which could result in them being judged as the one being pinned in some cases. This is caused because it is likely that their shoulder rolled onto the mat first, to determine this the referee would need to reflect on the match he witnessed or review any tape there is if it is available for viewing in order to determine the victor.


Variations[edit]
Counter: This technique is very often used as a counter-style move a variety of the single leg take downs (typically not high crotch unless it is possible to bring down to a manageable position the one attempting said take down) by reaching across the back and getting a hold of both legs as described at the top of the article. While this is the most used variation and the one most commonly seen in competition or demonstration purposes it is not the only way of using this technique.
Offensive: From certain positions on the mat the opponent may wrap a leg from where there are positions in which one may catch the spladle, typically when the wrestler on the bottom is attempting to reverse positions by attacking a leg with hopes of executing something similar to a single leg style take down, ankle pick or reversal technique involving the wrapping or control of a singular leg. With this sort of style to the spladle where the wrestler on top is working for a pin while the other stalls him or is not sure what to do, there are many possibilities present in order to work towards this pin.[3]
Double pinning[edit]
As previously stated in this article, the way by which the wrestlers fall and how they end up on the mat, in the end, can create confusion as to who will win. This is caused by both competitors landing with their shoulders flat on the mat, this is known as a double pin, while not very common of an occurrence they still can happen and result in the point being awarded to the dominant wrestler or the one being pinned based on what happened in the movements and moments leading up to it. Should the wrestler, who is placing the other in the hold, if his shoulders land flat on the mat first he will be the one deemed as pinned, and should the wrestler placed in the pin have his shoulders land flat first then he will be judged to be the one pinned. In order to avoid this situation, it is necessary to, once holding the pin, attempt to ensure that the shoulders stay at minimum 20 degrees off the mat.

Uses outside of wrestling[edit]
This technique has uses as a submission as well as a pin, because of the high amount of possible strain placed on the back and hamstrings this hold has a high potential for leading a competitor to quit because of the pain, leading to the submission victory in sports like mixed martial arts, submission wrestling and other grappling sports designed for submission. The effectiveness of this pin as a submission is comparable to the "twister" in the way it places a lot of force on one's spine leading to a lot of pain. Another submission and pin it is similar to it the "electric chair" or "banana split" in that it forces the legs of the one captured in it apart, forward or back in such a way it puts a lot of tension on the hamstring, quad and crotch muscles in the legs which could result in the tearing of said muscles if the competitors and referee are not careful to stop or hold the submission (pin) so no further tension is placed on the legs.

The Empty Copper Sea (1978) is the 17th novel in the Travis McGee series by John D. MacDonald. In it, McGee looks into the apparent drowning of Hub Lawless in a boating accident. His $2 million insurance policy leads some to believe he has faked his death.
The title of the book is taken from a passage in Chapter 13 (on page 218 of the first printing of the hardcover edition).  The sentence reads "I turned my head and saw, beyond the shoulder of my beloved, the empty copper sea, hushed and waiting, as if the world had paused between breaths."
The novel was adapted as the television movie Travis McGee (1983), starring Sam Elliott. The film abandoned the Florida locales in favor of California.

Plot summary[edit]
A wealthy landowner/investor named Hub Lawless has disappeared off the west coast of Florida, supposedly fallen overboard during a storm and drowned. The captain of the boat, Van Harder, is blamed, having been found drunk and passed out when the boat returned to shore, but all is not as it appears and the dead man possibly faked his own death and is, instead, living in Mexico with a lover, avoiding the eventual failure of his businesses.
Harder comes to McGee, asking him to salvage his reputation as a boat captain. He has placed a value of $20,000 on his "good name" and has offered $10,000 to McGee in payments over time to find out the truth of what happened. McGee and Meyer travel to the Gulf Coast of Florida, undercover as investors, to find out the truth of what happened. Over the course of the investigation, McGee meets Gretel, who features prominently in the next book, The Green Ripper.

External videos You may watch the premier televised broadcast of Gian Carlo Menotti's opera Amahl and the Night Visitors in 1951 here
Amahl and the Night Visitors is an opera in one act by Gian Carlo Menotti with an original English libretto by the composer.[1] It was commissioned by NBC and first performed by the NBC Opera Theatre on December 24, 1951, in New York City at NBC Studio 8H in Rockefeller Center, where it was broadcast live on television from that venue as the debut production of the Hallmark Hall of Fame. It was the first opera specifically composed for television in the United States.[2]


Composition history[edit]
Menotti was commissioned by Peter Herman Adler, director of NBC's new opera programming, to write the first opera for television. The composer had trouble settling on a subject for the opera, but took his inspiration from Hieronymus Bosch's The Adoration of the Magi hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.
As the airdate neared, Menotti had yet to finish the score. The singers had little time to rehearse, and received the final passages of the score just days before the broadcast. The composer's partner Samuel Barber was brought in to complete the orchestrations.[3] After the dress rehearsal, NBC Symphony conductor Arturo Toscanini told Menotti, "This is the best you've ever done."[4]
Menotti distinctly wanted Amahl to be performed by a boy. In the "Production Notes" contained in the piano-vocal score he wrote: "It is the express wish of the composer that the role of Amahl should always be performed by a boy. Neither the musical nor the dramatic concept of the opera permits the substitution of a woman costumed as a child."[1]

Genesis[edit]
Menotti was inspired by the painting The Adoration of the Magi by Hieronymus Bosch.
The booklet with the original cast recording contains the following anecdote:

This is an opera for children because it tries to recapture my own childhood. You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children to be able to handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.
I actually never met the Three Kings—it didn't matter how hard my little brother and I tried to keep awake at night to catch a glimpse of the Three Royal Visitors, we would always fall asleep just before they arrived. But I do remember hearing them. I remember the weird cadence of their song in the dark distance; I remember the brittle sound of the camel's hooves crushing the frozen snow; and I remember the mysterious tinkling of their silver bridles.
My favorite king was King Melchior, because he was the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. I suspect it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.
To these Three Kings I mainly owe the happy Christmas seasons of my childhood and I should have remained very grateful to them. Instead, I came to America and soon forgot all about them, for here at Christmas time one sees so many Santa Clauses scattered all over town. Then there is the big Christmas tree in Rockefeller Plaza, the elaborate toy windows on Fifth Avenue, the one-hundred-voice choir in Grand Central Station, the innumerable Christmas carols on radio and television—and all these things made me forget the three dear old Kings of my old childhood.
But in 1951 I found myself in serious difficulty. I had been commissioned by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to stop in front of the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had brought me a gift.
I am often asked how I went about writing an opera for television, and what are the specific problems that I had to face in planning a work for such a medium. I must confess that in writing  "Amahl and the Night Visitors," I hardly thought of television at all. As a matter of fact, all my operas are originally conceived for an ideal stage which has no equivalent in reality, and I believe that such is the case with most dramatic authors. —Gian-Carlo Menotti[5]


Premiere[edit]
Menotti wrote Amahl with the stage in mind, even though it was intended for broadcast. "On television you're lucky if they ever repeat anything. Writing an opera is a big effort and to give it away for one performance is stupid."[2] The composer appeared on-screen in the premiere to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought out director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers to thank them on-screen.[6]
Amahl was seen on 35 NBC affiliates coast to coast, the largest network hookup for an opera broadcast to that date. An estimated five million people saw the live broadcast, the largest audience ever to see a televised opera.[7]

Performance history[edit]
1951–1962[edit]
For its first three telecasts, the program had been presented in black-and-white (there were two presentations of it in 1952, one on Easter and one during the Christmas season),[8] but beginning in 1953, it was telecast in color.[9] Because it was an opera, and commercial network television executives had increasingly little confidence in presenting opera on television, it later began to be scheduled, with rare exceptions, as an afternoon television program, rather than shown in prime time as had been done in its first few telecasts.[10] According to The New Kobbe's Complete Opera Book, the first stage performance was presented at Indiana University Bloomington, on February 21, 1952,[11] with conductor Ernest Hoffman. The opera's second performance was in Boston on December 18 and 19, 1952. It was presented by the Opera Club at the Agassiz Theatre of Radcliffe College, under the direction of Thomas H. Phillips for the Longy School of Music. James Hercules Sutton, 9, soloist for Alfred Nash Patterson at the Church of the Advent, played Amahl; Claire Smith played the mother; Walter Lambert, Paul Johnson and Hermann Gantt played the three kings.

1963–1966[edit]
Willis Patterson, John McCollum, Richard Cross as the Three Kings, with Kurt Yaghjian as Amahl and Martha King as his mother in the 1963 production
For years, Amahl was presented live, but in 1963 it was videotaped by NBC with conductor Herbert Grossman and an all-new cast featuring Kurt Yaghjian as Amahl, Martha King as the Mother, and John McCollum, Willis Patterson, and Richard Cross as the Three Kings. This was the first television production of "Amahl" in which the role of King Balthazar was sung by a real African-American. Earlier productions, including the 1951 original version, had had a white man in blackface singing the role. When Menotti found out that NBC had scheduled the taping on a date when he was out of the country, he tried to get the date changed. The network refused and recorded the 1963 performance without the composer's presence or participation, telecasting it in December 1963, and twice more after that — in 1964 and 1965. Menotti never approved of the 1963 production, and in May 1966 when the rights to future broadcasts reverted to him, the composer refused to allow it to be shown again.[12] Because of this, Amahl was not shown on television at all between 1966 and 1978.

1978[edit]
In 1978, a new production starring Teresa Stratas as Amahl's mother, Robert Sapolsky as Amahl, and Willard White, Giorgio Tozzi and Nico Castel as the Three Kings was filmed by NBC, partly on location in the Holy Land. As was the norm for filmed opera, the music was pre-recorded and the singers mimed their performances to the playback.[12] It did not, however, become an annual tradition the way the 1951 and 1963 versions had.

BBC productions[edit]
The BBC made several productions of Amahl and the Night Visitors in the 1950s. The first performance was broadcast on December 20, 1953, with Charles Vignoles as Amahl, and Gladys Whitred as his mother. The Three Kings were sung by John Lewis (Kaspar), Scott Joynt (Balthasar), and John Cameron (Melchior). Edric Connor was the Page and Josephine Gordon was the dancer. The opera was produced by Christian Simpson and the conductor was Stanford Robinson.[13]
This performance was so successful that it was repeated on Christmas Eve 1954 with substantially the same cast apart from the Page sung by John Carvalho and the dancer, Betty Ferrier.[14] 
Both performances were broadcast live. A telerecording of the 1954 performance was broadcast on Christmas Eve 1956 but this recording seems to have been discarded.
An audio recording of the 1954 performance exists in private hands.[citation needed]
Further performances followed in subsequent years.[citation needed][15] The 1955 performance was also produced by Christian Simpson, starring Malcolm Day as Amahl, with Gladys Whitred as Amahl's mother. Music was provided by the Sinfonia of London. It appears that this performance was also broadcast live. It was either not recorded or the recording was discarded. It does not exist in the BBC Archives. 
The second production was broadcast on December 24, 1959. This version exists as a 35 mm telerecording in the BBC Archives. This version was again produced by Christian Simpson and starred Christopher Nicholls as Amahl and Elsie Morison as Amahl's mother. This time music was provided by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

1957 Australian TV version[edit]
A version was broadcast on ABC on Australian television in 1957. It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was kinescoped to be shown in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the kinescope recording still exists.[citation needed]

Shepherds and Villagers


Synopsis[edit]
Place: Near Bethlehem.
Time: The first century, just after the birth of Christ
Amahl, a disabled boy who can walk only with a crutch, has a problem with telling tall tales. He is sitting outside playing his shepherd's pipe when his mother calls for him ("Amahl! Amahl!"). After much persuasion, he enters the house but his mother does not believe him when he tells her there is an amazing star "as big as a window" outside over their roof ("O Mother You Should Go Out and See"; "Stop Bothering Me!").
Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, praying that Amahl not become a beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), there is a knock at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is "a cold fireplace and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You a Real King?"; "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, I Told You Not to Be a Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying "They kept asking me questions," when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; "Emily! Emily"; "Olives and Quinces"; "Dance of the Shepherds").
After the neighbors have left and the kings are resting, the mother attempts to steal for her son some of the kings' gold that was meant for the Christ Child ("All That Gold"). She is thwarted by the kings' page ("Thief! Thief!"). When Amahl wakes to find the page grabbing his mother, he attacks him ("Don't You Dare!"). Seeing Amahl's defense of his mother and understanding the motives for the attempted theft, King Melchior says she may keep the gold as the Holy Child will not need earthly power or wealth to build his kingdom ("Oh, Woman, You Can Keep That Gold"). The mother says she has waited all her life for such a king and asks the kings to take back the gold. She wishes to send a gift but has nothing to send. Amahl, too, has nothing to give the Child except his crutch ("Oh, No, Wait"). When he offers it to the kings, his leg is miraculously healed ("I Walk, Mother"). With permission from his mother, he leaves with the kings to see the Child and give his crutch in thanks for being healed.

Recordings[edit]
For several years it was assumed that the film (kinescope) of the original telecast had been lost, but a copy was found, transferred to video, and is now available at The Paley Center for Media (formerly The Museum of Television & Radio) and online at the Museum of Broadcast Communications.[16]
The original 1951 telecast has never been rebroadcast, although bootleg recordings have been made. A kinescope of the 1955 broadcast starring Bill McIver as Amahl was digitized in 2007 and is available commercially on DVD. The 1955 and 1978 productions are the only ones released on video. Cast recordings of both the 1951 and the 1963 productions were released on LP by RCA Victor, and the 1951 cast recording was reissued on compact disc in 1987. The 1963 recording of Amahl was the first recording of the opera made in stereo.

Legacy[edit]
Amahl and the Night Visitors was the first network television Christmas special to become an annual tradition. There had already been several television productions of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol since about 1947, but they had not been shown annually or presented by the same television network, with the same general technical staff, as Amahl was. Until 1963, Amahl was nearly always presented with many of the same singers and production staff.[17] From 1951 until 1966 it was presented every year on NBC (which commissioned Menotti to write it) on or around Christmas Eve, as an episode of an existing anthology series, such as The Alcoa Hour,[18] NBC Television Opera,[19] or the Hallmark Hall of Fame.[20] The 1978 production of Amahl also premiered on NBC, before it went to cable television in the early 1980s.
A film based on Amahl,  Amahl and the Night Visitors, was made in Britain in 1996 by Christine Edzard.

Qingyang sachet, also known as "chu chu" or "shua huo" (hidden stitch) is a folk custom of Qingyang, Gansu, China. Sachets are created from small pieces of silk, which are embroidered with colorful strings in a variety of patterns according to papercutting designs. The silk is then sewn into different shapes and filled with cotton and spices. Qingyang sachets symbolize blessing, auspiciousness, happiness, safety, peace, and avoidance of evil, disaster, illnesses, and misfortune.[1] Many sachets are also filled with cinnabar, calamus, wormwood, and chrysanthemum, and they are commonly used as air fresheners, insect repellent, and protection against evil spirits.[2]


History[edit]
Historically sachet has also gone by the names of purse, "xiangnang," "peiwei," and "rongchou". In Qingyang, however, it is commonly known as "chu chu" or "shua huo" "Chu" originally referred to the original method of using bone needles for sewing, but later referred to the sachet itself, which is made of cloth. In local Qingyang culture, it may also be called purse or “shua huo zi.”[1]
Historians differ on the exact origins of the sachet. One account dates it around 2300 BC. Another accredits the sachet to the mythological doctor Qibo and to a passage in the Huangdi Neijing, which has been dated between the late Warring States period (475-221 BCE) and the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE).[1][3] More rooted in tangible history, the sachet appeared in the Warring States period as distinctive decorations worn as a clothing accessory as well as mosquito repellent. The origins of the “fragrant sachet” has been assigned to rural Chinese women during the Han dynasty. During this time, an account appeared in the Book of Rites, compiled by Dai Sheng, which described the popularity of perfumed and embroidered brocade sachets, especially among young people who wore these sachets around their wrists, necks, and waists. They were also popular in the Tang (618-906) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, but were mainly luxuries for the wealthy and powerful. Qingyang’s male officials and women from elite families wore sachets filled with traditional Chinese medicine rather than perfume. Sachets would later be used as tokens of love and affection in the Qing dynasty (1644-1661).[4]
The oldest existing sachet is approximately 800 years old. In 2001 people excavated stone pagodas from the Song dynasty in Qingyang. They found a sachet embroidered with plums and lotus flowers, its pattern still clear despite the passage of time. Thus the sachet earned the name “Longevity Sachet.”[1][4]
In 2002, China Folklore Society named Qingyang City "the Hometown of Embroidery Sachets." In 2006, China's State Council included Qingyang sachets in the first official batch of "National Intangible Cultural Heritage," promoting the sachets as the cultural brand of foreign exchange of Qingyang City.[5]
Today the sachet is seen most commonly at the Dragon Boat Festival, in which the making and wearing of "chu chu" is a local custom. Festival goers and locals use sachets filled with herbal medicine to pray for their health while many children wear them in hopes of increasing their intelligence, peace, and health.
Many popular mainstream sachets are created by Qingyang Lingyun Clothing Co., Ltd., with Zhang Zhifeng as chairperson, who is an inheritor of sachet-making. The company employs 200 people and creates 40 million yuan worth of clothing and sachets annually. The company purchases sachets from rural women, processes them, and then resells the sachets to the public.[4][6]

Types[edit]
There are four main ways to construct a sachet, involving unique needlework, attaching accessories, and the sachet's overall shape:[1]

Chu chu: This sachet entails hiding the needles while embroidering, thus creating a sachet without visible stitching.
Spool: This sachet is made with many colors and is designed in the shape of Zongzi (a pyramid-shaped mass of glutinous rice wrapped in leaves).
3D: These sachets can be complicated, with accessories dangling from one or all sides of the sachet. There are up to 400 formats of the 3D sachet.
Plain embroidery: This sachet is simple, focusing mainly on the embroidery itself than the sachet's construction.
Common symbols and patterns[edit]
Qingyang sachets often exhibit repeated symbols and patterns, reflecting Qingyang's past and present traditions, beliefs, and religion. Sachets are typically embroidered with flora and fauna.[citation needed] Since ancient times, Qingyang’s dominant philosophical strongholds have been Confucianism and Taoism, and their various tenants appear symbolically and thematically in the designs of sachets. Important Confucianist ideals are filial piety, strength-borrowing (achieving one’s objectives through the strength of others), the Five Bonds (ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, and friend to friend), and the doctrine of the “mean” and “neutralization” (being impartial and in harmonious portion while dealing with the everyday). Taoism, on the other hand, places emphasis on quietism, effortless action, and immortality. The main philosophy that emerges from these two traditions is that man is an integral part of nature and should therefore follow natural laws, which dominates the symbolism adorning Qingyang sachets. In addition, many symbols retain Buddhist ideals also circulated in the region, such as the golden fish and swastika.[1][5]
Sachets typically consist of one of four patterns: shape-oriented, meaning-oriented, homophone-oriented, and heterogeneous patterns. Shared-oriented patterns include patterns that have shared-shapes (shapes intertwined or side-by-side), shape(s)-inside-shape(s) (an image within an image), and combined-shapes (two images melded together, typically an animal and a human). Shape-oriented patterns use easily recognizable images from local traditions to convey a story or idea. Meaning-oriented patterns convey a specific meaning and thus a specific purpose, such as praying for one's sons. Homophone-oriented patterns display various images, which represent words that share similar pronunciations as homophones. This allows for word play. Heterogeneous patterns consist of varying images and symbols versus a limited set of only few, as seen in the other three patterns.[5]
Researchers and sachet artisans have compiled a various symbols and patterns common to Qingyang sachets, many of which are cataloged below.

Bagua: This image derives from Taoist cosmology, consisting of combinations of three whole or broken lines.[5]
"Boy-fish": This pattern is one of combined-shapes, featuring the head of boy melded with the body of fish. The use of animals to express human desires and aspirations most likely derives from totem worship in ancient China. The boy-fish represents the ancient Chinese worship of the abilities of fish, including prolificacy and swimming. Improving oneself with the abilities of other animals is in line with the Confucian ideal of "being good at making use of materials," and the combination of fish and human represents the Confucian value of "harmony between man and nature."[5]
Cranes under pine trees: This pattern symbolizes longevity, a Taoist ideal.[4]
Dragon and phoenix: This auspicious pattern depicts both dragons and phoenixes, representing prosperity and good luck.[4]
Fish: The totem of the Pre Zhou dynasty, originating from North Bin. A single fish can also represent a penis while double fish may represent vulvae, thus also signifying the worship of Nüwa, the Chinese goddess of creation. Fish may also represent maternity and ancient fertility worship.[5]
"Fish-lotus-boy": A typical image used to express love, the fish-lotus-boy depicts procreation with a fish swimming through a lotus flower. The fish represents the male while the lotus represents the female, with a depiction of a boy who has been created through this process. This image indirectly expresses the desire for male offspring as well as "filial piety."[5]
Frog: The frog signifies continuing matrilineal worship and the worship of Nüwa. Because the Chinese symbol for frog has similar pronunciation as the Chinese symbol for baby, frogs also appear in sachets that are blessings for a newborn.[5]
Golden fish: This image originates in Buddhist culture, typically appearing as a pair of golden fishes. It is one of the eight auspicious symbols or Ashtamangala. It represents happiness, impulsiveness, fertility, profusion, freedom, conjugal harmony, and loyalty. Buddhist culture.[5][7]
Heart, gold ingot, and butterfly: These images typically appear on brightly-colored sachets, which result from and symbolize a woman's wisdom.[4]
"Immortals-turtles-peach": This pattern is typical of sachets used to pray for longevity. The traditional Chinese character for longevity (壽) is placed in the center with two turtles each carrying four immortals placed symmetrically around the character. Atop the character is a peach. The image of the Eight Immortals invokes ancient Chinese idol worship and prayer for immortal life. Both turtles and peaches are metaphors for longevity in Taoist fairytales. These images represent the Taoist ideal of "Nourishing of life."[5]
"Lotus-boy": A combination of a lotus and a virgin boy, this image is typical of those conveying praying for sons. It represents the desire for offspring, per the Confucian saying of “having no male heir is the gravest of the three cardinal offenses against filial piety.” Lotuses also have many seeds (“籽”in Chinese). The character 籽 (seed) is pronounced “zi," which has the same pronunciation as "son" (子). Because males inherit property in a patriarchal clan system, praying for one's sons over one's daughters embodies the patriarchal local folk cultural ideals of “valuing the male child only” and “carrying on the family line.” In addition, "lotus" (莲), pronounced as "lian,"has a similar pronunciation as "one after the other" (连), meaning praying for honorable sons one after the other.[5]
Lotus flower: This Buddhist image represents the universe. A white lotus signifies purity while a yellow lotus denotes spiritual ascension. A lotus may also represent vulvae.[5][8]
Mandarin ducks playing on water: This pattern symbolizes a devoted couple living in peace and harmony.[4]
"Rooster-fish-maize": This pattern includes two roosters, two fish, and two pieces of maize cobs, a type homophone-oriented pattern. "Rooster" (鸡) is pronounced as "ji"similar to 吉 (auspicious omen). "Fish" (鱼) and "maize" (玉米) are both pronounced "yu," similar to 余 (affluence). These homophones refer to the desire for auspicious and a prosperous life, including a good harvest with a grain surplus and a higher social status, in line with the Confucian ideal of "engaged in social life."[5]
"Six-happy-babies": This is a typical shared-shaped pattern, formed by two baby girls and a baby boy joined by their arms, legs, and torsos. This represents the wish for more offspring and is consistent with the Confucian ideal of harmony.[5]
Snake: An image representing continuing matrilineal worship and the worship of Nüwa.[5]
Swastika: An image from Buddhism, used to represent auspiciousness.[5]
Taijitu: An image from Chinese philosophy, used to represent auspiciousness.[5]
Tiger: A totem of “the Western toad family”, the original inhabitants of Qingyang district. Tigers also signify subduing and warding off evil spirits, accounting for their popularity.[5]
"Tweeted-totter-snakes": This shape-inside-shape pattern depicts a tortoise in the middle of two snakes. This image signifies the Confucian doctrine of "Mean" and neutralization as well as the theme of "seeking longevity" in Chinese culture. The snakes and tortoise also represent Confucian "harmony" and the "power of team" while the distinction between the primary (the tortoise, the center of the pattern) and the secondary (the snakes) represents Confucian "hierarchy."[5]

Aloe maculata (syn. Aloe saponaria), the soap aloe or zebra aloe, is a Southern African species of aloe. Local people in South Africa know it informally as the Bontaalwyn in Afrikaans, or lekhala in the Sesotho language.[1]


Description[edit]
It is a very variable species and hybridizes easily with other similar aloes, sometimes making it difficult to identify. The leaves range in colour from red to green, but always have distinctive "H-shaped" spots. 
The flowers are similarly variable in colour, ranging from bright red to yellow, but are always bunched in a distinctively flat-topped raceme. The inflorescence is borne on the top of a tall, multi-branched stalk and the seeds are reputedly poisonous.

Taxonomy[edit]
This species was previously known as Aloe saponaria (a name that came from the Latin "sapo" meaning soap, as the sap makes a soapy lather in water). Its currently accepted name, according to the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), is Aloe maculata ("maculata" means speckled or marked).
Taxonomically, it forms part of the Saponariae series of very closely related Aloe species, together with Aloe petrophila, Aloe umfoloziensis, Aloe greatheadii and Aloe davyana.[2]

Distribution[edit]
The soap aloe is highly adaptable and is naturally found in a wide range of habitats across Southern Africa, from Zimbabwe in the north, to the Cape Peninsula in the south. Specifically, it is native to southern and eastern South Africa, south-eastern Botswana and Zimbabwe.
In addition, it is now planted around the world as a popular landscape plant in warm desert regions – especially in the United States, where it is the most popular ornamental aloe in the Tucson, Arizona area, and is also popular in California.

Uses[edit]
This plant gel is used traditionally as a remedy for many medicinal properties by local people like: Skin complains, inflammation, respiratory system, muscular-skeletal system, poisoning, circulation and endocrine system diseases.[3]

Cultivation[edit]
Plants are damaged by temperatures below 32 °F (0 °C), but recover quickly. In a suitable climate, soap aloes require little attention once established.[4] Aloe maculata is very salt tolerant — a good choice for seaside gardens.[5]
A hybrid between A. maculata and A. striata is very popular in the gardening trade and is used for water-wise landscaping worldwide. Aloe maculata (and some of its many hybrids) are low-growing and propagate by suckers. If permitted, they form a useful ground cover in arid regions. Its spotted leaves are attractive even when the plants are not in flower, but the flowers produce a fine show for several weeks in summer. Pollinators, both birds and insects, visit the flowers avidly for nectar and pollen.[citation needed]




The distinctive flat-topped flower-heads of Aloe maculata are one of the surest ways of identifying this plant.

The Johannesburg Regiment[1] is an infantry regiment of the South African Army. As a reserve unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit.


History[edit]
Origins as Artillery[edit]
Johannesburg Regiment has been in existence since 1 July 1951. At the time it was an Artillery unit known as 8 Field Regiment South African Artillery. Colonel J. S. K. Brink was the Regiment's first commanding officer and following his retirement he became its honorary colonel. The Regiment's Headquarters were originally based at Auckland Park, where the current SABC offices are situated.

Re-mustered to Infantry[edit]
In February 1960, 8 Field Regiment disbanded and the unit officially became known as Johannesburg Regiment and was re mustered as an Infantry Regiment.

Regiment colours[edit]
In May 1962 the Johannesburg Municipality agreed that the Regiment could use the Municipal Coat of Arms as their Unit Emblem. Some minor changes were however done to the coat of arms, namely, the two sable antelope that acted as the supporters being replaced with two F.N. Rifles to give it a military touch. With this, the Regiment made history by being the first unit that used an F.N. Rifle in its armorial bearings. A badge that consists only of the shield, was also included.
The motto is on a braid in Latin wording “Fortiter Et Recte” which means “With Valour and Justice”.
The official Colour presentation parade was held at the Milnerpark Showgrounds stadium on 26 February 1966.

Operations[edit]
The Regiment mobilised for the first time in 1960 and saw initial service in Bloemfontein, Vereeniging and Sasolburg.
The Johannesburg Regiment has been actively involved in continuous and operational service since its founding in 1960. 

Converted to Mechanised Infantry[edit]
The Regiment achieved a pinnacle in its history, becoming one of the first then citizen force units to be converted from a motorized to a mechanized unit in 1980 – the achievement occurred as the Regiment was voted the best unit in 72 Brigade on various evaluations during the year.SADF era Johannesburg Regiment Outstanding Service badge with the ratel insignia denoting a mechanised unit (See 1 SAI emblems)

Subsequent successes include amongst others the following operations/ exercises:
Madimbo, Savannah, Caterpillar, Protea, Thunder Chariot, Ops Eardrum, Ops Paal, Excalibur 1&2, Eagle Hill, Kwiksilwer, Vincity and Southern Cross.

Peace keeping[edit]
The Regiment has also successfully participated in peace operations in Africa.
In 2005 Johannesburg Regiment again made history when it provided troops for the first Reserve Company to be deployed in Peace Support Operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Freedom of the City[edit]
In November 1964 the City Council presented the Regiment with their Colours and six years later bestowed on it the honour of Freedom of Entrance to the city of Johannesburg. This was largely due to the efforts of Councillor J. D. Opperman who became the unit's Honorary Colonel in 1979 until he died on 20 April 2000. The Unit Colours were officially handed over on 26 February 1966. National Colours were awarded to the Unit on 5 October 1991, and laid up in April 1994.

The Regiment today[edit]
Current command structure[edit]
Honorary Colonel	: Col John Wilson
Chaplain		: Cpln Shadrack Ditabeng Kgonothi
RSM		: CWO B C Masombuka
Second-in-Command: Maj. M.J. Keretetse
Officer Commanding: Lt. Col. JN Nkosi
Unit strengths[edit]
The Regiment is an active Regiment, with strong ties between the Unit, Sister Regiments and Higher HQ. The current senior structure is a well drilled, competent unit, and all incumbents have committed to staying on until proper succession planning can kick in. Currently the unit is actively recruiting and training. The unit is supported by a strong, active Association and a widespread network of old boys. The Unit is also settled in proper Headquarters, and has the services of a permanent clerical assistant.

General activities[edit]
The unit hosts a parade annually on the first Sunday in March. Traditionally this takes place in Johannesburg, as the Regiment has Freedom of Entry to the City. This parade also serves to commemorate the birthday of the Regiment, and is dedicated to the memory of all members of the regiment that has paid the highest price in defence of our country. A medal parade is also planned for annually, but is only held when applicable. The Regiment also participates in the annual "Poppy Day" parade in November. This event is always well supported by the regiment, as well as the Association.
The Association hosts a Semi Formal dinner annually. An annual golf day fund raiser rounds off the ongoing activities.
The Association also supports the Military Associations of Gauteng, and one of the highlights every year is the MAG picnic at the War Museum. the Associations meets once a months and the main purpose is still to support the Regiment.

Regimental symbols[edit]
In May 1962 the Johannesburg City Council gave permission to the unit to use the Johannesburg City Coat of Arms as the Regimental badge. The cap badge shows minor differences to the original, as the antelope supporting the shield was substituted with 2 F. N. Rifles. The lapel badge consists of the shield portion of the cap badge. The motto is in Latin: "FORTITER ET RECTE" loosely translated this means: With Valour and Justice.

Previous dress insignia[edit]

Current dress insignia[edit]
SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia
Battle Honours[edit]
Although the Regiment saw active duty both inside and outside the borders of South Africa, it never participated in a battle worthy of Battle Honors as a Regiment. Many of its members though were part of other formations that did earn Battle Honours.

Terry SylvesterSylvester with The Escorts in 1965Background informationBirth nameTerence SylvesterBorn (1947-01-08) 8 January 1947 (age 77)Allerton, Liverpool, EnglandGenresSoft rock, popInstrument(s)Guitar, vocalsYears active1960s–presentWebsitewww.terrysylvester.comMusical artist
Terence Sylvester (born 8 January 1947)[1] is an English musician and songwriter. He is a former member of the Escorts, the Swinging Blue Jeans (1966–1969), and the Hollies. In the latter role, he took on the high parts formerly sung by Graham Nash, who had left the band in December 1968.


Life and career[edit]
Early career/The Escorts[edit]
Sylvester grew up in Allerton, Liverpool and attended school with future Badfinger guitarist, Joey Molland. At the age of 14, Sylvester was employed for a time as a panel beater by George Harrison's brother. The group he co-founded, the Escorts, appeared with the Beatles in the early 1960s.[2] The Escorts recorded their cover of "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" on Fontana Records in 1964.[3] A compilation album of the Escorts, From the Blue Angel, was issued on LP and then in 1995, on CD.[4]

The Swinging Blue Jeans[edit]
In 1966, Sylvester began a three-year stint with the Swinging Blue Jeans, replacing guitarist/vocalist Ralph Ellis.[2]

The Hollies[edit]
Sylvester's debut with the Hollies in January 1969 saw him sing on the UK chart hit singles "Sorry Suzanne" and "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother", plus on the albums Hollies Sing Dylan and Hollies Sing Hollies (both 1969), which debuted Sylvester's songwriting.[2] His first song for the group was "Gloria Swansong", and he continued to write by himself ("Pull Down the Blind", "Cable Car" 1971), with Allan Clarke ("Why Didn't You Believe", "Man Without a Heart", "Perfect Lady Housewife") and as part of Clarke-Hicks-Sylvester.
This trio composed most of the Hollies songs on several albums: Confessions of the Mind (1970), Hollies (1974), Another Night (1975), Write On and Russian Roulette (both 1976 – although neither of the latter two were issued in the US in their original form) plus A Crazy Steal (1978).
Some of Sylvester's work appeared on B-sides on singles including "Indian Girl" (1972),[5] "No More Riders" (1974),[6] in addition to singing lead vocals on the Tony Hicks and Kenny Lynch co-written song, "Oh Granny" (1972).[7]
In addition to high harmony vocals, Sylvester also sang a brief lead vocal section on the 1970 UK hit, "Gasoline Alley Bred" (sung mostly by Allan Clarke).  He then took on a greater share of responsibilities during the 1972–73 period, when Swedish vocalist, Mikael Rickfors, temporarily replaced Clarke. Sylvester sang "Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress" on the Hollies' 1973 US tour and on American television appearances. He later sang a number of lead vocals during this period on Romany (1972). This album included a cover of Judee Sill's "Jesus Was a Crossmaker". On Out on the Road (1973), Sylvester took lead vocals on several songs including "Slow Down, Go Down", "Pick Up the Pieces", and "Mr. Heartbreaker" (which was co-written with Dean Ford of Marmalade).
After a period of discontent, partly over musical policy, Sylvester split with the Hollies in May 1981, in an incident that precipitated the resignation of bassist Bernie Calvert.[2]

Solo work[edit]
In 1974, Sylvester released his eponymous solo album, re-releasing it as I Believe with a slightly revised track listing in 1976.[2] Jimmy Griffin guested harmony vocals on the song "Travelin' Boy", while Sylvester cut solo versions of his Hollies songs "Cable Car", "Indian Girl", "Pick Up the Pieces Again" and later, a solo version of his 1973 Hollies song "I Had a Dream", which was added to the CD version of the album.  The 1974 single on Polydor ("For the Peace of All Mankind", an Albert Hammond cover)[8] and a couple of singles in 1976 ("I Believe",[9] a Stevie Wonder cover, and "End of the Line") all taken from his solo album failed to chart. In 1978, Sylvester issued the non-album singles "Too Bad Lucy Jane" and "Silver and Gold" in the UK, but these also failed to chart.  He also earlier had contributed vocals to the Alan Parsons Project's first album, Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1975), singing lead on "To One in Paradise",[2] and providing background vocals on "The Cask of Amontillado", behind John Miles.
In 1994, a further solo album appeared, I Believe in Love, comprising live versions of both his Hollies and solo recorded songs, plus covers such as "It Never Rains in Southern California", from a concert recorded on 20 March 1994 in Germany.[10]

Griffin & Sylvester[edit]
In 1982, Sylvester, in collaboration with Jimmy Griffin in Memphis, Tennessee, recorded and released Griffin & Sylvester on Polydor.[2] From this album, "Please Come into My Life",[11] was released as a single.[12] In the mid-1990s, Sylvester teamed up with Griffin again as the duo 'Griffin & Sylvester', touring the UK and Canada as a part of the 'Soft Rock Cafe'.[2] The friendship and partnership continued, on and off, up to Griffin's death in January 2005.[13] Their 1982 album was re-issued on compact disc with three bonus songs in 1999.

Later releases, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame[edit]
A double album of Sylvester's recordings with the Hollies (mostly Sylvester lead vocal tracks), the Alan Parsons Project, solo, and Griffin & Sylvester entitled The Complete Works: 1969–1982, was issued in France on Magic Records in 2001.[14]
In 2010, as a member of the Hollies, Sylvester was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with Graham Nash, Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks, Bobby Elliott, Bernie Calvert and Eric Haydock.[15]

Hospital in Basel, SwitzerlandUniversity Hospital of BaselKlinikum 1GeographyLocationBasel, SwitzerlandOrganisationAffiliated universityUniversity of BaselServicesBeds773LinksWebsitewww.unispital-basel.ch
The University Hospital of Basel (German: Universitätsspital Basel, USB), in Basel, is one of the five university hospitals of Switzerland. Since 1842 it is located in a former palace, the Markgräflerhof.[1]
Until 1865 it was called the Bürgerspital (Citizens Hospital).[2] In 1865, the Canton Basel-Stadt, the University of Basel and the hospital signed an agreement through which the formation of the professionals would be enabled and the canton would cover the costs for the expansion of the hospital.[2] Since it was called the Kantonsspital (The Cantons Hospital).[2] Universitätsspital (University Hospital it is called since 2004.[2]
USB brings together 50 clinics, units and institutes all working together in an interdisciplinary manner[3] and employs a staff of about 5000.[4] Since the beginning of 2012, the University Hospital has been an independent business. Following its spin-off from the state administration of the Canton of Basel-Stadt, it now has the organisational form of a state-owned enterprise.
With its 7,219 employees (as of 31 December 2017), who treat around 38,000 inpatients per year (as of 2017), the University Hospital Basel is one of the largest employers in the region. A characteristic feature is its close relationship with the University of Basel and the life sciences companies based in the region. With an approximate 670 beds, USB is the biggest healthcare facility in north-western Switzerland.[5]
USB provides services in all fields of medicine apart from pediatrics.[6]
In 1953 the hospital was one of the first that did extensive research on the first neuroleptic Chlorpromazine.[7]
The hospital is well known for its special form of hormone-delivered radiotherapy to treat neuroendocrine cancer, tried by Steve Jobs in 2009.[8] In Mai 2022, the University Hospital became the majority stakeholder of the Bethesda Hospital in Basel.[9]
