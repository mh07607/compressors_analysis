Howard Harris (born February 9, 1958) is a former American wrestler. He was a NCAA national champion and four-time All-American at Oregon State University. Harris was the national champion in the heavyweight weight class at the 1980 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships and was named the most outstanding wrestler of the tournament, becoming the first African American to win the award.


High school[edit]
Harris attended McNary High School in Keizer, Oregon, winning the state team championship as a junior in 1975. He was undefeated that year until the state tournament finals when he had to forfeit due to an injury.  In 1976, his senior year, McNary placed second in state but Harris won an individual state championship while being undefeated at 191 lbs.[1] He completed his high school wrestling career with a mark of 80-5. In addition to his wrestling talents he was an Oregon All-State football player, racking up a total of 1448 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns while leading McNary to its first state tournament berth.[2][dead link]

College[edit]
Harris is one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of Oregon State University. He was a four-time All-American at 190 lbs and heavyweight, and holds the school record for career wins (169) and single season pins (40, 1980). He won the NCAA Heavyweight championship in 1980 with a perfect record of 46-0 and is one of only five wrestlers to pin every opponent in the NCAA tournament.[3] His dominance at the NCAA tournament garnered him the Outstanding Wrestler Award, the first African-American to win the award.[4]
Many major college wrestling programs wanted to sign Harris after his dominant senior year of high school. The day before letters of intent could be signed he announced he would wrestle for Oklahoma. His high school coach, National Wrestling Hall of Fame inductee Jerry Lane, contacted Oregon State wrestling coach Dale Thomas, a two-time national coach of the year and National Wrestling Hall of Fame member himself. Thomas met with Harris that day and convinced Harris that staying in the state would give him an opportunity at a national championship and set him up for success once his college days were over.[5]

Olympics[edit]
Harris was a member of the 1980 United States Olympic Team. However, the United States boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow meant Harris couldn't compete. He did compete in the 1981 World Cup of Wrestling where he faced Olympic Champion Sanasar Oganisyan. Oganisyan got the best of Harris, winning by decision.[6]

Personal[edit]
Harris is married with four sons and one daughter. His son Major played defensive end for the Portland State Vikings football team.[7]

The Property was the name of an artists colony located in Malibu that lasted from 1962 to 1993. It was home to artists and actors such as Lita Albuquerque, Elyn Zimmerman, Arthur Malet, Patrick Villiers Farrow, Mia Farrow and Michael Greene.

History[edit]
The Property was located on the 132-acre land that had housed Malibu's Coffee House Positano, on a hill overlooking California's highway 1. The coffee house became a focal point for southern California artists of the '60s and '70s to congregate and collaborate. It housed live avant-garde theater, political debates, lectures and art displays including the premiere of a play by Picasso.
Soon after Positano closed in 1962, John Wilder, an actor and budding scriptwriter, and Jerry Ziegman, also an aspiring screenwriter, established an artists community on the location simply called "The Property." Initially, Ziegman's intention was to use the place as a weekend retreat to relax and have parties. This evolved into an attempt to invent a new kind of artists colony. Ziegman believed that creativity was insufficiently rewarded in America, and wanted to rent spaces to artists he thought could benefit from having an inexpensive place to work and live. In his uncompleted memoir, Malibu Book 1962-1982, he characterized his creation as a “Commune of Autocrats.”[1][2]
For the next 31 years over 50 people lived at The Property. Among the residents were scriptwriters such as David Seidler, John Wilder and Jacqueline Feather; Rosa Jordan, a writer; Lita Albuquerque and Elyn Zimmerman, environmental artists; Jim Fiorito, a painter; Bond Johnson, a musician/poet; Susan Farrow, a weaver; actors such as Arthur Malet, Patrick Villiers Farrow, Mia Farrow and Michael Greene; Steve Kahn, a photographer; Aino Paasonen, a poet; Pamela Burton, a landscape architect; Richard Hertz, an art historian; Bruce Dath, a Buddhist truck driver/contractor; Rabbi Don Singer, a Zen rabbi; and Karla Conway, a Playmate of the Month.
The Property was unique among other artists colonies in that it was not funded through private means or foundations. Artists were allowed to stay indefinitely, and families with children were welcome.[1]

Destruction and legacy[edit]
The colony was destroyed in the 1993 Malibu fire.
Many of the residents reported that living at The Property had a profound impact on their lives. They returned annually to the ruins to remember their lives at this place and to renew old friendships.[3][4][5][6]

John SalusburyAn 18th-century copy of a portrait of Sir John SalusburyBorn1567Died24 July 1612 (aged 44–45)NationalityWelshOccupation(s)Statesman; poet; patronYears active1585–1612Notable workSinetes PassionsLove's MartyrSir John Salusbury (1567 – 24 July 1612) was a Welsh knight, politician and poet of the Elizabethan era. He is notable for his opposition to the faction of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and for his patronage of complex acrostic and allegorical poetry that anticipated the Metaphysical movement.

Life[edit]
Salusbury was a member of the Salusbury family of Lleweni in the Vale of Clwyd, Denbighshire, where they owned a considerable estate, including Lleweni Hall.  Various members of the family acquired honours and appointments through their support of the Tudor monarchs. He was the son of Sir John Salusbury and Katheryn of Berain, and the younger brother of Thomas Salusbury, who was executed in 1586 for his involvement in the Babington Plot against Elizabeth I.[citation needed]
He was born in 1567 and educated at Jesus College, Oxford, where he matriculated in 1581 aged 14. After his brother's execution, he succeeded to the estates, but the family's lands were severely reduced due to the loss of crown leases. It took him several years to restore them.[1] He studied law at the Middle Temple from March 1595.  Elizabeth appointed him as squire of the body in the same year. Salusbury became noted for his "ostentatious loyalty" to the queen, in contrast to other members of his family, who were associated with Catholic sympathies and plots against her. Salusbury was a staunch Protestant, writing to the queen's minister, Robert Cecil denouncing recusants.[2] He was also an opponent of the Earl of Essex, with whose supporters he came into conflict in local politics. He almost killed his cousin Owen, an Essex supporter, in a sword fight in 1593. Owen was already being treated with suspicion as a potential rebel, so the duel did Salusbury no harm. The 5th Earl of Derby, his wife's brother, wrote to congratulate him for beating "that bad fellow of your name", saying that the event would be to the "advancement of your credit".[1]
After the Essex Rebellion, on 14 June 1601, Salusbury was knighted for his support in suppressing it.[3] His cousins Owen and John were implicated in the rebellion, Owen being killed in the fighting.  These conflicts led to the "Wrexham riot" in October 1601, during an election to parliament, in which Salusbury's supporters engaged in violent clashes with the surviving Essex supporters led by Sir Richard Trevor. Salusbury complained to the queen about intimidation. After a recount, he was declared the winner of the election.[4]  He became MP for Denbighshire in December 1601, but only took his seat for a few days before parliament was dissolved.[2]
After Elizabeth's death, Essex's surviving supporters returned to favour at the court of her successor James I. Thereafter, Salusbury spent little time in London, with his enemies attempting to discredit him at court.[5] Salusbury took an interest in gardening, botany, and herbal medicine at Lleweni.[6] His copy of Gerard's Herbal survives at Christ Church, Oxford with annotations describing plants and herbs found in Welsh gardens or growing wild around the year 1606, with some of his notes of recipes. He died on 24 July 1612.[5]

Family[edit]
Salusbury married Ursula Stanley, the illegitimate daughter of Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby and Jane Halsall, in 1586. Their first child, Jane, was born on 6 October 1586.[7] The couple went on to have ten children, of whom six survived to adulthood: four girls and two boys. His son Henry Salusbury became the first of the Salusbury Baronets in 1619.[5]

Literature[edit]
The title page of Chester's Love's Martyr, dedicated to Salusbury
Salusbury was a poet and patron of literature. Several works were dedicated to him. In 1595 Henry Perry dedicated his book of Welsh grammar Egluryn Ffraethineb to Salusbury. Sinetes Passions (1597) a collection of verse by Robert Parry, was also dedicated to Salusbury.  The most important work linked to Salusbury is Robert Chester's book Love's Martyr, which is dedicated to Sir John.[citation needed]
Both Parry and Chester seem to have been local Denbighshire writers who formed part of Salusbury's own circle. Salusbury's own poetry may have been published in Parry's collection in the section entitled the "patron's pathetical posies", though this has been disputed.[8] These include a complex symbolic poem addressed to his sister-in-law, Dorothy Halsall. Other sonnets and love lyrics of his exist in manuscripts.[citation needed]
Chester was probably Salusbury's chaplain or secretary. His long and extremely obscure allegory about a phoenix and turtledove has led to several conflicting interpretations. The most common are that it symbolises either the love of John and Ursula, or alternatively the idealised relationship between Sir John and Queen Elizabeth.[2] Chester's poem contains a series of "Cantos" at the end of the allegory. William Empson argues that the "Cantos" are by Salusbury, as they are similar in style to those appended to Robert Parry's book, displaying Salusbury's "very recognisable facility and ingenuity".[9] E. A. J. Honigmann argues that Salusbury had a fascination with "mystical verse" which contained obscure acrostic puzzles, and that his patronage explains the unique metaphysical symbolism of Parry's, Chester's and his own verse.[10]
Salusbury also seems to have been acquainted with Ben Jonson, who may have been the person responsible for organising a group of important poets to contribute verses to supplement Chester's poems. Among these were Jonson himself, John Marston, George Chapman and William Shakespeare, who contributed The Phoenix and the Turtle.[11] These poems share the imagery of Love's Martyr and Salusbury's typical elusive and complex allegorising.[according to whom?]

Lin Fengmian's works, who was labelled as a "Black Painter" who hated socialism.[1] Some of Lin Fengmian's paintings were named and criticised as "Black Mountain's evil water"[1][2]
The "Black Painting" incident, also known as the criticism of the Black Painting movement, was a political movement during the cultural revolution in mainland China.[2][3][4] In the few months following January 1974, Yao WenYuan, Jiang Qing, and others launched a criticism of Chinese paintings they considered problematic, exhibiting hundreds of "Black Paintings" in the Great Hall of the People, the National Art Museum of China, and other places. They were exhibited to the head of the central government as well as the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers so that the groups could criticize the paintings.[2][3][5][6] There is no uniform definition of "Black Painting", though most Black Painters were accused of distorting, vilifying, or attacking socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat; catering to the Western bourgeoisie and revisionism; or remembering Lin Biao.[2][3][4][5][6] The entire art circle in mainland China, including hundreds of painters such as Li Keran, Huang Yongyu, Lin Fengmian, Feng Zikai, and Li Kuchan, were implicated. Among them, Huang Yongyu's painting "Owl" was listed at the top of the "Black Painting Exhibition".[2][3][5][6][7] The "Black Painting" incident is related to the criticism of Lin Piao and the Confucius movement as it pertained to Zhou Enlai, then Premier of the State Council[2][3][8][9]


History[edit]
Background[edit]
See also: Foreign relations of China and Cultural Revolution
During the Cultural Revolution, the well-known painter Wu Guanzhong (third from left) and his colleagues and students were re-educated in Hebei.
In 1966, Mao Zedong and others launched the Cultural Revolution in mainland China [10][11] As early as 1964, Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, and others criticised the late master of traditional Chinese painting Qi Baishi. In the early stage of the Cultural Revolution, Qi Baishi was "down", and Huang Yu became the first Black Painter to be publicly criticised [12][13][14] In the late Cultural Revolution, from 1971 to 1973, because the "highest instructions" could not be imposed on others in diplomatic activities, Zhou Enlai, then Premier of the State Council, instructed several times that the artworks arranged by major hotels should conform to the national style and contain the spirit of the times. He also said they should reflect China's artistic level.[4][8][12] At the same time, Zhou Enlai and others presided over the recovery and development of foreign economy and trade and resumed foreign exports in 1972. Zhou Enlai, Li Xiannian, and others believed that exporting paintings could earn foreign exchange, but found few buyers of revolutionary propaganda paintings. Instead, they printed publications and published a large number of paintings by artists such as Li Keran.[5][15] It included the picture album of "Chinese Painting" compiled and printed by the Shanghai Arts and Crafts Branch of China Light Industry Import and Export Company, with eight-colour printing and Chinese and English comparison - a publicity product for export.[2][3][6]
After the September 1st incident[clarification needed] in 1971, Zhou Enlai transferred some well-known painters such as Wu Zuoren, Li Keran, and Li Kuchan back to Beijing in the name of the diplomatic needs for Nixon's visit to China in 1972.[16][17] Zhou Enlai pointed out that it was inappropriate to hang portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong's Quotations everywhere in hotels that received foreign guests, including overseas Chinese, Hong Kongese, Macanese, and Taiwanese compatriots.[12] At that time, most of the transferred painters were painting for hotels and were thus known as the "Hotel Painting School". A group arranged of them for art decoration for the recent building of the Beijing Hotel. The central hall of the building was surrounded by Yuan Yunfu, Wu Guanzhong, Zhu Da Nian, and Huang Yongyu.[2][12][18] On October 1973, during a travelling sketch for this purpose, Huang Yongyu was invited to draw an owl, which was later listed as the head of the "Black Painting" movement on a page for Song Wenzhi, and was by chance at the painter Xu Linlu's home.[2][3][9][12][18]

Timeline[edit]

On the evening of November 23, 1973, Wang Mantian (Mao Zedong's niece), then deputy leader of the Cultural Group of the State Council, Gao Jinde, Shao Yu, the head of the Art Department of the Cultural Group, and others raised the issue of "Black Painting" for the first time at a meeting at the Beijing Friendship Hotel.[2][18][19] Since then, the forces of the Gang of Four have launched a national "Black Painting" tracing activity. On December 15 of the same year, the People's Daily published an article "We should attach importance to class struggle in the field of culture and art" signed by "Culan", in which[2][18][20]

The overthrown landlord bourgeoisie refused to give up their ideological and cultural positions easily. In some corners, they were still stubbornly resisting. For example, in some places, some people play bad dramas, talk bad books, sing bad songs, and secretly or openly compete with the proletariat for ideological and cultural positions. ... We should mobilise the masses to consciously resist the spread of bad dramas, bad books, bad songs, and bad paintings, and use socialist literature and art to occupy the position, to effectively defend and develop the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.
In Shanghai's "black painting" campaign, the well-known painter Feng Zikai took the brunt. The picture shows the works of Feng Zikai.
On January 2, 1974, Yao Wenyuan severely criticised the Chinese Painting album in Shanghai, which was regarded as the official beginning of the "black painting incident".[2][3][18] At a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, Yao Wenyuan accused the album of "Black Water in Montenegro", "Retance of Countercurrent", "Catering the Western bourgeoisie and Revisionism, and a local authentic "self-restraint" album". The "black painting" movement is linked to the "criticism of Lin, Kong and Zhou Gong", and the spearhead is aimed at Zhou Enlai.[3][4][8][9][12] the Spring Festival in 1974, Wang Mantian led a group of critoes to Beijing Hotel, Liuguo Hotel and other places to select "Black Paintings",[2][4][12][21] began to plan the Black Painting[2][8] exhibition with the intent of "countering the re-back tide of literary and artistic black lines in the field". He also sent people to more than a dozen provinces and cities across the country to search for "Black Paintings". Despite this, there is no clear standard as to what constitutes a black painting. Ultimately, they selected more than 200 paintings and held a "Black Painting Exhibition"[4][12] in Beijing in mid-February. The exhibition was called "criticizing the forest and criticising the Kong to contact the reality of the art front" and was held in the Great Hall of the People and the National Art Museum of China.[2][6][8][16] It is said that it was exhibited in the Great Hall of the People at the Review. It was exhibited at the National Art Museum of China in early April for the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants and soldiers to visit and criticise.[4][12]
At the same time, on March 29, Beijing Daily published an article titled "Assessed Paintings Created by Some Hotels and Hotels", making the crusade against "Black Paintings" public for the first time. In addition to criticizing Huang Yongyu's "Owl", The article also criticized the works of Zong Qixiang, Li Keran, Wu Zuoren and other painters.[2] On April 5, "Beijing Daily" published a related report on Beijing Hotel's campaign to criticize "black paintings", titled "Resolutely Criticize "Self-restraint and Return to Rituals" in Contact with the Reality, and Resolutely Fight Against the Resurgence of Black Lines in Literature and Art", the report wrote:[2]

Comrades from the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts sent two big-character posters to the hotel, sharply criticizing the hotel’s leadership for the problem of some black paintings on the traditional Chinese paintings that the hotel was preparing for the decoration of the rooms in the new building. They considered it a serious mistake to give the green light to the resurgence of the black line of literature and art. These two revolutionary big-character posters shocked the hotel leaders. They convened the party committee that night and organized employees to see the black paintings exhibition. Everyone was very angry after seeing the black and bad paintings, and quickly set off a critique of criticism. Within two weeks, they wrote 260. Many manuscripts were criticized, nine criticism meetings were held, and more than 70 people made speeches.
The "Black Painting" movement also spread to Shanghai, Shaanxi, Hubei and other places. Many critical articles appeared in newspapers and periodicals in various places, which affected the entire art world.[6][7][8][18] In Shaanxi province alone, more than 20 painters were labeled with the "Black painting" term, including Shi Lu, then chairman of the Shaanxi branch of the Chinese Artists Association. The relevant departments in Shaanxi also set up a preparatory group to criticize "anti-animators" Shi Lu, and mobilized Xi'an Dozens of scholars from the fields of politics, literature, history, and fine arts came to comment on Shi Lu's so-called "black paintings", and produced a book "Annotation on Shi Lu's Reactionary Calligraphy and Painting".[6][8][22]

Conclusion[edit]
Wu Zuoren, who was criticized as a "black painter"[23]
In April 1974, when the campaign of criticizing "Black Paintings" reached its climax, Mao Zedong issued the "supreme instruction" on the issue of criticizing "Black Paintings", saying: "Chinese paintings, with splashes of ink, how can they not be black?... Owl One eye is open, and the other eye is closed.”[2][4][12][18] Afterwards, the movement to criticize “black paintings” gradually cooled down. However, until the end of 1974, there was still a small amount critical articles being published regularly.[2][18] On November 26, 1974, the "People's Daily" published an article signed by "Xiaoluan" "The Art of Fighting in the Picture Scroll of the Times - After Viewing the National Art Exhibition", which mentioned the criticism of "black paintings" in the following form [2][24]

Examples of "Black Painting" Criticism[edit]
Huang Yongyu's "Owl" was listed at the top of the "Black Painting Exhibition",[2][3][6][16] and there are documents that this work was characterized as "Tianzi No. 1 Counter-revolutionary Black Painting".[4][12] Because of this, Huang Yongyu and his family were locked up in the bullpen.[25][26] On March 29, 1974, "Beijing Daily" published an article titled "Assessing the Paintings Created by Some Hotels and Hotels", thinking:[2]

You see, isn’t this picture of an owl with one eye open and one eye closed fully revealing the hostility of the creators who hate the reality of the socialist revolution and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution? Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the creators of this black painting had concocted a series of reactionary fables with animals as the theme, viciously attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat in the superstructure field as a "snap" of spiders, and abusing the Great Leap Forward as if "The donkey pulling the mill" can only circle in place, and so on. This is the man who has always been dissatisfied with the criticism of him by the revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and even engraved the words "lawless" on the stamp, in a vain attempt to negate the law of the dictatorship of the proletariat and change the sky of socialism. The poisonous weed "Owl" is a concentrated expression of the reactionary psychology of the creators.
In the album "Chinese Painting", there is a picture titled "Welcome to Spring". The painter is Chen Dayu, and the painting is a rooster crowing in front of the winter jasmine flowers.[27][28] In this regard, Yao Wenyuan wrote the following instructions:[2][3][6]

The painting features a few pale winter jasmines at the upper end of the frame and an angry rooster is prominently depicted in the whole painting. This rooster's mouth is closed, its crown is erect, its neck feathers are flaring, its claws are scratching the ground, its eyes are rolled, and its tail is raised to the sky. Air and posture. ... This is not welcoming the spring, it is completely an extreme hatred of the socialist spring and the prosperous scene after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. On this angry rooster with its tail up in the sky, there is entrusted the dark psychology of a small group of "restoration fanatics" in today's society. They are not reconciled to their own failures and are ready to fight the proletariat anytime, anywhere."
On May 31, 1974, Shanghai's "Wen Wei Po" published an article signed by "Lin Chengfu" ""Black Mountains and Bad Waters" Hidden Harm", which focused on criticizing Li Keran's works:[2]

Li Keran (left) is known for his landscape painting
In front of us is a volume of "Chinese Painting". The first thing that catches our eyes is a puddle of ink on the cover. After a closer look, it is a Chinese painting titled "Landscape". Such a painting of "Black Mountain and Evil Water" is placed on the cover, and it even occupies two-thirds of the cover, which shows how much the editor and printer valued it... You see, in this picture Up and near, there are many strange rocks and ghostly shadows, dark and eerie; in the distance, barren mountains like wolf teeth are wrapped in purple-gray clouds, and the only ray of sky is dark clouds, which are utterly oppressive. I can't breathe. At the bottom of the mountain is a twisting and turbid stream of sewage, and a few weak boats with broken sails are drawn crookedly. The whole picture is deformed and weird, with black mountains and black waters. Also in this album is a landscape painting entitled "Huangshan", an old work of this "famous artist" in 1963, and it is the same. In the middle of the painting is a dark pile, and a few sparse dead trees are dotted on the bald mountain and rocks. The lower left corner is still deliberately managed, and there is a pale ancient pavilion in the corner, and a villain who has been uglinessed like a ghost is even more black. It is ugly and unsightly. Under the writer's pen, the beautiful and lush Huangshan was ruined like this!

Alexander John Milne (18 December 1929 – 17 December 1993) was a South African judge from Natal Province. He was Judge President of the Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa from 1982 to 1987. During that time, he was reputed as a liberal judge on the basis of his judgements in the Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial and other cases involving anti-apartheid protest. He joined the Natal Division in 1971, was promoted to the Appellate Division in 1988, and served on the latter bench until his death in 1993. 


Early life and education[edit]
Milne was born on 18 December 1929 in Pietermaritzburg in the former Natal Province.[1] His father, Alexander "Sandy" Milne, was at the time a member of the Natal Bar;[1] he was later a judge of the Natal Provincial Division and its Judge President from 1962 to 1969.[2] Milne matriculated at Hilton College in 1946 and took a law BA at Rhodes University, with distinction in Roman law, in 1949.[1] He went on to read jurisprudence at Exeter College, Oxford, where he graduated with first-class honours in 1952.[1]

Legal career[edit]
Upon returning to South Africa, Milne read in chambers with Charles Warner QC,[1] and he was admitted as an advocate of the Natal Provincial Division, on 12 June 1953.[2] After 12 years of junior practice, he took silk in April 1965. During his brief practice as senior counsel, he led evidence for the state in the James Commission of Inquiry into municipal irregularities in Natal, and also represented the state in a related criminal trial.[1] In 1968, he acted on the bench in the Natal Division, then led by his father, for the first time.[2]

Natal Provincial Division: 1971–1988[edit]
In March 1971, Milne was appointed permanently as a judge of the Natal Division.[2] After just over a decade on the Natal bench, in September 1981, he was promoted to the newly created post of Deputy Judge President of the Natal Division;[1] and in October the following year, he succeeded Neville James as Judge President of the division, the post formerly held by his father.[3] He remained in office as Judge President until December 1987.[2]

Apartheid security laws[edit]
Milne presided at the height of apartheid in South Africa, marked by the widespread application of the Internal Security Act of 1982 and by several states of emergency imposed in the mid-1980s. In this context, the Natal Division under Milne was regarded as the most liberal bench in the country,[3][4][5] and Milne himself – with Michael Corbett, John Didcott, and others – was regarded personally as maintaining "the minority position of ameliorist sensitivity to liberty wherever possible", both in his decisions and in his out-of-court statements.[6]



One of the miracles of the 1990–1993 transitional process is the acceptance of an enhanced role for judges under the new Constitution. Many individuals and factors have contributed to this. But John Milne's contribution must surely rank among the greatest. As a judge, and particularly as Judge President of the Natal Provincial Division, he showed that law and justice are inseparable and that the institutions of the law can survive only if they take account of this truth... [H]e has left lawyers a rich legacy – an example of judicial courage and leadership in the promotion of human rights.


–– Obituary by John Dugard, 1994[3]

For one example, in August 1985, during the civil unrest that surrounded the Vaal uprising, Milne urged in a speech in Durban that politicians should prioritise the development of a bill of rights, so that judges could play an active role in establishing fairness and equity.[7] The following month, he issued an order instructing the South African Police to desist assaulting and imposing pressure on a political detainee, Billy Nair of the anti-apartheid United Democratic Front; Milne said that assaults in police custody constituted "a state of affairs which no civilised nation, particularly one which professes to follow Christian principles, could tolerate for one moment".[8] Dhaya Pillay, at the time an activist lawyer, later said that Milne had personally intervened to ensure that political detainees held under the state of emergency had access to lawyers and family visits.[9] On one occasion, he intervened in the case of Yusuf Vawda, a human rights lawyer held incommunicado under security laws, by sending Judge Brian Galgut to visit the cells; according to Pillay, the move "revitalised" the detainees' faith in "the rule of law, enforced by trustworthy, independent and impartial judiciary".[9]
Then, in August 1986, the Natal Division, led by Milne, declared as invalid two key provisions in the prevailing state-of-emergency regulations – those empowering indiscriminate arrest without warrant and indefinite detention without trial – and thereby invalidated all ongoing emergency detentions in Natal. Milne said that President P. W. Botha had exceeded his legal authority in proclaiming the regulations.[10] In general, by March 1987, academic John Dugard observed that the Natal Division had "acquired a new reputation for judicial independence in matters affecting race and security" since Milne's appointment as Judge President.[11] According to Dugard, "The renaissance of justice in Natal was widely acclaimed and Natal became a favourite forum for human rights litigation."[3]

Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial[edit]
Main article: Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial
Also in 1985–1986, Milne presided in the high-profile Pietermaritzburg Treason Trial,[12] which ended in the acquittal of 16 prominent United Democratic Front activists. The state dropped the charges against the final defendants after Milne's ruling in S v Ramgobin and Others (1986), which held that videotape recordings (in this case, recordings of political speeches) were admissible evidence only if it was proven that they were original recordings and that there existed no reasonable possibility of interference with them; the judgement remains authoritative in South African law of evidence.[13] Dhaya Pillay said of the judgement:
Judges with conscience and imagination, conscientious and clever judges will strive to find appropriate rules of law to apply to circumstances of a case to achieve justice. Judge Milne had been appointed by an apartheid president. However, as a legal scholar, law meant justice to him. By applying a technical rule of law on evidence, he directly raised the standard of proof prosecutors must produce before the burden shifts to the accused to defend themselves; indirectly, he gave effect to the right to freedom of expression in politics. Judges like John Milne are respected, remembered and loved. Good judges turn the tide of strife towards democracy.[9]A month after the judgement, in July 1986, Dugard told the New York Times that Milne's conduct in the Pietermaritzburg trial and other such cases was among several factors that was inspiring increasing judicial confidence and a willingness to challenge executive actions.[5]
Appellate Division: 1988–1993[edit]
Milne left the Natal Division in order to take up appointment as a junior judge of appeal on South Africa's highest court, the Appellate Division in Bloemfontein, where he began work in early 1988. According to Michael Corbett, Milne said that his initial inclination was to decline the promotion but that he had accepted out of a reluctance to "put personal convenience before duty".[1]
In 1993, Milne led the one-man Milne Commission into the Granting of Certain Powers to Legal Practitioners and Related Matters, a judicial inquiry appointed by the General Council of the Bar and tasked primarily with making recommendations about attorneys' rights of audience in the Supreme Court.[1] However, David Dyzenhaus later suggested that the Chief Justice "carefully kept him (and other untrustworthy judges) off panels that decided public law issues to do with resistance to apartheid", so that his promotion "both weakened the Natal Bench and had no impact on the Appellate Division".[4] Nonetheless, according to Dugard, Milne was "expected to play a major role" in the post-apartheid order;[3] negotiations over South Africa's Interim Constitution were completed shortly before Milne's death.

Personal life and death[edit]
Milne met his wife, Shirley, at Rhodes University, and they married in July 1953.[1] He was involved in the administration of competitive fly-fishing in Natal and also served on the Natal Parks Board.[1]
He died unexpectedly in office on 17 December 1993, the day before his 64th birthday, while motoring in the English countryside on a holiday with his wife and son.[1][2]

Tenerani (foaled April 14, 1944 in Italy) was a Champion Thoroughbred racehorse who raced in Italy and in England. Bred by Lydia & Federico Tesio, he was named for the Italian sculptor, Pietro Tenerani. His dam was Tofanella, a foundation broodmare for the Tesio's Dormello Stud in Dormelletto, Italy.[1] Damsire Apelle, owned and bred by Tesio, was one of the first horses from Italy to meet with success in racing outside the county. Tenerani's sire, Bellini, was also bred and raced by Federico Tesio and whose wins included the 1940 Derby Italiano.
Trained by Federico Tesio, Tenerani was winner at age two in 1946, and in 1947 the Italian 3-Yr-Old Champion Colt. Sent to compete in England in 1948, he won the Goodwood Cup and the Queen Elizabeth Stakes, a precursor of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Tenerani raced and won in Italy at age five in 1949 before being retired to stud duty. In 1951 he was sent to stand at stud in England where he most notably sired Ribot, widely regarded as one of the great horses in the history of Thoroughbred racing.

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tenerani&oldid=898910467"Modelling British railway prototypes is a hobby where railway modelling is applied to British prototypes.  For historical reasons, British model scales have developed somewhat separately from those in other countries, and the commercial standards; 00 gauge and British N gauge are unique to British prototypes.  The railways in Britain were for the most part standard gauge, and consequently most support focuses on these scales.  Narrow gauge, and broad gauge standards also exist.  British modellers tend to focus on British subjects, and most of the commercial support is British-based, but modellers of British prototypes exist across national boundaries.


Standard gauge prototypes[edit]
Commercially available standards[edit]
There are two major commercial standards; 00 gauge (4 mm:foot, 16.5 mm gauge), and British N gauge (2.05 mm:foot, 9 mm gauge).  Ready-to-run (RTR) equipment is available in both standards.  Hornby Railways and Bachmann Branchline offer major RTR support in 00 gauge; Graham Farish (part of the Bachmann group) offer RTR support in N gauge.
Previously commercial support was available for British TT gauge (3mm:foot, 12mm gauge).
All three of these commercial standards suffer from being too narrow to accurately represent the track gauges, and as a result, finescale standards have been developed.

Finescale standards[edit]
As a consequence, of the track gauges, plus overscale track, finescale standards have been developed.  These include EM gauge (4 mm scale, 18.2 mm gauge), P4 gauge (4 mm scale, 18.83 mm gauge), 3 mm finescale (3 mm scale, 14.2 mm gauge), 2 mm finescale (2 mm scale, 9.47 mm gauge).  Others have adopted H0 gauge.

Narrow gauge prototypes[edit]
The most straightforward way of modelling narrow gauge is to adopting a larger scale but with the track from the appropriate gauge. Thus, the most common standard for narrow gauge modelling are 009 (4 mm scale, 9 mm gauge) and 016.5 (7 mm scale, 16.5 mm gauge).  These tend not to accurately represent real scales, so again there are products made to the smaller gauge but with sleeper spacing, etc., suitable for the larger scale narrow gauge trains.

Societies[edit]
Societies include the following:

British 1:87 Scale Society - support for British H0 scale
Double O Gauge Association - support for 00 gauge
009 Society - support for 4 mm scale narrow gauge.
EM Gauge Society - support for 4 mm finescale (EM and P4)
Gauge 0 Guild - support for 0 gauge
Historical Model Railway Society (HMRS), support for historical model railways.
N Gauge Society (NGS) - support for N gauge (including international N gauge standards)
Scalefour Society (support for P4, including Irish broad gauge and Great Western broad gauge)

"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" (1995)

"You Win My Love" (1996)
Music video"(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!" on YouTube

"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" is a song co-written and recorded by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain. It was released on November 15, 1995, as the fourth single from her second studio album, The Woman in Me. Written by Twain and then-husband and producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange, the song is lyrically a warning to "pickup artists" who are searching for one-night stands instead of real love.
The song topped the Canadian RPM 100 Country Tracks chart and the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart for six and two weeks, respectively. An alternate remix was released to Australia in November 1996, peaking at number five on the ARIA Singles Chart. "I'm Outta Here!" was later included on Twain's 2004 Greatest Hits package, and has been performed on all of her tours. In 1997, the Eurodance group Real McCoy covered "I'm Outta Here!".


Chart performance[edit]
"I'm Outta Here!" debuted at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of November 18, 1995. It spent 20 weeks on the chart and peaked at number one on February 3, 1996, where it remained for two weeks; it marked her second number one country hit after "Any Man of Mine".[citation needed] The song also topped the Country Singles Sales chart for one week. Released as a double a-side single with the title track, "I'm Outta Here!" debuted on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 on November 28, 1995, at number 90.[1] The song later reached a peak of number 74 on the January 6, 1996, issue;[1] "I'm Outta Here!" marked Twain's second Hot 100 entry after the double a-side single "Any Man Of Mine/Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?".
In Twain's native Canada, "I'm Outta Here!" debuted at number 77 on the Canadian RPM Country Tracks chart on November 20, 1995.[2] "I'm Outta Here!" rose quickly to number one, where it reached on January 8, 1996.[3] The song spent six consecutive weeks at number one, only tying with "Love Gets Me Every Time" to being Twain's longest run at the top of the chart. The song also made an appearance on the RPM Adult Contemporary Chart, peaking at number 49 on March 4, 1996.[4]
Whilst previous singles like "You Lay a Whole Lot of Love on Me" and "The Woman in Me (Needs the Man in You)" were released internationally, "I'm Outta Here was Twain's first successful single outside North America. The song became a particular hit in Australia, where an alternate version remixed by Mutt Lange was released instead. "I'm Outta Here!" debuted at number 37 on the ARIA Singles Chart on November 24, 1996. It climbed to its peak position of number five on January 26, 1997, where it remained for two weeks. It spent a total of 22 weeks on the chart.[5]

Music video[edit]
The music video for "I'm Outta Here!" was shot in New York City and directed by Steven Goldmann. It was filmed on November 4, 1995, and released 11 days later. The video is radically different from Twain's previous videos, and its pop rock feel and sex appeal engendered into most of Twain's subsequent videos.
The video begins with a shot of Twain standing behind a blue light in front of a man sitting on a chair. She walks up to the man, who stands up and flips over his chair, meanwhile, the video cuts to a slow-motion shot of people dancing in a club and a shot of Twain walking up to a microphone in front of her and surrounded by many people playing drums. It cuts back to Twain trying to sit on the chair, when the man kicks it away for her to fall on the floor. But the next shot of them is them laughing and pushing away as people start to come over. In the subsequent shots, intercut with shots of Twain performing alone without the drums, Twain and several others drumming near a window, and Twain on a balcony, friends grab the microphone off of Twain and engage in a karaoke session with her, male stereotypes try to turn on Twain near the microphone, Twain teaches people a dance routine, people play air guitar with fake guitars, and Twain plays along to the drummers. In the final shot, Twain walks out of the building alone.
Three versions of the video were released; the 'Album Version' for country music video channels, the 'Mutt Lange Remix' for Australia and the 'Dance Remix' for Canadian pop channels. The 'Album Version' video is available on Twain's DVD The Platinum Collection, while the 'Mutt Lange Mix' video is available on iTunes, VEVO and YouTube. The video won the Video of the Year Award at the 1996 Canadian Country Music Awards.[6]
On video-sharing website YouTube, the video is one of Twain's least-viewed videos on the platform, with only 2.8 million views as of February 2021.

Live performances[edit]
During Twain's Come On Over Tour and Up! Tour, the song was performed as the last main song of the setlist before returning to the stage for her encores. Each of the cities Twain visited on both tours, she would invite a local school Marching Band drum line to join her on stage. Twain would also play the drums along as well on stage. At the end of the song on the Come On Over Tour, Twain leads the drummers into a drum roll, which leads into a grand finale, including Twain standing on top of a big drum, while an electric lap steel guitar solo plays, before disappearing into it as fireworks and confetti erupt from the stage. On the Up! Tour, she again leads the drummers in joining in a big drum roll which lets off the fireworks with Twain disappearing after the song ends. The song has also been performed during her Vegas residency and her Rock This Country tour as the last song before the encore.

The Halliwell Jones Stadium is a rugby league stadium in Warrington, England, which is the home ground of the Warrington Wolves. It has also staged Challenge Cup semi-finals, the European Nations Final, the National League Grand Finals' Day, two games of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup and four games of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.


History[edit]
1990s–2004: Origins and construction[edit]
By the late 1990s, Warrington's Wilderspool Stadium had become decrepit and unfit for purpose, and so the club looked to move to a new stadium. Before settling on a site just north of the town centre, which had formerly housed the Tetley Walker brewery, a site in Burtonwood was considered but these plans were rejected.
Ground was broke at the new site in 2002 and bucked the common trend of modern stadia by including terracing areas rather than being an all-seater stadium, with the South and West stands both containing terracing It also has enormous pitch dimensions of 120 m x 74 m, as requested by Warrington's head coach of the time, Paul Cullen, due to his desire to play expansive rugby. The stadium officially opened in 2004.

2011–present: Expansion[edit]
During the 2010 Championship Grand Final between Featherstone Rovers and Halifax, a fire beneath the terraced West Stand broke out, forcing all of the fans housed in the stand to be evacuated onto the field, holding up the game for around 45 minutes. Following a safety inspection the spectators were eventually allowed back in. However, when the smell of smoke failed to disperse, there was a further hold up as the fans were moved to the East Stand. The game resumed with no further interruptions. The fire was treated as arson.[1]
On 3 March 2011, the club announced that the corners of the East Stand at the stadium would be filled in to create a further 2,000 spaces made up of seating and terracing for the 2012 season. The stadium capacity, set at 15,000 for the first sell-out home match against St. Helens in 2012, was increased to 15,200 and can grow to 15,693 as the club proves it can handle the bigger crowds and get extra safety certificates. The club has also announced plans to increase the stadium's capacity to around 22,000 should the need arise. The largest ever crowd at the Halliwell Jones was recorded on 14 April 2023, with a record crowd of 15,026 were in attendance.

Brian Bevan monuments[edit]
Statue of Brian Bevan at the Halliwell Jones Stadium
Brian Bevan commemorative mural
Two monuments to Australian winger and world record try scorer Brian Bevan, who played for Warrington 1945–62 (scoring 740 tries for the Wire), are featured at the stadium. One, a statue of him, had previously been placed in the middle of a roundabout (known as Brian Bevan island) close to Wolves' old Wilderspool ground. This was moved to the Halliwell Jones Stadium with the team. The other, a mural showing Bevan's face made from 'Primrose and Blue' bricks, the traditional Warrington colours was created specifically for the location.
Two other tributes to ex-players at the ground are the naming of the South-East quadrant the Jack Fish corner, and the road the stadium is on Mike Gregory Way.

Layout[edit]
North Stand[edit]
The North Stand is the main stand of the ground, housing hospitality, changing rooms and dugout.

East Stand[edit]
Halliwell Jones Stadium
The East Stand is situated behind the goal posts and is an all seater stand with hospitality boxes. In 2011, the corners next to the stand were filled in to increase the capacity.

South Stand[edit]
The South Stand runs along the side of the pitch and is terraced. It also houses the scoreboard and TV gauntry.

West Stand
West Stand[edit]
The West Stand is terraced and houses the away fans. Unlike the East Stand at the opposite end of the ground, the corners are not filled in but there are future plans to do so if there is demand for the capacity to be increased.

Sponsorship[edit]
Halliwell Jones, which holds the naming rights for the stadium, is a large BMW and MINI motor group owned by Phillip Jones, a businessman from the North West.

The Macedonian football champions (Macedonian: Македонски Фудбалски Шампион, Championship: Шампионат, single: "Шампион", plural: Шампиони) are the annual winners of Macedonian First Football League, North Macedonia's premier annual football league competition. The title has been contested since 1929 in varying forms of competition.


History[edit]
In 1923 it was organised the first edition of leagues in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia where, beside the top-level national Yugoslav Football Championship, regional championships were also played.  The clubs of the Vardarska Banovina, territorially similar to present day Macedonia, played within the Belgrade Football Subassociation League until 1927,[1] when a separate Skoplje Football Subassociation League was formed.[2]  The champions of Subassociation Leagues were granted a place in the qualifiers to the Yugoslav Championship, a top national level.  Gragjanski Skopje became the only club to menage to participate in the national league, first in 1935–36 when the championship was played in a cup system,[3] and in 1938–39, when it was played in normal league system with Gragjanski finishing 10th out of 12 teams.[4]  In 1939 the Yugoslav league system was changed, with the creation of separate Serbian and Croato-Slovenian Leagues which will serve as qualifying leagues for the final phase of the Yugoslav Championship.[5]  The clubs from the Skopje Subassociation played their qualifications to the Serbian League, however only Gragjanski managed to participate, and it did it in both occasions, in 1939–40 (5th place)[6] and 1940–41 (8th place).[7]  That became the last season before the beginning of the Second World War in which the region Vardarska Banovina was invaded by Axis allies Albania and Bulgaria.
During the war period, 1941 to 1945, the region became part of Bulgaria, and most of the clubs were incorporated into the Bulgarian league system.  Four seasons were played, in which FK Makedonija, a club from Skopje formed by the Bulgarian authorities by merging the previously existing clubs Gragjanski, SSK Skopje and ŽSK into one, became the most prominent.
After the liberation of Yugoslavia and the creation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia within the socialist Yugoslavia, Macedonian clubs participated in the Yugoslav League system that consisted of two or three, depending on time period, national leagues.  Below the national leagues, the Republic Leagues were created in each one of the 6 Yugoslav Socialist Republics.  The Republic League of SR Macedonia was played between 1945 and 1992, and the top placed teams had access to the Yugoslav national leagues. The most successful clubs from this period were FK Vardar, FK Rabotnički and FK Pobeda, which only don´t count more regional titles because they usually competed in higher national leagues.  In 1992 Macedonia declared independence and formed its own league system.

Royal League[edit]
The clubs from the territory of Vardarska Banovina (belonging to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) had a league organised by the Skoplje Football Subassociation.  The winner had direct access to the Yugoslav Championship.[8]

1929 - Pobeda Skopje
1930 - Jug, SSK and Sparta, all clubs from Skopje, finished the season with eaqual number of points.

Republic League[edit]
In the period between 1945 and 1992 the clubs from SR Macedonia (part of SFR Yugoslavia) competed in the Macedonian Republic League that was part of the Yugoslav league system and corresponded to a 3rd or 4th (depending on period) national tier.
Mostly without the presence of the major clubs that competed at national level (in particular Vardar Skopje).

99 Herculis is the Flamsteed designation for a binary star system in the northern constellation of Hercules. It has the Bayer designation b Herculis, while 99 Herculis is the Flamsteed designation. This system has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.1,[2] which, according to the Bortle scale, makes it faintly visible to the naked eye from suburban skies. Measurements made with the Hipparcos spacecraft show an annual parallax shift of 0.064″,[1] corresponding to a physical distance of about 51.0 ly (15.6 pc) from the Sun. The system is moving further from the Earth with a heliocentric radial velocity of +1.7 km/s.[6]
The binary nature of this star system was first discovered in 1859 by English astronomer W. R. Dawes.[10] The two stellar components orbit around their common center of mass, or barycenter, with a period of 56.3 years and an eccentricity of 0.766. The semi-major axis of their orbit spans an angle of 1.06 arcseconds, which corresponds to a physical dimension of 16.5 AU. The plane of their orbit is inclined by an angle of about 39° to the line-of-sight from the Earth. Reports of a third component of this system now appear doubtful.[5]
The primary component, 99 Herculis A, is an F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F7 V.[4] It has 94%[5] of the Sun's mass and nearly double the luminosity, but has an estimated 10% greater radius.[8] The effective temperature of the star's outer atmosphere is 5,938 K,[4] giving it a white-hued glow.[11] This is a metal-poor star, showing overall abundances of elements—other than hydrogen or helium—equal to 60% of those in the Sun.[12]
The secondary component, 99 Herculis B, is fainter by 3.35 magnitudes compared to the primary. It is a K-type main sequence star with a classification of K4 V.[5] With 46%[5] of the mass of the Sun, it has 74%[8] of the Sun's radius but shines with just 14%[5] of the Sun's luminosity.
Images from the Herschel Space Observatory show that a disk of dusty debris is orbiting the barycenter at an average radius of 120 AU. Oddly, the disk appears to be misaligned with the orbital plane of the binary system. This may be the result of an interaction within another star system some time in the past. Most of the disk emission appears to be caused by icy objects having a diameter of 10 cm or less, with a net mass of about ten times the mass of the Earth.[5]

ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented DBMS (columnar database management system) for online analytical processing (OLAP) that allows users to generate analytical reports using SQL queries in real-time. ClickHouse Inc. is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area with the subsidiary, ClickHouse B.V., based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
In September 2021 in San Francisco, CA, ClickHouse incorporated to house the open source technology with an initial $50 million investment from Index Ventures and Benchmark Capital with participation by Yandex N.V.[2] and others. On October 28, 2021 the company received Series B funding totaling $250 million at a valuation of $2 billion from Coatue Management, Altimeter Capital, and other investors. The company continues to build the open source project and engineering cloud technology.


History[edit]
ClickHouse’s technology was first developed over 10 years ago at Yandex, Russia's largest technology company.[3] In 2009, Alexey Milovidov and developers started an experimental project to check the hypothesis if it was viable to generate analytical reports in real-time from non-aggregated data that is also constantly added in real-time. The developers spent 3 years to prove this hypothesis, and in 2012 ClickHouse launched in production for the first time to power Yandex.Metrica, the second-largest web analytics platform in the world, after Google Analytics.
Unlike custom data structures used before, ClickHouse was applicable more generally to work as a database management system. The power and utility of ClickHouse offered a true column-oriented DBMS, it allowed for systems to generate reports from petabytes of raw data with sub-second latencies. ClickHouse was widely adopted at Yandex including for Yandex.Tank load testing tool and Yandex.Market to monitor site accessibility and KPIs.
In 2016, the ClickHouse project was released as open-source software under the Apache 2 license in June 2016 to power analytical use cases around the globe. The systems at the time offered a server throughput of a hundred thousand rows per second, ClickHouse out performed that speed with a throughput of hundreds of millions of rows per second.
Since ClickHouse became available as open source in 2016, its popularity has grown exponentially, as evidenced through adoption by industry-leading companies like Uber, Comcast, eBay, and Cisco. [4] ClickHouse was also implemented at CERN's LHCb experiment to store and process metadata on 10 billion events with over 1000 attributes per event.

Features[edit]
This section relies excessively on references to primary sources. Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources. Find sources: "ClickHouse" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR (March 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
The main features of the ClickHouse DBMS are:[5]

True column-oriented DBMS. Nothing is stored with the values. For example, constant-length values are supported to avoid storing their length "number" next to the values.
Linear scalability. It's possible to extend a cluster by adding servers.
Fault tolerance. The system is a cluster of shards, where each shard is a group of replicas. ClickHouse uses asynchronous multi-master replication. Data is written to any available replica, then distributed to all the remaining replicas. ZooKeeper is used for coordinating processes, but it's not involved in query processing and execution.
Capability to store and process petabytes of data.
SQL support. ClickHouse supports an extended SQL-like language that includes arrays and nested data structures, approximate and URI functions, and the availability to connect an external key-value store.
High performance.[6]
Vector calculations are used. Data is not only stored by columns, but is processed by vectors (parts of columns). This approach allows it to achieve high CPU performance.
Sampling and approximate calculations are supported.
Parallel and distributed query processing is available (including JOINs).
Data compression.
Hard disk drive (HDD) optimization. The system can process data that doesn't fit in random-access memory (RAM).
Clients for database (DB) connectivity. Database connection options include the console client, the HTTP API, or one of the wrappers (wrappers are available for Python, PHP,[7] NodeJS,[8] Perl,[9] Ruby[10] and R[11]). ODBC driver and JDBC driver are also available for ClickHouse.[12][13]
Limitations[edit]
ClickHouse has some features that can be considered disadvantages:

There is no support for transactions.
Lack of full-fledged UPDATE/DELETE implementation.
Use cases[edit]
ClickHouse was designed for OLAP queries.[5]

It works with a small number of tables that contain a large number of columns.
Queries can use a large number of rows extracted from the DB, but only a small subset of columns.
Queries are relatively rare (usually around 100 RPS per server).
For simple queries, latencies of about 50 ms are allowed.
Column values are fairly small, usually consisting of numbers and short strings (for example, 60 bytes per URL).
High throughput is required when processing a single query (up to billions of rows per second per server).
A query result is mostly filtered or aggregated.
Data update uses a simple scenario (usually batch-only, without complicated transactions).
One of the common cases for ClickHouse is server log analysis. After setting regular data uploads to ClickHouse (it's recommended to insert data in fairly large batches with more than 1000 rows), it's possible to analyze incidents with instant queries or monitor a service's metrics, such as error rates, response times, and so on.
ClickHouse can also be used as an internal data warehouse for in-house analysts. ClickHouse can store data from different systems (such as Hadoop or certain logs) and analysts can build internal dashboards with the data or perform real-time analysis for business purposes.

Benchmark results[edit]
According to benchmark tests conducted by its developers,[6] for OLAP queries ClickHouse is more than 100 times faster than Hive (a DBMS based on the Hadoop technology stack) or MySQL (a common RDBMS).

Franco Carraro (born 6 December 1939) is an Italian sport manager and politician.


Career[edit]
Carraro on the left holding the European Cup with Milan's Gianni Rivera, Nereo Rocco, and Jacopo Castelfranchi [it] in 1969
Carraro was born on 6 December 1939 in Padua, at the time Kingdom of Italy. He worked in many high-profile roles in the public and private sectors. He was the president of the Italian Waterski Federation [it] from 1962 to 1976. That was followed by the presidency of Italian association football club Milan from 1967 to 1971.[1]
In the 1970s, Carraro worked in the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). He was president of Italy's top two football leagues, Serie A and Serie B, from 1973 to 1976, and was president of the FIGC from 1976 to 1978. On 19 May 1978, he resigned to become president of the Italian National Olympic Committee (Italian: Comitato Olimpico Nazionale Italiano, CONI), a role he held until 1987. From 1982 to 2019, Carraro was a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC); per IOC policy, namely an age-limit fixed at 70 years old, except for members between 1966 and 1999, for whom the age limit is 80, Carraro retired in 2019 but remains an honorary member.[2][3]
The 1986 Italian football betting scandal, referred to as Totonero or Totonero bis, created a vacancy that Carraro would accept as the FIGC commissioner from 1986 to 1987. The presidency would follow that of the Italia 90 Committee, the executive committee of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. In 1994, he became president of Impregilo, the biggest pole of Italian construction.[4][5] He was president of the FIGC from 1997 to 2001. He was reelected as president of the FIGC in 2001 and remained in this position until 2006. He was also a member of the UEFA executive board from 2004 to 2009.[6][7]
After Maurizio Beretta [it] left the Lega Serie A presidency to work for UniCredit in 2011, Carraro was thought as a possible successor in what would be his first football role since Calciopoli. He was immediately opposed by smaller Serie A clubs.[8] A return to the presidency of the Major Risks Commission under then-FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio was rumoured in 2015. Nicknamed poltronissimo for the many positions held in his career, Carraro was described by journalist Franco Rossi [it] thusly: "In the whole world, after Fidel Castro, Carraro is the person who has been in power the longest."[9] In 2021, he was reelected president of the Paralympic and Experimental Football Division [it]'s board of directors.[10]

Sport scandals and controversies[edit]
In 2001, the year he was elected FIGC president,[11] Carraro refused to put Inter Milan on trial for the Passaportopoli [it] scandal, which also involved other Serie A clubs. Lawyer Eduardo Chiacchio said: "In 2001 there was the scandal of false passports, above all that of Recoba. By the rules, Inter had to have a point-deduction for each match played with the Uruguayan player on the pitch. [Napoli president] Ferlaino asked me to take action because Moratti's Inter could be given 23 penalty points and so it was Inter and not Napoli which would be relegated."[12] As the 2000–01 Serie A was over, the decision was on Carraro, who did not want to put Inter on trial.[13] Chiacchio added that "Inter was saved because no one had the courage to appeal to justice. Calciopoli was just the tip of the iceberg."[14]
Carraro was president of Mediobanca, which was owned by Capitalia and was a major investor in Serie A clubs, particularly Lazio, Parma, and Roma;[15] Lazio and Roma went on to win the 2000 and 2001 Serie A leagues to Juventus' disadvantage. He was accused of conflict of interest, as he was co-owner of Lazio and Roma through his control of Capitalia, charges he dismissed.[16][17] In 2006, it emerged that Carraro was involved in Calciopoli, the 2006 Italian football scandal,[18][19][20] which led to his resignation;[21][22] he remained on the UEFA's executive committee and as a FIFA official.[23][24] He denied any wrongdoing and said he resigned in the interest of football.[25][nb 1] Charged of being part of a criminal association to steer the 2004–05 Serie A, he was acquitted in 2008.[27] In May 2009, he was acquitted of sporting fraud due to lack of evidence.[28][29]
In one telephone tapping ahead of the 2004–05 Serie A match between Inter Milan, which would benefit with the scudetto of the league at the time of the scandal but were later charged of Article 6 warrating relegation when it was time-barred by the statute of limitations,[30] and Juventus, the sole club to be controversially relegated to Serie B,[31][nb 2] Carraro asked referee designator Paolo Bergamo to avoid any favour for Juventus if in doubt.[nb 3] On the matchday, Bergamo told referee Pasquale Rodomonti [it] to favour Inter Milan when in doubt;[nb 4] the match, which ended 2–2, saw an error favouring Inter Milan.[36][nb 5] In his deposition,[nb 6] Carraro testified he said that because he was aware that any mistake, no matter if in good faith, favouring Juventus would cause controversy, whereas errors that disadvantaged or penalized Juventus would cause no controversy; he wanted to avoid controversy because the match came ahead of the Italian football elections.[37] In another intercepted phone call with Bergamo, Carraro declared that Fiorentina and Lazio must be helped to avoid their relegation to Serie B. His original prison sentence was 4 years and 6 months but was later replaced by a fine of €80,000,[38] which was controversial.[39][40][41]
In the 2010s, Carraro expressed his criticism of the scudetto awarded to Inter Milan, especially because, as he recalled, "a month later Rossi goes to be president of Telecom for the second time, whose largest shareholder is Marco Tronchetti Provera, vice-president of Inter."[42] He also said that Juventus were the best team and had legitimately won on the pitch.[43][44] In 2020, he stated that the only thing he blamed himself for Calciopoli was not having substituted Bergamo and Pierluigi Pairetto earlier with Pierluigi Collina as referee designator, and reiterated that Juventus would still have won had the scandal not happened because they were the best team.[45]

Politics[edit]
Carraro in 1992
As a member of the Italian Socialist Party, Carraro was the Italian minister of tourism in Giovanni Goria, Ciriaco De Mita, and Giulio Andreotti's Christian Democracy-led pentapartito governments of 1987–1991, and he was the mayor of Rome from 1989 to 1993 after being elected by the city's council.[46] In his mayoral campaign, he was supported by actor Carlo Verdone and journalist Giuliano Ferrara.[47][48]
In the 2000s and 2010s, Carraro was part of The People of Freedom,[49][50] and then joined the refounded Forza Italia,[51] the centre-right coalition political parties of Silvio Berlusconi,[52] former Prime Minister of Italy and chairman of Milan, a club that he said he continues to sympathize with. In the 2020s, he remained politically close to Berlusconi.[1] A member of the Senate of the Republic first elected in the 2013 Italian general election for Forza Italia, Carraro was not among the party list's candidates for the 2018 Italian general election.[53]

In popular culture[edit]
Carraro is the protagonist of Rome's ska-punk bank Banda Bassotti in the song "Carraro sindaco", whose text is used as criticism against him for the way he handles the city of Rome as mayor and for the possession of several houses donated to his buoi.[54][55]

Che bravo sindaco, quanta civiltà. Con i manganelli amministra la città ... Carraro sindaco, non temere, non temere. Noi non vogliamo rubarti da mangiare. Vogliamo una casa per abitare con la luce e l'acqua come ce l'avete voi, cioè come ce l'hanno i segretari tuoi, i guardiaspalle tuoi, i poliziotti tuoi, i tuoi buoi![56]— Italian refrain
What a good mayor, what a civilization. With batons he administers the city ... Mayor Carraro, fear not, fear not. We will not steal food. We want to live in a house with light and water as you have it, that is, as your secretaries, your bodyguards, your policemen, your cattle!— English refrain
Explanatory notes and quotes[edit]


^ In his resignation letter, Carraro wrote: I remember that we have always respected the rules. There was only one exception in the summer of 2003 when we decided to expand the Serie B squad by forcing the regulatory procedures. It was a painful decision, "the lesser of two evils" given the climate that had arisen and of the indispensability of starting the championships on the scheduled dates. An extraordinary decision permitted by a state law and approved by CONI. Faced with a serious and painful affair such as the one that arises from the material sent to us by the Turin Public Prosecutor's Office and in the face of the developments that could arise from the ongoing investigations by the Rome and Naples Public Prosecutor's Offices, I do not think that the football world can afford that some insiders and some representatives of public opinion discuss the advisability of the Federal President continuing to exercise his functions. The commitments of the [Italian Football] Federation in the coming days and months are such and so many that a federal summit is needed in full capacity and concentrated on them.[26]

^ The background context for the match goes back to three weeks before, when the Reggina–Juventus match saw two missed penalties and a regular goal annulled to Juventus' disadvantage. In response, Juventus managing director Luciano Moggi, who was later charged by the prosecution as part of the Calciopoli scandal of forming a criminal association with Carraro, among others, told in a phone call that he had closed the match's referee, Gianluca Paparesta, in the locker room as punishment, something that was later revealed to be Moggi's bravado and boastfulness; the court ruled that the event did not happen and the charge of kidnapping was dismissed. Paparesta was one of the referees available for the match's grid, which were selected through a draft, along with Paolo Bertini [it], Pierluigi Collina, Stefano Farina, and Pasquale Rodomonti [it]. Heading into the match, Inter Milan chairman Giacinto Facchetti had phone conversations with members of the refeering world. Facchetti called referee assistant designator Gennaro Mazzei on 25 November, and expressed doubts about Bertini and his preference for Collina as referee for the match in a call with Paolo Bergamo, manager and designator of referees, on 26 November, two days before the match. In addition, there were Lega Calcio elections the day after the match.[32]

^ Transcription of the phone call:[32]Carraro: Who's there, at Juventus...Bergamo: Rodomonti... Inter–Juventus...Carraro: Please that he doesn't help Juventus, for God's sake, which is a very delicate match in a very delicate moment in Lega [Calcio], etc., for God's sake, that he doesn't help Juventus, that he lets them play an honest match for heaven's sake, but that he doesn't make mistakes in favour of Juventus please...Bergamo: ... don't worry, I'll talk to him tomorrow morning when he trains so that his head stays freshCarraro: He has to referee the match correctly but that he doesn't make mistakes for goodness sake in favour of Juventus because otherwise it would be a disaster, in shortBergamo: In any case, he hasn't refereed Juventus for a long time, doctor, we put him in precisely because it's been two-three years, so no, no... he was one of those who...Carraro: Look, I'm not interested, in the sense that... if Collina was there, even if he made a mistake, no one says shit but... Rodomonti, if he makes a mistake in favour of Juventus, God's wrath ensues, since then there's... since keep in mind that it is played on Sunday evening, on Monday there is the election of Lega [Calcio] etc ... it would be disastrous stuff, in short...Bergamo: It is my concern to talk to him tomorrow, doctorCarraro: All right, don't forget, thank you, goodbye About this phone call, the motivations of the first instance sentence of the ordinary judgment read: "We have also already mentioned the lack of sense of responsibility shown [by Bergamo] ... as well as the submissive behavior shown by Bergamo by telephone on 26/11/04 with Carraro, who suggested him that he gives the absurd suggestion to the referee not to make a mistake in favour of one team, a suggestion which, if sent to the referee, could also have been interpreted as a message to favour the other team."[32]

^ Transcription of the phone call:[32]Bergamo: Don't forget Pasquale because you struggled to get there, to return there, and therefore I expect, believe me, that you won't miss anything, nothing, for anyone...Rodomonti: I'm immensely pleased with what you said because it's the truthBergamo: Above all, there's a difference between the teams of 15 points, understood, so also prepare well psychologically... you must not question the efforts you've endured... so referee your match, there is none for anyone, so... if I tell you mine right now if you have a doubt think more about who is behind rather than who is in frontRodomonti: All right, all rightBergamo: Listen to me, it's something that remains between you and me...Rodomonti: On my word, thank you, don't worryBergamo: Because getting up there you know how tiring it is, going back down... it would be really stupid for you...Rodomonti: All rightBergamo: Be an intelligent person... it stays between you and me, I hopeRodomonti: Don't worry A few minutes later, Bergamo contacted the FIGC's secretary Maria Grazia Fazi to inform her that he has spoken to Rodomonti, telling her "the matter is not clear, [it is] more than clear... more than clear." While the phone call involving Carraro was present in the investigative reports of the Carabinieri, the one involving Bergamo and Rodomonti was not contained in any report and was made public, among many others as part of the Calciopoli bis developments in the 2010s,[33][34] by Moggi's defence.[32] It was first listened in a Gold TV broadcast on 14 April 2010.[35]

^ Transcription of the phone call:[32]Collina: Paolo, hi, I was calling you back on your home number.Bergamo: Ah, you called me, yes indeed...Collina: ... well it seems to me, apart from that, how does Toldo seem to you? In my opinion it was full red, really full red [card]... but you know I understand that it's not easy, but it seems to me good for the restBergamo: The other episode, that of Adriano is nothing because he pushed first...Collina: No, there's nothing, he was right to whistle like that too... now let's hope that whoever makes the comments later in the broadcasts...Bergamo: In fact, Gigi called me... because he immediately gets scared, however... let's wait for the comments, in short, because we'll talk to each other as best we believe, in conclusion...Collina: Yes, no it's red there, it's full red there, it's really full red In an interview to La Gazzetta dello Sport, Bergamo defended Rodomonti's choice of not having sent off the Inter Milan goalkeeper; in private, he disagreed. In a phone call with fellow referee designator Pierluigi Pairetto, he admitted that Toldo should have received a red card. In a phone call between Pairetto and referee Roberto Rosetti on 30 November, two days after the match, both agreed that Rodomonti had made a mistake.[32]

^ Transcription of Carraro's deposition:[32]PM: Mr. Carraro, would you comment on the phone call? This is my question.Carraro: The logic of my phone call is simple, Collina as referee was a referee considered by everyone above the parties, and considered among the best referees in the world, when Collina made a mistake everyone assumed good faith, when a referee like Rodomonti refereed, that he was certainly a good referee but not with the external "credibility" of a Collina, with the fame, with the reputation of Collina, every error was considered almost as the result of something that was not accidental, or that could not be accidental, so I say "don't forget, it's a very delicate match." The following day there was the election of the president of Lega calcio, which is an election that didn't concern me directly, but since all the clubs would have met the day after for this election, if the outcome of the Juventus–Inter match had it been an outcome in which a referee error had been decisive, according to public opinion, in the result of the match itself, the controversies would have multiplied by 6.28 because all the presidents would have been questioned, each one would have had his say, etc. etc. this was the spirit of my phone call.PM: So, according to your assessment, the one you express clearly in the conversation with Bergamo, instead you absolutely didn't take into consideration that Rodomonti could indeed make mistakes during the match but in favour of the other team, Inter?Carraro: A referee can always make mistakes, the more important a match is, the more delicate it is, the more it is followed by the public, the more the referee's mistake occurs, especially in Italy because abroad it is not like that, [so] emphasized. I repeat, Collina at that time had a national and international prestige which meant that, even if he was wrong, public opinion accepted the mistake. One is a very reputed chef, he makes a wrong dish, people say 'oh well, it means he just made a mistake.' Rodomonti is a lower-level chef, despite being an excellent chef, if he makes a mistake people say 'then this guy is incapable', or 'he wanted to cook not well', this is the meaning of my call.President Casoria: But the public prosecutor asked why you were worried that Rodomonti made mistakes in favour of Juventus and not Inter?PM: Why didn't you worry about him not making mistakes absolutely?Carraro: Because the media, in general, of the time, written press, radio, television... in general public opinion, Juventus was a "very powerful" club, [while] Inter was considered, at that time, less authoritative in terms of sport politics, for which an error in favour of Inter was considered a mistake, an error in favour of Juventus would have led to a reaction of public opinion. This is what it seemed to me to be, because I always talk about my personal feelings. At the time, this phone call involving Carraro was read and understood by the investigators in a colpevolisti ("guilty") stance, namely that even Carraro, as the FIGC president, was aware of a criminal association to fix matches, a charge by the prosecution that Carraro rejected in his deposition, and instead discussed of an unequal treatment in media reactions to Juventus' disadvantage.[32]

Retrieved 8 February 2023 – via Google Books. The former president of the FIGC, Franco Carraro, was a former Mayor of Rome, deputy for the PSI and Tourism Minister in the 1980s. He was also president of MCC, a merchant bank owned by Capitalia. This bank was the major investor in a number of Serie A clubs, in particular, Roma, Parma and Lazio. The financial underwriting of Capitalia permitted a number of clubs to operate despite accruing considerable debt. The president of the FIGC is also overseer of Covisoc, the financial regulator for the league. In this position the president has a duty to maintain the financial probity and integrity of the league. However, this was compromised through Carraro's involvement with an organization that underwrites certain clubs' debts. Consequently, patrimonial networks are entrenched in a small number of dense family and personal connections.

Inter, which were awarded the 2006 league revoked from Juventus, violated Article 6 of the Sports Justice Code, the one about illicits. This is the conviction expressed by the [FIGC's] federal prosecutor, Stefano Palazzi, in the conclusions attached to the device on the open investigation 'as soon as we have received news of the new facts that have emerged and therefore before the complaint presented by Juventus ... The facts are lapsed, but the statute of limitations can be waived', confirms the federal prosecutor.

^ Ingram, Sam (20 December 2021). "Calciopoli Scandal: Referee Designators As Desired Pawns". ZicoBall. Archived from the original on 10 December 2022. Retrieved 29 January 2023. FIGC's actions in relegating Juventus and handing the title to Inter Milan were somewhat peculiar. Of course, Moggi and Juventus deserved punishment; that is not up for dispute. However, the severity of the ruling and the new location for the Scudetto was unprecedented and arguably should never have happened. The final ruling in the Calciopoli years later judged that Juventus had never breached article 6. As a result, the Serie A champions should never have encountered a shock 1–1 draw away to Rimini in the season's curtain-raiser. Nor should they have trounced Piacenza 4–0 in Turin or handed a 5–1 thrashing away to Arezzo in Tuscany. The findings stated that some club officials had violated article 6, but none had originated from Juventus. FIGC created a structured article violation with their decision-making. This means that instead of finding an article 6 breach, several article 1 violations were pieced together to create evidence damning to warrant relegation from Italy's top flight. Article 1 violations in Italian football usually command fines, bans, or points deductions, but certainly not relegation.

One between Bergamo and Collina, the other between Pairetto and Rosetti. All four agree on the fact that on the episode of [Juventus'] Zalayeta's penalty it would have been more appropriate to send [Inter Milan goalkeeper] Toldo off, rather than warn him, as Rodomonti did instead. Perhaps the referee remembered what Bergamo said to him: if you have a doubt... think more about who is behind [Inter Milan] rather than who is in front... [Juventus] ... .

^ Arpino, Felix (29 January 2018), "Calciopoli: l'imputazione che non c'è", Il calcio è uguale per tutti (in Italian), ... Carraro underlines that the match must be regular and correct but repeats several times that it is essential, due to the imminent votes in Lega Calcio, that there are no refereeing errors in favour of Juventus. It was therefore important, in order for 'ally' Galliani to be elected in Lega [Calcio], to avoid post-match controversies that could have undermined the serenity of the election. Carraro makes these recommendations to Bergamo because he knows that Juventus was being helped (and was therefore aware of the criminal association that would steer the league) or, instead, because he was aware of the different media reaction that occurs following an error [favouring] Juventus?  ... The meaning of the phone call was then explained by Carraro himself, [and] aimed at avoiding the possibility that there could be problems of a media nature (problems which, according to the federal president, would have occurred only in the case of favouritism to Juve while in the case of aid to Inter there would have been no relevant media reaction, precisely because of that unequal treatment which, in my opinion, is perceptible even today). If Carraro had been aware of Moggi's criminal association or of a bias of Rodomonti, he could and should have (he was under oath) said so, instead he speaks of something else altogether.

Marcel Le Roy (26 October 1919 – 21 April 2020) was a French Resistance member.[1] He served as Mayor of Niort-la-Fontaine, and then General Councillor of the Canton of Lassay-les-Châteaux from 1962 to 1994. He was first a member of the Union for the New Republic, then the Union of Democrats for the Republic, and lastly, the Rally for the Republic.

Biography[edit]
At the start of World War II, Le Roy joined the French Air Force, where he became a radio technician. Following the Battle of France, he tried to join England in the war efforts, but he was denied. He then went to Marseille, where he tried and failed to join Free France. He was then contacted by Jean Le Roux, the main transmitter of the Réseau Johnny.
He joined the network in 1941 with the mission of addressing the public on the Occupation. He was taken prisoner on 16 February 1942 in Quimper. He escaped, but was again captured three days later.
He was imprisoned in Angers, Fresnes, and Fort de Romainville. Le Roy was deported to Natzweiler-Struthof in July 1943, then to Kommando d'Erringen, and lastly to Dachau. He was freed on 30 April 1945 from Allach.

Tor Albert Miller (born February 7, 1994) is an indie pop singer from Brooklyn, New York City.


History[edit]
Originally from Brooklyn, New York, Miller moved with his mother to New Jersey after a brief separation of his parents, although his school was still located in the city. To counter the boredom during the long drive, Miller's mother gave him albums to listen during the commute, including David Bowie, Elton John and Fleetwood Mac, which sparked his interest in music.  "Ziggy Stardust, Elton John’s Greatest Hits, and Rumours by Fleetwood Mac, so I just listened to those non-stop, back and forth, all the time."[2][3]
He started to play piano after his parents set up a lesson with a piano teacher who he said was, "a laid-back New Jersey wedding singer". From there, Miller started to develop singing and writing songs. During his high school, he started a pop punk band. When he was 18 years old, Tor Miller went to New York University, specifically Clive Davis School of Recorded Music. He also spent his weekends playing piano at places such as Rockwood Music Hall, The Bitter End,[4] and the burlesque bar, Slipper Room in the East Village.[2][3][5]
Miller was signed to the independent label, Glassnote Records in early 2014[6][7] and subsequently dropped out from NYU due to scheduling problems (especially since he played music in a number of NYC venues). His debut EP, Headlights EP, containing four songs that includes the positively reviewed "Midnight"[8][9] was released in February 2015.[10][11] His debut album American English, was released on September 30, 2016.[12]
Following the release of his second album Surviving The Suburbs, Miller became an independent artist[13] and released his third album, Generation of Me on June 9, 2022.[14] He currently manages trans hyperpop artist Mel 4Ever.[15]

Willem Werner Hubert "Willy" Claes[1] (Dutch: [ˈʋɪli klaːs]; born 24 November 1938) is a Belgian politician who served as the eighth Secretary General of NATO, from 1994 to 1995. Claes was forced to resign from his NATO position after he was found guilty of corruption, which was uncovered during the investigation into André Cools' death. Claes was a member of the Flemish Socialist Party.
Claes was born in Hasselt, Belgium. He graduated in political and diplomatic sciences at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).


Political career[edit]
Claes began his political career in the Hasselt city council. In 1968, he was elected to the national parliament. In 1972, he entered the cabinet for the first time as minister of education. Between 1973 and 1992, he was minister of economic affairs of Belgium three separate times. He also served as deputy prime minister five times, and was an important negotiator in the formation of coalition governments during the 1980s.
Claes was Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1992 until 1994, during which period he presided over Belgium's withdrawal from the UN peacekeeping mission in Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide. Belgium's withdrawal is thought[by whom?] to have dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, leading to thousands of deaths.[citation needed]
Claes was also Secretary General of NATO from 1994 until 1995, when he resigned after the discovery of a bribe of over 50 million Belgian francs (BEF), accepted at the time he was minister of economic affairs and connected to the defence contract negotiations with Agusta and Dassault. A criminal trial was handled by the Court of Cassation, which is responsible for cases involving minister in function. Claes received a 60 000 BEF fine, a three-year probationary sentence and a five-year prohibition on running for public office. An appeal at the European Court of Human Rights resulted in the confirmation of the Belgian sentence.

Musical career[edit]
Claes is known for being a pianist and has frequently performed concerts. Even as secretary-general of the N.A.T.O., he had a piano in his residence to keep in practice. [2]

Honours[edit]
Minister of State
Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold II.[3]

The Iarnród Éireann 8200 Class electric multiple units were built for the Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART). The units were two-car sets, of which there were five. They were numbered in the sequence 820X+840X. 820X units are power cars while 840X units are unpowered driving trailers.


History[edit]
The units first entered service in 2000. The units had operated in multiple with the 8500 and 8510 classes.
The five members of this class spent long periods out of service, the most recent being from summer 2007 until March 2008. Following a brief return to service of all coaches with the exception of 8204/8404, all units were withdrawn from service yet again, with Iarnród Éireann citing frequent breakdowns and small seating as their reason for early withdrawal.[citation needed] They were stabled in Fairview DART depot during these periods of being out of service.  In 2012 the units were  tendered for sale, but were not sold.[citation needed]
They remain decommissioned at Inchicore Works, clear of catenary until reportedly around October 2023, where 8201 and 8401 were scrapped and stripped of its parts.[as of?]
A sectioned-off 8401 has now been moved to NTA's Wayfinding Centre in Glasnevin, Dublin.[1]

Waterway[edit]
Thycattusserry lies between the Kottapuram-Kollam National Inland Waterway passing through the Vembanad lake. Prior to the coming of NH-47 the cargo and freight from Cochin market was transported in country boats through the Vembanad lake via the small lake diverting from Arukutty-Kudapuram-Ulavaipu[Kaithappuzha Lake].

Companions of Xanth is an adventure game published in 1993 by Legend Entertainment.


Gameplay[edit]
The game is based on Piers Anthony's Xanth novels and loosely follows the plot of his 1993 novel Demons Don't Dream, in which a young man uses a computer game to enter and explore the world of Xanth.
Typical of Piers Anthony's novels, the game is filled with puns and visual gags, and some knowledge of the Xanth universe is helpful; for those players who haven't read any of the Xanth novels, an in-game 'Com-Pendium of Xanth' is provided to the player for the majority of the game. The game uses 2D graphics in 8-bit colour and was available on both floppy disk and CD-ROM.
The game was re-released in July 1997 in a bundle with Legend Entertainment's Death Gate and Shannara.[2]

Reception[edit]
Computer Gaming World stated in February 1994 that Companions of Xanth was "a very funny game based on an interesting literary license", with "traditional adventure game puzzles".[3] The magazine's Scorpia was less positive in March 1994, criticizing the forced choice of Nada Naga as a Companion, puzzle quality ("uneven at best, and in some cases, downright poor"), and short playing time. She concluded that Companions of Xanth was "the weakest Legend game to date".[4] In August 1994 the magazine said that Xanth "was somewhat weak as a game, but full of Piers Anthony-style humor".[5] The game was reviewed in 1994 in Dragon #204 by Sandy Petersen in the "Eye of the Monitor" column. Petersen gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.[6]

Sheldon Clark High School (SCHS) was a public high school in unincorporated Martin County, Kentucky, USA, near Inez.[2] It was a part of the Martin County School System.
It was named after Martin County Schools Superintendent Sheldon Clark when both Warfield High School and Inez High School was consolidated in 1972. As of 2017[update] Martha Williams is the principal.[3] The original Sheldon Clark High School building had to be abandoned after nearby road construction blasting resulted in structural damage, with the school then being housed in a middle school building until a new high school could be built.[4] Construction of the new school, Martin County High School, started in 2016 with the school opening for the 2019–2020 school year.[5][6][7]

Plot[edit]
In this series, which picks up immediately after the climactic battle of the original series, the bodies of Ogami Itto and Yagyu Retsudo are left lying on the battlefield with Daigoro left alone standing over his father's body (since no one, for political reasons, dares to bury either body or take charge of Daigoro). A bearded samurai, Tōgō Shigetada of the Satsuma clan and master of the Jigen-ryū style of swordsmanship (based on the actual historical personage Tōgō Shigetaka, creator of Jigen-ryū), wanders onto the battlefield and assists Daigoro with the cremation/funeral of Ogami Itto and Yagyu Retsudo. Tōgō, who is on a training journey and also carries a dotanuki sword similar to Ogami's (and crafted by the same swordsmith), then assumes guardianship of Daigoro, including retrieving the baby cart and teaching/training Daigoro in Jigen-ryū.
The two soon become enmeshed in a plot by the Shogunate conceived by the ruthless Matsudaira Nobutsuna and spearheaded by his chief henchman Mamiya Rinzō (also based on an actual historical character) to topple the Satsuma clan and assume control of that fiefdom's great wealth, using Tōgō as an unwitting pawn. When Tōgō discovers that he has been tricked and used, he and Daigoro embark on the road of meifumado in a quest to kill the Shogun (which would force Matsudaira out into the open). However, Rinzō, who is not only a master of disguise but also Matsudaira's natural son, may have an even more devious plan of his own, including subverting the Shogun's own ninja and using opium to ensnare and enslave the Shogun himself.

Thomas W. Luce IIIAssistant Secretary of EducationIn office2005–2006PresidentGeorge W. Bush
Personal detailsBornDallas, Texas, U.S.
Thomas W. Luce III is an American lawyer, government official, non-profit executive, and former advisor to H. Ross Perot. He is CEO of Biotech Initiatives at Lyda Hill Philanthropies.[1]


Early life and education[edit]
Thomas W. Luce III was born in Dallas, Texas, where he was raised by a single mother.[2] He attended public schools in Highland Park Independent School District.[3]
He received an athletic scholarship to Virginia Military Institute but transferred to Southern Methodist University where he earned a B.B.A. in 1962 and a J.D. from the Dedman School of Law in 1966.[2][4]

Spirit of Texas[edit]
In 1982, Ross Perot Jr. and co-pilot Jay Coburn completed the first round-the-world flight in a helicopter, the Spirit of Texas. Tom Luce helped facilitate the achievement by arranging for a container ship to carry a shipping container filled with jet fuel into the middle of the Pacific Ocean to serve as a refueling station.[5]

Purchase of Magna Carta[edit]
In 1984, Luce handled negotiations for a purchase of a 700-year-old copy of Magna Carta by Ross Perot.[6] He brought the document to the United States wrapped in brown shipping paper and stowed in the coat closet across from his seat on a commercial American Airlines flight.[7]

Political activities[edit]
1990 Texas gubernatorial race[edit]
Luce ran for Governor of Texas as one of several Republicans looking to succeed outgoing Governor Bill Clements.[8] He placed third in the Republican primary with 115,835 votes.[9]

H. Ross Perot presidential campaign[edit]
A long-time advisor to Perot, Luce was the chairman of his campaign for President of the United States in 1992.[2][10]

Public service[edit]
George W. Bush administration[edit]
President Bush nominated Luce to the position of assistant secretary for the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development at the U.S. Department of Education on May 20, 2005, and the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment to this position on July 1, 2005.[11]

State of Texas[edit]
Luce was appointed to major posts by Texas governors five times, including as chief justice pro tempore of the Supreme Court of Texas, as well as posts on the Sunset Advisory Commission and the Superconducting Super Collider Commission.[12] In 2012, Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives Joe Straus appointed Luce to the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Oversight Committee.[13]

Nonprofit leadership[edit]
In addition to his legal career and public service, Luce has founded and led a number of nonprofit organizations including the National Math and Science Initiative and the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.[14][15]
Most recently, Luce founded the state policy think tank Texas 2036, "a nonpartisan 501c3 nonprofit that hopes to use data and research to drive the planning and policy Texans will need to address challenges impacting [the] state's future."[16]

Honors[edit]
In 2012, U.S. News & World Report inducted Luce into the U.S. News STEM Leadership Hall of Fame.[17]
Luce was recognized and honored by Republican Congressman Lamar Smith on the floor of the United States House of Representatives in 2012 "for his years of leadership and contributions to improving our public schools, strengthening higher education and supporting business and economic growth," and in 2015 by Democratic Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson for his role in education reform in Texas.[18][19]
In 2015, Sarah Fullinwider Perot and Ross Perot Jr. donated $1.75 million to endow the Thomas W. Luce, III Centennial Dedman Law Scholars Program at SMU.[20]
In 2018, he was awarded the 2018 Linz Award, an annual honor recognizing enduring civic or humanitarian efforts benefiting Dallas.[21]
In 2021, Luce was inducted into the Dallas Business Hall of Fame.[22]

Working-class culture is a range of cultures created by or popular among working-class people. The cultures can be contrasted with high culture and folk culture, and are often equated with popular culture and low culture (the counterpart of high culture). Working-class culture developed during the Industrial Revolution. Because most of the newly created working class were former peasants, the cultures took on much of the localised folk culture. This was soon altered by the changed conditions of social relationships and the increased mobility of the workforce and later by the marketing of mass-produced cultural artefacts such as prints and ornaments and commercial entertainment such as music hall and cinema.
In academia, working-class socio-economic circumstances are conventionally associated with alcoholism,[1] domestic abuse,[2] obesity[3] and delinquency.[4]


Politics of working-class culture[edit]
Many socialists with a class struggle viewpoint see working-class culture as a vital element of the proletariat which they champion. One of the first organisations for proletarian culture was Proletkult, founded in Russia shortly after the February Revolution, supported by Alexander Bogdanov, who had been co-leader of the Bolsheviks with Vladimir Lenin. The group included both Bolsheviks and their critics, and Bogdanov struggled to retain its independence following the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917. His erstwhile ally Anatoly Lunacharsky had rejoined the Bolsheviks and was appointed Commissar for Education. 
In Literature and Revolution, Trotsky examined aesthetic issues in relation to class and the Russian revolution. Soviet scholar Robert Bird considered his work as the "first systematic treatment of art by a Communist leader" and a catalyst for later, Marxist cultural and critical theories.[5] Trotsky presented a critique of contemporary literary movements such as Futurism and emphasised a need of cultural autonomy for the development of a socialist culture. According to literary critic Terry Eagleton, Trotsky recognised “like Lenin on the need for a socialist culture to absorb the finest products of bourgeois art”.[6] Trotsky himself viewed the proletarian culture as “temporary and transitional” which would provide the foundations for a culture above classes. He also argued that the pre-conditions for artistic creativity were economic well-being and emancipation from material constraints.[7] Political scientist Baruch Knei-Paz characterised his view on the role of the party as transmitters of culture to the masses and raising the standards of education, as well as entry into the cultural sphere, but that the process of artistic creation in terms of language and presentation should be the domain of the practitioner. Knei-Paz also noted key distinctions between Trotsky’s approach on cultural matters and Stalin's policy in the 1930s.[8]
Marxist–Leninist states have declared an official working-class culture, most notably socialist realism, whose constant aim is to glorify the worker, in contrast to typical independent working-class cultures. However, Lenin believed that there could be no authentic proletarian culture free from capitalism and that high culture should be brought to the workers. 
The millenarian nature of socialist working-class art is evident in the goals espoused by the leaders of revolutionary movements. The art forms for the masses were meant to shape a new consciousness and form the basis of a new culture and new man.[9]
Many Americans strongly believe the U.S. is a "Land of Opportunity" that offers every child an equal chance at social and economic mobility.  The idea of Americans rising from humble origins to riches has been called a "civil religion",[10] "the bedrock upon which the American story has been anchored",[11] and part of the American identity (the American Dream[12]) This theme is celebrated in the lives of famous Americans such as Benjamin Franklin and Henry Ford,[10] and in popular culture (from the books of Horatio Alger and Norman Vincent Peale to the song "Movin' on Up"[13]).
The American Dream Report, a study of the Economic Mobility Project, found that Americans surveyed were more likely than citizens of other countries to agree with statements like:

"People get rewarded for intelligence and skill",
"People get rewarded for their efforts";
and less likely to agree with statements like:

"Coming from a wealthy family is 'essential' or 'very important' to getting ahead,"
"Income differences in my country are too large" or
"It is the responsibility of government to reduce differences in income."[14]
In the US only 32% of respondents agreed with the statement that forces beyond their personal control determine their success.  In contrast, a majority of European respondents agreed with this view in every country but three (Britain, the Czech Republic and Slovakia).[15] The Brookings Institution found Americans surveyed had the highest belief in meritocracy—69% agreed with the statement "people are rewarded for intelligence and skill"—among 27 nations surveyed.[16]
Another report found such beliefs to have gotten stronger over the last few decades.[17]

Working-class cultures are extremely geographically diverse, leading some to question whether they have anything in common. In the United States, working-class culture has been portrayed on TV shows such as Roseanne, Good Times, Married...With Children, All in the Family, Family Guy, The Simpsons, and South Park, in which American families struggle with day-to-day working life. A variant of US working-class culture is Southern culture, as depicted in TV shows such as The Dukes of Hazzard, King of the Hill or The Beverly Hillbillies. While American soap operas deal with the lifestyles of the middle and upper classes, in the United Kingdom they are the opposite: shows such as Coronation Street, Brookside and EastEnders deal with the struggles of working-class life in their respective settings: Weatherfield (a thinly veiled Salford), Liverpool and Walford (commonly associated with Bromley-by-Bow). Another example is Shameless, which highlights working-class life in Stretford, a Manchester suburb, as does its American adaptation set in Chicago. TV shows such as Regular Show and Beavis and Butthead portray working-class friends. SpongeBob SquarePants, Bob the Builder, and Handy Manny are very well-known TV shows featuring working-class titular characters. Happy Tree Friends has a working-class beaver character named Handy. One of Australian pub rock singer Jimmy Barnes' more popular songs, "Working Class Man" references working-class culture and hardships.
Along with lad culture in the United Kingdom, some youth subcultures such as skinheads, mods, punks, rockers and metalheads have been associated with working-class culture. In the United States, some White Americans have reclaimed the usually derogatory term redneck as an identifier with working-class White Americans. Many may deliberately embrace redneck stereotypes but choose to avoid usage of the word due to its frequent association with negative attitudes such as racism. Jeff Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour are among the most popularized examples of redneck culture being embraced with humor. Many Irish, French, Mediterranean, Italian, Latin American and Eastern European communities within the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand are also identifiers of working-class culture. Similarly to rednecks, they also often embrace themselves. Some sports such as rugby league football, darts and association football, which is sometimes referred to as the working man's game, are associated with the working class in the United Kingdom. In the United States, ten-pin bowling, American football, basketball and baseball are associated with the working class.

On 31 December 2017 at about 3:15 pm AEDT (UTC+11:00), a de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver configured as a floatplane crashed into Jerusalem Bay off Cowan Creek,[1] on the northern outskirts of Sydney, Australia. The aircraft, operated by Sydney Seaplanes, was carrying five passengers and a pilot, all of whom were killed in the crash. It was returning diners from Cottage Point Inn restaurant to Rose Bay Water Airport.[2][3]
The ATSB believes it probable that the pilot's performance was adversely affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. Post mortem tests on the bodies of the victims showed raised levels of CO in the blood, and a crack in the exhaust system was seen as the likely source of the gas.[4][5]


Aircraft[edit]
The aircraft was a 54-year-old de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, originally built in 1963 and registered in Australia since February 1964; it was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior engine.[6]
In 1996, the aircraft was destroyed in a crash while working as a crop duster near Armidale, New South Wales, killing the pilot. The aircraft was then completely rebuilt; the Civil Aviation Safety Authority confirmed that it had been repaired according to industry requirements.[7]

Victims[edit]
The Canadian-Australian pilot, Gareth Morgan (44)[8] and five British tourists – Richard Cousins (58), CEO of British foodservice company Compass Group, his two sons, his fiancée[9] and her daughter – were killed in the crash.[10][11]

Investigation[edit]
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) opened an investigation into the accident. Most of the wreckage of the aircraft was raised on 4 January 2018.[12] The intermediate report, published on 31 January 2018, indicated that the aircraft was found to have followed a differing flight path from the usual, and had failed to climb to the necessary altitude needed to fly over the surrounding terrain. It also indicated that the preliminary examination of aircraft flight control surfaces and controls seemed in sound order and expected positions, and that the engine sounded normal to witnesses on the ground. The aircraft landed inverted and all six on board suffered fatal injuries.[5]
On 28 January 2021, the ATSB released a final report into the accident, which concluded that the pilot and passengers had higher than normal levels of carboxyhaemoglobin in their blood. Additionally, several pre-existing cracks in the exhaust collector ring very likely released exhaust gas into the engine/accessory bay' gas very likely entered the cabin through holes in the main firewall where three bolts were missing from the magneto access panels. The aircraft was fitted with a disposable CO detector, but CO detectors of its kind have been widely deemed unreliable.[5]
The operators of the aircraft have implemented changes to the aircraft's system of maintenance, which include:

The aircraft being fitted with active electronic CO detectors.
The check of the serviceability of the CO detectors has been incorporated into the monthly emergency equipment checklist.
Directing its new maintenance provider that the removal and installation of the main firewall access panels must be classified as a critical maintenance operation task, and will require certification by a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer and a conformity inspection.
Directing its new maintenance provider that following maintenance activities on the engine exhaust system or use of the main firewall access panels, the test for the presence of CO must be conducted.
An inspection of the magneto access panels and CO testing has been incorporated into the 100-hourly 'B' check inspection.[5]
In popular culture[edit]
The crash was featured in season 23, episode 7 of the Canadian documentary series Mayday, titled "Dream Flight Disaster".[13]

The Packard Executive was an automobile produced by the Packard-Clipper Division of the Studebaker-Packard Corporation in 1956.


Introduction[edit]
The Packard Executive was introduced on March 5, 1956 to fill a perceived price gap between the prestige Packard Patrician line and the new Clipper marque, which was in its first year as a separate marque.  In previous years, Clipper models had been Packards.  The most expensive Clipper, the Clipper Custom, listed at $3,065 for the 4-door sedan. The Packard Executive sedan retailed for $3,465, the Executive 2-door coupe $3,560,[1] while the top-of-the-line Patrician sedan sold for $4,160.
The Executive was marketed with the invitation to “enter the luxury car class now—at a modest investment,” and was aimed at "the young man on the way up."

Description[edit]
The Executive was created by combining the Clipper Custom's body, complete with its distinctive tail light design, and installing the front fenders, hood, and radiator grille assembly of the senior Packard models. It also used the Clipper Custom's 122-inch (3,100 mm) wheelbase and its 352 cu in (5.8 L) 275 hp (205 kW) all new, Packard designed  overhead valve V8 engine. This contrasted with the engine used by the top level 1956 Packard Patrician, which displaced 374 cu in (6.1 L) and developed 295 hp (220 kW) (310 hp (230 kW) for the Caribbean).
Beyond the senior Packard grille and front end sheet metal, Executives were further distinguished from the Clipper line by a unique side trim design that made reference to the senior Packards, and allowed for two-toned paint schemes. However, the interior appointments and instrumentation were pure Clipper. The prototypes produced for the all-new 1957 Packard and Clipper lines show an all-new Executive that would become a baseline Packard. All 1957 Clippers would have an all-new body which shared many inner panels with the all-new large Studebaker. Body panel sharing was the new plan for Studebaker-Packard models. Unfortunately the Insurance Companies would not finance the ambitious plan, and SPC was forced to retrench and ended up sharing body panels with the midsize Studebaker models. There was a 1957 Clipper, the last year to carry that name. Originally, the plan was to call the 1957 model an Executive. It was hoped to be a bridge car until an all-new big Packard could be introduced. See Facel-Vega for a 1959 proposal for a rebadged Packard.
Executives received their own series designation of 5670. It was offered in two body styles; a two-door hardtop (model 5677), and a four-door Touring Sedan (model 5672).

Sales[edit]
Although the Executive sold as fast as it was produced[citation needed] it was not enough to substantially improve the financial picture for the Packard-Clipper Division. Even as the Executive was being announced, the media had already been reporting of sales and fiscal woes at the Studebaker-Packard Corporation, and rumors were flying the Packard marque might be discontinued.  These rumors weighed heavily on the company’s efforts to sell any of its products. Buyers did not wish to be stuck with a so-called “orphan” car, where spare parts would no longer be available from a dealer, and resale values would be negatively impacted.
During the Executive's shortened model year of March through June, Packard built a total of 2,779[2] Executives—1,031 two-door hardtops and 1,748 four-door sedans.[2]
All Detroit production of Packard and Clipper models ceased 25 June 1956 with the shuttering of the Conner Avenue assembly plant. The Packard name was continued for the 1957 and 1958 model years on products based on Studebaker platforms, built on the same assembly lines in South Bend, Indiana as the Studebaker models.

State Road 35 (SR 35) is a north–south state highway in the western counties of the U.S. state of Florida.


Route description[edit]
It is mainly signed as a hidden route along U.S. Highways:

U.S. Route 17: Punta Gorda to Bartow.
U.S. Route 98: Zolfo Springs to Trilacoochee (which also carries hidden SR 700).
U.S. Route 301: south of Dade City to Belleview
In Bartow, SR 35 turns west and follows East Main Street, before turning north again on North Broadway Avenue, and rejoining US 98 again at SR 60 (Van Fleet Drive).
Evidence of SR 35's existence can be found in Hardee County, Florida along County Roads 35A & 35B in Coker, Wauchula, and Zolfo Springs. Polk County's evidence of SR 35's existence can be found with County Road 35A between Lakeland and Providence, and in Pasco County, Florida, evidence of SR 35's existence can be found with County Road 35 Alternate between Branchborough and Dade City. According to some maps, County Road 41 Alternate (Spring Valley Road) was previously known as CR 35B, and was extended to US 98-301 north of Dade City along Frazee Hill Road.

SR 35 becomes CR 35 in Silver Springs, Florida.
Within Belleview, the road is briefly co-signed with US 27-441 (SR 25-500) then turns right at the eastern terminus of CR 484, where it is signed independently along Southeast Hames Road, and then turns left again at Baseline Road, where it curves north as it leaves the city. While State Road 35 terminates at State Road 40 near the site of the former Wild Waters water park in Silver Springs, the road continues northward as County Road 35 through the intersection with State Road 326, passing through Indian Lake State Forest where it finally terminates at Northeast 90th Street Road and Northeast 97th Street Road.

Arlind Basha (born 8 February 1996, in Geneva) is a Kosovar-Albanian football player who was born in Switzerland. He most recently played for FC Haka in the Finnish Ykkönen.


Club career[edit]
KF Vëllaznimi[edit]
Arlind Basha started his career in KF Vëllaznimi at the age of 7. When he was 13 years old he went on a trial in Chievo but couldn't sign for them because he was to young. In April 2012 he made his senior debut for Vëllaznimi and scored his first goal on that debut match thus becoming the youngest ever goalscorer in the Football Superleague of Kosovo with 16 years of age.

Hajduk Split[edit]
In May 2012 Basha joined Hajduk Split on a trial and after some time the Hajduk board decided to sign him. Because of some bureaucratic problems Basha wasn't able to join the Hajduk senior squad until he was 18 years old. The first time he played for the Hajduk Split senior squad was in a friendly match against Beşiktaş J.K. on 10 November 2013. He came in as a late substitute in the 80th minute. During the   clubs winter preparations he was chosen by Hajduk manager Igor Tudor to join the squad for the following  2013–14 Prva HNL.
He made his debut in the Prva HNL on 14 February 2014 against NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac. He came in as a substitute in the 45th minute.[1]
He was released from Hajduk Split in 2016.

Personal life[edit]
He was born in Geneva but at the age of 6 he and his family returned to Kosovo. He doesn't have Swiss papers so he is ineligible to play for the Switzerland national football team.
He expressed his great desire to play for the Albania or Kosovo national team.

Biography[edit]
Miļkevičs ran a career-best 46.44 in the 400 metres at the 2003 European Athletics U23 Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland. He has won an NCAA championship while competing for the University of Nebraska. In the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was 14th in the 800 metres. In 2006, he set the Latvian record in the 800 metres with a time of 1:43.67, a record which still stands.
After Miļkevičs found out that, due to lack of funds, the Latvian Athletics Union wouldn't able to pay for Latvian delegation's start at the 2010 European Athletics Championships, he decided not to compete.

HD 97048 or CU Chamaeleontis is a Herbig Ae/Be star 603 ly away in the constellation Chamaeleon.  It is a variable star embedded in a dust cloud containing a stellar nursery, and is itself surrounded by a dust disk.
HD 97048 is a young star still contracting towards the main sequence.  Its brightness varies between magnitudes 8.38 and 8.48 and it is classified as an Orion variable.[2]  It was given the variable star designation CU Chamaeleontis in 1981.[9]  Its spectrum is also variable.  The spectral class is usually given as A0 or B9, sometimes with a giant luminosity class, sometimes main sequence. The spectrum shows strong variable emission lines indicative of a shell surrounding the star.[10]
HD 97048 is a member of the Chamaeleon T1 stellar association and is still embedded within the dark molecular cloud that it is forming from. It illuminates a small reflection nebula against the dark cloud.[11]

Planetary system[edit]
This star has a substantial dust disk having a central cavity with a 40−46 AU radius[3] The disk has a carbon monoxide gas velocity kink and intensity gap at 130 AUs, which is suspected to be caused by a superjovian planet.[12] In 2019, HCO+ ion and Hydrogen cyanide emission was detected from the disk, suggesting a large amount of gas is orbiting beyond 200 AU radius.[13]

Velocity kink for the CO gas and gap in the disk, showing the presence of a protoplanet
In the system a kink in the velocity of carbon monoxide gas (CO 3-2) as well as a gap in the dust emission of the disk are seen as evidence for a jovian protoplanet. The protoplanet is located at 130 au from the star and has a mass of about 2.5 Jupiter masses. It is one of the lowest mass protoplanets discovered as of 2023.[14]

Challenge!(1969)

Anywhere(1970)

Satori(1971)

Anywhere is a 1970 album by Japanese rock band Flower Travellin' Band.[1] It was their first release under the Flower Travellin' Band name and the first to feature the classic line-up of Joe Yamanaka, Hideki Ishima, Jun Kozuki and Joji Wada.


Overview[edit]
Following the release of Challenge!, Yuya Uchida dropped all the members of Yuya Uchida & The Flowers, except drummer Joji Wada, recruited guitarist Hideki Ishima, vocalist Joe Yamanaka and bassist Jun Kozuki, and formed the Flower Travellin' Band as a band that would appeal to international audiences.
Anywhere was made to emulate the band's previous release Challenge! by mainly consisting of cover songs and nude cover art, before releasing their first original album, Satori, shortly after. The cover was taken early in the morning at a former garbage dump in the seaside area that would later become Odaiba.[2] It was used as the cover for Julian Cope's 2007 book Japrocksampler.[3]

Reception[edit]
Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllmusic[4]
Musician and author Julian Cope included Anywhere at number 28 on his list of the top 50 albums of Japanese rock, as found in his 2007 non-fiction book Japrocksampler. He wrote that those who dismiss it as a covers album have never heard it, "For its grooves contain such monstrous modifications that each track leaves the starting block a full metre lower than the hoary jalopy originals." Cope explained that the band dissolve the 4/4 rhythm of "Black Sabbath" into an "ambient metal assault", while their version of "House of the Rising Sun" delivers "the proto-'Stairway to Heaven' shock-of-a-lifetime."[5] Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic rated the album 3 out of 5 stars, describing the music as a "unique mixture of progressive daring, psychedelic eccentricity, and muscular, heavy rock austerity".[4]

Bryan Andrew Wilson (born November 3, 1983) is an American gospel musician. He calls his music "spiritual soul" because it combines the passion of faith with the sound of R&B. Wilson began his career as a child gospel star, belting out "His Eye is on the Sparrow" with the Mississippi Children's Choir in the 1990s. After nearly a decade away from the music business, Wilson resurfaced in 2008 with an adult R&B-flavored style of urban inspirational gospel music that has proven successful with his recent Billboard Magazine chart hits, "Turning Away" (2014) and "Overflow" (2016). Billboard magazine Gospel Albums chart.

Early life[edit]
Wilson was born Bryan Andrew Wilson in Danville, Illinois, on November 3, 1983, to Sheila Davis Wilson and Beau Briggs.[1] Wilson came into prominence when he led the song "His Eye is on the Sparrow" with the Mississippi Children's Choir when he was young. The song was featured on the live recording "A New Creation," which sold 100,000 units in 1995. The YouTube videos of Wilson performing the song have amassed more than three million views, and the success led to a recording deal with Malaco Records. His debut album, "Bryan's Songs," was produced by gospel legends such as Kirk Franklin, John P. Kee, and Walter Hawkins. The album earned Wilson the Dove Award and Stellar Gospel Music Award nominations. He performed his radio single, "Blessed Assurance," to a standing ovation on the Stellar Awards in 1997. After his voice changed, Wilson temporarily lost his upper vocal range. "I remember going places and they would want me to sing in certain keys, and a couple of times some audiences, even though I was a teenager, they booed me."[2]  Frustrated, Wilson figured his singing days were behind him, so he left music and enrolled in college. He graduated from Claflin University during their May 2004 commencement ceremony with a bachelor's degree in Religion and Philosophy.[1][3] Subsequently, he went onto Princeton Theological Seminary, where he studied for a year.[1][3] By 2008, Wilson had returned to music with his third solo album, "A Second Coming." It received a rave review from Billboard Magazine's gospel editor, Gordon Ely, but the Dallas Morning News' reporter, Selwyn Crawford, was less enthusiastic. "It's a nice effort, but much of the CD sounds like what it is—a former star trying to reinvent himself. Too bad that Bryan Wilson's `second coming' is not the one we're looking for."[4]

Music career[edit]
After seven years of trying to find a new musical footing, Wilson finally hit pay dirt in 2014 with the release of the haunting ballad, "Turning Away." It reached No. 15 on Billboard Magazine's Gospel Airplay chart and No. 21 on its Hot Gospel Songs chart. "My message is gospel, but I'm singing from my soul, my experience," he told The Clarion Ledger's Jacob Threadgill in an interview. "If you hear a crack in my voice, it is because of the pain that I had to go through." It anchored his fifth album, "The One Percent." The project featured a variety of musical styles.  He gave Ben E. King's 1961 classic, "Stand by Me," a Caribbean dance flavor, and he injected Jesus Culture's epic tune, "Show Me Your Glory" with a shot of gospel energy and fused it with a festive rendition of Will Reagan's "Set A Fire." An ASCAP editor wrote of the album that, "Wilson blends a mix of modern soul, funk and gospel styles in songs full of infectious arrangements and personal lyrics. This passionate and vibrant recording is a testament to gospel music's enduring power and growth."[5] Wilson continued his musical comeback with "Overflow (Let Your Spirit)," which features the group Roderick Giles & Grace on background vocals. It reached No. 12 on Billboard Magazine's Gospel Airplay chart, No. 20 on its Hot Gospel Songs chart and No. 1 on its Gospel Recurrent chart in the summer of 2016. The upbeat track earned Wilson his first Stellar Gospel Music Award nominations since his teenage years. It was nominated in the categories of Traditional Male Vocalist of the Year and Best Duo/Group of the Year.[6]
Wilson's latest radio single, "Whoa!," is an inspirational, feel-good track. In the Journal of Gospel Music, editor Bob Marovich writes that, "Wilson opens 2017 with a well-crafted single whose message of encouragement is a life saver in the midst of a swirling rapid...`Whoa!' is a fine follow up to `Overflow' and much closer  to `Turning Away' in appeal. Check out Bryan's crystalline high notes at the end."[7]

George England (fl. 1735), was an English divine and author. 
England was a member of the England family which flourished at Yarmouth, Norfolk, in the 16th and 17th centuries, and may have been a grandson of Sir George England.

Career[edit]
He was chaplain to Lord Hobart, by whom he was presented in 1733 to the living of Hanworth, Norfolk. In 1737 he resigned Hanworth to become rector of Wolterton and Wickmere, a consolidated living in the same county.

Writings[edit]
He was the author of ‘An Enquiry into the Morals of the Ancients,’ London, 1737, 4to, a work based on the belief that the ‘ancients,’ by whom is understood the Greeks and Romans, were much superior in the practice of morality to Christians in general.

Joseph Buell Ely (February 22, 1881 – June 13, 1956) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Massachusetts.  As a conservative Democrat, Ely was active in party politics from the late 1910s, helping to build, in conjunction with David I. Walsh, the Democratic coalition that would gain an enduring political ascendancy in the state.  From 1931 to 1935, he served as the 52nd Governor.  He was opposed to the federal expansion of the New Deal, and was a prominent intra-party voice in opposition to the policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  In 1944 he made a brief unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.


Early years[edit]
Joseph Buell Ely was born in Westfield, Massachusetts, to Henry Wilson Ely and Sarah Naomi Buell Ely.  His grandfather, Joseph Miner Ely, was one of the founders of Westfield's important whip industry, and his father, a lawyer, was active in Democratic party circles in heavily Republican western Massachusetts.  Ely attended local schools, and then Williams College, where he helped organize student support for William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 presidential election.  He graduated from Williams in 1902, and then received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1905. He returned to Westfield, where he joined his father's law firm.  In 1906 he married Harriet Zelda Dyson, a schoolteacher; they had one son.[1]
Governor David I. Walsh appointed Ely to serve as District Attorney for the Western District of Massachusetts in 1915; he was elected in his own right to this position the next year, serving until 1920.[1]

Political career[edit]
Ely in the 1920's.
See also: 1931–1932 Massachusetts legislature and 1933–1934 Massachusetts legislature
Ely was active in the state Democratic Party, and was in 1922 put forward as a candidate for Governor of Massachusetts; he placed a distant third in the primary, which was won by John "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald.  In 1924 he was delegate to the national Democratic convention, where he supported the Progressive Al Smith.[1] In 1926 he was tapped by the party leadership as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but lost the primary in an unusual quirk.  His primary opponent, Harry Dooley, had been asked to withdraw so that the party could present an ethnically diverse and geographically balanced ticket, but his name remained on the ballot, and he ended up winning the nomination because of the support of Irish Americans.  Dooley offered to surrender the nomination in favor of Ely, but the latter refused, believing the means to be an embarrassment.[2] Ely again supported Smith at the 1928 Democratic National Convention.[1]
In 1930, Ely again stood for the Democratic nomination for governor.  He was opposed in this by the aging Honey Fitz, who was little more than a proxy candidate for former Boston mayor James Michael Curley. Curley loudly accused the Yankee Protestant Ely of being anti-Irish, which Ely countered by pointing out Curley's own public criticisms of Irish-American politicians in his campaigns.  Al Smith campaigned for Ely, who won the nomination by a narrow margin.[3]
Ely was opposed in the general election by incumbent Governor Frank G. Allen.  The Republicans were harmed politically by the 1929 Stock Market Crash and the start of the Great Depression, and were further divided over the issue of Prohibition.  Ely ran on a platform emphasizing debt-financed public works projects.[1]
After Ely took office, he began a series of public works projects to relieve unemployment.  These were funded by long-term debts and were approved by the Republican-controlled legislature.  Unlike other states, Massachusetts refused federal aid during Ely's administration.[4]  Highway construction in Massachusetts was accelerated by this work, which was also supported by the imposition of a gasoline tax.
Other policies advocated by Ely included substantial reductions in state salaries during the depression, which was met with overwhelming legislative resistance. In concert with the City of Boston, Ely established a permanent Boston Police Academy to increase the training of public safety officers.
Curley and Ely would again cross swords in the 1932 presidential election, when Curley supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Ely supported Smith.[5]  Ely and Walsh were successful in getting Curley and other Roosevelt supporters excluded from the state's delegation to the 1932 Democratic National Convention, although Curley attended the convention anyway as a delegate representing Puerto Rico.[6] Ely gave the convention speech formally nominating Smith,[7] but shifted to giving lukewarm support to Roosevelt after the latter won the party's nomination.[8] He was afterward snubbed by Roosevelt on federal appointment matters because of his support for Smith.  Ely comfortably won reelection in 1932, defeating Lieutenant Governor William S. Youngman.[4]  Since the debt-funded works projects were not having a significant impact economically, Ely abandoned the idea in his second term, returning to "pay-as-you-go" financing for such projects.[9]  The divisive and at times acrimonious intra-party strife between Curley and the Ely-Walsh wing of the Democratic Party contributed to the state's difficulties in securing federal relief funds.[10]

Later years[edit]
Ely declined to run for reelection in 1934 and returned to law. He became a senior partner in the firm of Ely, Bradford, Thompson and Brown with future governor Robert F. Bradford and George E. Thompson.[11] He remained active in state and national Democratic politics, continuing to oppose Roosevelt's New Deal policies,[9] which he considered "dangerously socialistic".[12]  As legal representative to Boston real estate interests, he opposed the city's acquisition of land for New Deal projects,[13] tieing up the Old Harbor Housing Project in litigation for over two years.[14]  In 1935, he joined the American Liberty League, and supported Republican Alf Landon in the 1936 presidential election.[9] He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1944, ending the bid after being badly defeated in the Massachusetts primary.[15]
Joseph Ely is well remembered in his hometown, where Westfield State University's Governor Joseph B. Ely Library is named in his honor.

Roberto "Robbie" Herrera (born 12 June 1970) is an English former professional footballer, who is currently head of the youth team at Torquay United.


Playing career[edit]
Herrera, born and raised in Torquay, South Devon, and registered as a schoolboy with his local side Torquay United, began his career as an apprentice with Queens Park Rangers, turning professional on 1 March 1988. His league debut came as a substitute on 14 January 1989 in an away defeat against Wimbledon, but future appearances proved to be hard to come by.
Herrera returned to Torquay United on loan on 17 March 1992, playing 11 league games. A further loan spell at Plainmoor followed on 24 October 1992, Herrera returning to the QPR reserves after five games. On 29 October 1993, he made the short move from Loftus Road to Fulham, where he eventually made 144 league appearances, scoring twice. After helping Fulham to promotion from Division 3 in 1997, Herrera lost his place to former QPR colleague Rufus Brevett, as the ambitions of their owner Mohamed Al Fayed became apparent, ambitions that would see the London side in the Premiership within four years.
The situation surrounding Herrera's move to Fulham was a unique one. During a time of financial frailty for Fulham, chairman Jimmy Hill came out in front of the crowd and said that they had identified a full back from Queens Park Rangers who he and the manager thought would improve the team. Hill asked that Fulham fans contribute what they can towards the £60,000 for the signing of this full back and the following game Herrera was paraded in front of the crowd with the rumour being that film star Hugh Grant had stumped up the transfer fee. It was later revealed that director Cyril Swain had actually funded the transfer.[1]
On 4 August 1998, he signed for Torquay for a fee of £30,000, his solid defending and quick attacking instincts helping to establish him in the team. However, a recurring groin injury caused him to miss games, and during the 2000–01 season he found it difficult to sustain himself as a first team regular, not playing at all after 31 March. Although his form was not good, he was played as a wing-back by Wes Saunders, and not in his natural full-back position. It was little surprise that Herrera was one of the three players released at the end of the 2000–01 season. He had played 104 league games, scoring one goal against Rochdale,[2] in his third spell at the club.
Surprisingly, given his poor showing the previous season, Herrera was invited back to Plainmoor on trial by new manager Roy McFarland, playing in the 2–0 win away to Newton Abbot on 25 July 2001. On 8 August he signed a three-month contract,[3] and played in the opening game of the season away to Bristol Rovers. Two further appearances followed, but he then slipped out of the reckoning and was released on 17 September.
He joined Leyton Orient on trial on 1 October, signing a one-month contract two days later as manager Tommy Taylor wanted cover for the injured Matthew Lockwood.[4] Taylor was sacked soon after, but Herrera impressed new manager Paul Brush enough to earn a second month's contract beginning on 5 November, despite being out with first a back injury and then a toe injury. He was released by Orient later that month and joined non-league Grays Athletic.
In December 2005, Herrera joined Leroy Rosenior's Merthyr Tydfil,[5] moving on to Taunton Town, managed by former Torquay player Russell Musker in August 2002.[6] He left Taunton in the summer of 2003 to join Bideford, managed by another former Torquay player Sean William Joyce.
In March 2006 he joined another North Devon side Torrington, taking over as player-manager the following month.[7] Herrera resigned in February 2007 after a 7–0 defeat against Melksham Town,[8] and returned to Bideford as a player only.

Coaching career[edit]
After ending his playing career, Herrera worked with Torquay United's youth team, and held coaching positions as well as being the club's College Co-Ordinator. In September 2009, following United winger Saul Halpin's graduation to the first team, then-chief executive Colin Lee hailed Herrera's contribution to the college scheme, saying "Robbie has done a fantastic job, and he's been a big reason for the course's success on the football side."[9] As part of his involvement with Torquay's youth team, Herrera occasionally refereed matches between their U-18s and the youth sides of other clubs.[10] Herrera was relieved of his youth team duties with Torquay United in the summer of 2014, as part of the club closing their youth academy.[11]
When Kevin Nicholson announced as player-manager of Torquay United in early October 2015, Robbie rejoined the club as Nicholson's assistant manager. Kevin Nicholson described Herrera to BBC Sport as someone "I trust and someone who I know will do everything in his power to be a success with the attitude and personality that I want about the place."[12] In August 2017 Nicholson was sacked by Torquay, and Herrera was appointed as caretaker manager. He took charge of six of the Gulls' games, drawing two and losing four. Shortly after the appointment of Gary Owers as full-time manager, Herrera left Torquay.[13][14]
In March 2018 Herrera was appointed as professional development coach at Plymouth Argyle, dealing with players aged 17 to 21. This job was vacant after Shaun Taylor had left the role to join Herrera's old club Torquay United's re-opened Youth Academy as head of academy coaching.[15] In 2020, Herrera was appointed both first team coach and head of development at Southern League South side Dorchester Town.

Cornelis Vreeswijk (Swedish pronunciationⓘ; Dutch pronunciationⓘ; 8 August 1937 – 12 November 1987) was a Dutch-born Swedish singer-songwriter and poet.
He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He was educated as a social worker and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement. Vreeswijk is considered one of the most influential and successful troubadours in Sweden. In 2010, the Swedish drama film Cornelis was made about his life, directed by Amir Chamdin.[1]


Early life[edit]
Cornelis Vreeswijk was born and grew up in the Netherlands. He emigrated to Sweden with his parents in 1949 at the age of twelve. He left school in 1955 and went to sea, where he passed the time playing the blues. He returned to Sweden in 1959.[2] He was educated as a social worker at Stockholm University[3] and hoped to become a journalist, but became increasingly involved in music, performing at events for students with idiosyncratic humor and social engagement.

Swedish career[edit]
Vreeswijk explained in one of his few interviews that he had taught himself to sing and play in the fifties by imitating his first idols Josh White and Lead Belly. His first album, Ballader och oförskämdheter (Ballads and rudenesses, 1964), was a hit which immediately gained him a large following among the emerging radical student generation. In this period he also played with Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and his trio. His songs "Ångbåtsblues" ("Steam Boat Blues") and "Jubelvisa för Fiffiga Nanette" ("Joyful song for Clever Nanette") are classics from these recordings. His abrasive, frequently political lyrics and unconventional delivery were a deliberate break with what he was later to describe as a Swedish song tradition of pretty singing and harmless lyrics, "a hobby for the upper classes". Influenced by jazz and blues and especially by the singing style and social criticism of Georges Brassens, Vreeswijk "speak-sings" his "insults", and compels his listeners to pay close attention to the words.

His 1965 loose translation of Allan Sherman's masterpiece "Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh" remains beloved to Swedes as "Brev från kolonien" (Letter from the summer camp) decades later, and could be said to have passed into folklore.
A political singer with a bohemian lifestyle, Vreeswijk remained controversial in the sixties and early seventies, idolized by his fans but disapproved of by many others for his "rude" language and persistent interest in "unsuitable" people like prostitutes and criminals. Some of his records were blacklisted by the public broadcasting company Sveriges Radio. During this period, he not only wrote and recorded songs now considered classics, such as "Sportiga Marie" ("Sporty Marie") and several affectionate salutes to the ever less employable "Polaren Pär" ("My Buddy Pär"), but he was an actor on the stage, receiving considerable critical acclaim, most notably as Pilate in the Swedish version of Jesus Christ Superstar, and as Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof. He participated in Melodifestivalen (the Swedish preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest) in 1972 with "Önskar du mig, så önskar jag dig", which finished sixth. He also appeared in movies, including Svarta Palmkronor (Black Palm Trees, 1968), which was filmed on location in Brazil. Spending four months in Brazil began Vreeswijk's lifelong interest in Latin American music and social and political conditions, later seen for example in his Victor Jara album of 1978.

Portrait of Cornelis Vreeswijk by the Swedish painter Tommy Tallstig
Later in his career, Vreeswijk was to gain increasing fame and a wider audience both for his songs and his other work. He published several volumes of poetry in his lifetime and left a considerable manuscript legacy of poems which have been published since. He also became an important musical interpreter of the works of other people, recording the songs of Carl Michael Bellman, Evert Taube, and Lars Forssell. His fresh, bluesy renderings of Bellman and Taube, who had up to then been classics belonging to the "harmless" tradition that Vreeswijk despised, were artistic and commercial successes which extended his fanbase. The choice of Bellman was significant: Bellman's lively, romantic, pastoral, drinking and sometimes bawdy songs gained Vreeswijk the reputation of being a drunken womaniser, with the association of being "something of a Bellman himself". Like his friend Fred Åkerström, he gave Bellman's songs, "a new and more powerful expression" than they had had before, and like him identifying himself with Bellman's fictional character Fredman, expressing his drunkenness, poverty, and despair, with an intensity that increased in his performances over the years. Bellman's songs featured in many of his performances; two of his albums were dedicated to Bellman's songs, namely the 1971 Spring mot Ulla, spring! Cornelis sjunger Bellman containing 13 of Fredman's Epistles, and the 1977 Movitz! Movitz!, containing 12: the popular Epistle 81, Märk hur vår skugga, appears on both albums.[4]
Vreeswijk's own best-known songs of the later seventies and early eighties tend to be dark in tone, like "Sist jag åkte jumbojet blues" ("Last time I Went by Jumbojet Blues", a metaphorical bad trip) and "Blues för Fatumeh", both addressing heavy drug addiction. Even though in this period Vreeswijk was a prey of tabloid scandal and in the news for his drinking problem and his debts (about both of which he spoke with frankness) rather than for his achievements, he remained highly productive. He is also known as the co-writer of the Hep Stars song "Speleman" which was released for their album Songs We Sang 68.

Vreeswijk's tombstone at Katarina kyrka
Towards the end of his life his reputation soared again, aided by the televising of some highly regarded nightclub shows, and by Agneta Brunius' TV documentary Balladen om den flygande holländaren (The Ballad of the Flying Dutchman) in 1986. By the time of his death from liver cancer at the age of fifty, Vreeswijk had become an icon of the Swedish music scene, and he was honored with burial at the cemetery of Katarina kyrka, a national cemetery in Stockholm. It was broadcast live on Swedish television. In 2010, Cornelis, a movie about his life, premiered in Swedish cinemas. Norwegian singer Hans Erik Dyvik Husby (previously in Turbonegro) played the role of Vreeswijk.

Dutch career[edit]
Cornelis Vreeswijk (1967)
In 1966, the Dutch broadcasting organisation VARA invited Vreeswijk to the Netherlands. He translated several of his songs into Dutch, and wrote a couple of new ones. One of his songs, "De nozem en de non" ("The Greaser and the Nun"), was released as a single, without much popular success. His first Dutch album was only released in 1972, after ten successful Swedish albums. 100,000 copies of Cornelis Vreeswijk were sold, and the single "Veronica" became a big hit after it was picked up by the pirate radio station Veronica. His old song "De nozem en de non" was then re-recorded and released with much success. His later albums could not match the success of the first one, and Vreeswijk never achieved the fame in the Netherlands that he did in Sweden.
Nowadays, only "De nozem en de non" is still known by the general Dutch public. Vreeswijk still has some fans in the Netherlands, however, and in 2000 the Cornelis Vreeswijk society was founded.
One reason for his lack of popularity in the Netherlands was the impression that he was a bit old-fashioned. Because of his long stay in Sweden, though he never became a citizen,[5] the Dutch pronunciation and idiom that he had learned to speak in his youth were out-of-date in the seventies and eighties.
Although he was fluent in both Dutch and Swedish, the latter became his primary language. His Stockholm-accented Swedish was famously witty and expressive.

Later life[edit]
He gave his last concert in Uppsala in September 1987, suffering from liver cancer and diabetes. He recorded his last album and a book of poetry, both entitled Till Fatumeh. He travelled one last time to the Netherlands to see his family, returned to Stockholm and died soon afterwards.[2]

Robert Moore (born March 31, 2002) is an American professional baseball second baseman in the Philadelphia Phillies organization.


Amateur career[edit]
Moore attended Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village, Kansas.[1] He played for USA Baseball twice as an amateur.[2] As a sophomore at Shawnee Mission East, he batted .392.[3] In July 2019, he participated in the Under Armour All-America Baseball Game at Wrigley Field.[4] He graduated from high school early in December 2019 so he could enroll at the University of Arkansas to play college baseball.[5]
As a freshman at Arkansas in 2020, Moore started all 16 of Arkansas' games in which he batted .317 with two home runs and 17 RBIs before the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6][7] That summer, he played in the Northwoods League for the Rochester Honkers.[8] He earned postseason All-Star honors after batting .303 with twenty stolen bases and 22 walks over 119 at-bats.[9] In 2021, Moore returned as the starting second baseman for the Razorbacks.[10][8] On March 30, he became the first Razorback since 1994 to hit for the cycle in a 21-8 win over Central Arkansas University.[3] Over 61 games for the season, he slashed .283/.408/.558 with 16 home runs and 53 RBIs.[11] His 16 home runs were most on the team.[12] He was named to the USA Baseball National Collegiate Team that summer.[13] Moore entered the 2022 season as a top prospect for the upcoming draft.[14] His draft stock fell after he ended the season batting .233 with eight home runs and 44 RBIs over 63 games.[15] He was awarded an ABCA/Rawlings Gold Glove.[16]

Professional career[edit]
The Milwaukee Brewers selected Moore with the 72nd overall pick of the 2022 Major League Baseball draft.[17] He signed with the team for $800,000.[18]
Moore made his professional debut with the Arizona Complex League Brewers and was promoted to the Carolina Mudcats after four games.[19] Over 31 games, he batted .248 with three home runs, 16 RBIs, and seven stolen bases.[20] He spent the 2023 season with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[21] Over 123 games, he hit .233 with eight home runs, 62 RBIs, 33 doubles, and 26 stolen bases.[22]
Moore was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on November 14, 2023 (along with Hendry Mendez) in exchange for Oliver Dunn.[23]

NamesWolfgang MoritzHouseHesse-KasselFatherPrince Frederick Charles of HesseMotherPrincess Margaret of Prussia
Prince Wolfgang of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (Wolfgang Moritz; 6 November 1896 – 12 July 1989) was the designated Hereditary Prince of the monarchy of Finland (with the irredentist pretension to Estonia[citation needed]), and as such, already called the Crown Prince of Finland officially until 14 December 1918, and also afterwards by some monarchists.
Wolfgang was born at Castle Rumpenheim, Offenbach am Main. He was the second-born of a pair of twins, the fourth child and son born to Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse (1868–1940) and Princess Margaret of Prussia (1872–1954). His maternal uncle was the German Emperor William II. Wolfgang's father Frederick Charles of Hesse was elected King of Finland on 9 October 1918, to replace his first cousin once removed, the deposed Russian emperor, Nicholas II, who was titled Grand Duke of Finland. However, Frederick Charles renounced the throne on 14 December 1918, and the title was never actually held by the family.
Wolfgang would have been his father's heir as King of Finland instead of his elder twin Prince Philipp of Hesse (1896–1980), who was the next heir of the rights over the defunct Electorate of Hesse, but apparently because Wolfgang was with his parents in 1918 and ready to travel to Finland (where a wedding to a Finnish lady was reportedly being prepared for the coming Crown Prince). Philipp was on active service and incommunicado at the time.
Wolfgang married on 17 September 1924 Princess Marie Alexandra of Baden (1902–1944), daughter of Prince Maximilian of Baden and Princess Marie Louise of Hanover; they had no children. 
Wolfgang adopted his nephew, Prince Karl Adolf of Hesse (born 1937), elder son of his younger brother Christoph who was killed in action in 1943.
At the time of his death in Frankfurt at the age of 92, Wolfgang was the last surviving descendant of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom who had been born in her lifetime. Victoria died in 1901 when Wolfgang was four years old.
He married secondly Ottilie Moeller (1903-1991), the daughter of Ludwig Moeller and Eleanore Steinmann, in September 1948.

Richard Thomas Swatland (October 8, 1945 – April 9, 2022) was an American football guard who played one season in the American Football League (AFL) for the Houston Oilers. He played college football at Notre Dame and was selected in the 8th round (195th overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints. Swatland also spent time with the Bridgeport Jets of the Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL), the Washington Redskins and New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL), and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL).


Early life and education[edit]
Swatland was born on October 8, 1945, in Stamford, Connecticut.[1] He attended Stamford Catholic High School, where he was named all-state and All-American as a senior in 1963.[2]
Swatland played college football at Notre Dame. As a freshman, he missed the entire football season.[3] In his second year, Swatland became the team's starting right guard, though he could also play at left guard.[4] In 1966, he was a starter on Notre Dame's undefeated national championship team.[5] As a senior in 1967, Swatland was named second-team All-American by the Central Press Association.[6]

Professional career[edit]
Swatland was selected in the 8th round (195th overall) of the 1968 NFL/AFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints.[7] He signed a contract with the Saints in early June.[8] He was released by the Saints in mid-August, but was recommended to play with their farm team, the Richmond Roadrunners.[9]
Rather than play for the Roadrunners, Swatland signed a practice squad contract with the Houston Oilers along with Jim LeMoine.[10] He was later promoted to the active roster to be the backup to Tom Regner, one of his teammates at Notre Dame.[11] Overall, Swatland appeared in four games in the 1968 season, starting none.[12] He wore number 64 with the Oilers.[12]
Despite being "almost assured of a job" after Sonny Bishop retired, Swatland was released as part of the final roster cuts in 1969.[13] On October 6, it was announced that he had joined the Bridgeport Jets of the Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL).[2]
In 1970, Swatland was signed by the Washington Redskins, but did not make their final roster.[14]
In 1971, Swatland signed with the New England Patriots, but was placed on the injury waiver list and was released in August.[15]
After being released by the Patriots, Swatland signed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but quit midseason.[16][5] "On my way home I stopped at Niagara Falls and threw my spikes over the falls. I had enough," he later said.[5]

Later life and death[edit]
Swatland later became a real estate lawyer.[5] He died on April 9, 2022, at the age of 76.[17]

Description[edit]
Buildings in the complex comprise a standard roadside station, type 4, completed in 1882, with a brick platform face; a signal box with a skillion roof on platform, c. 1914; a residence for a night officer, type 6, brick, and completed in 1882; and a loading bank.[2]

Heritage listing[edit]
The station complex is an intact standard roadside station with only minor detail altered. As such it is a rare surviving example. The signal box added for the yard layout is a typical simple on-platform box. The station was later provided with a second platform behind the original building, a rather unusual situation in the country, but this was removed in 1993 and the layout rebuilt.
The residence is a good example of a simple symmetrical brick residence with detached front verandah. Its position overlooking the station enhances the sites significance.[2]
Walcha Road railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.[2]
The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.
This item is assessed as historically rare. This item is assessed as archaeologically rare. This item is assessed as socially rare.[2]

He taught on air power concepts at various staff colleges and universities throughout Europe and in 2007 taught a course on "Air Power and Ethics" in Trondheim, Norway, to the Norwegian Air Force[28]

Work in the United Arab Emirates[edit]
In November 2012, Hayward became full Professor of International and Civil Security in Khalifa University's Institute for International and Civil Security and in 2013 he became Chair of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at Khalifa. He also serves there as the Director of the Institute of International and Civil Security. In 2014 he also joined the editorial board of the Islamic Studies journal, Islamic Rethink.[29] In 2016, he was named as the “Best Professor of Humanities and Social Sciences” at the Middle East Education Leadership Awards. [30][31]

Hayward and Islam[edit]
Hayward (centre) at the "Tackling Extremism Promoting Peace and Integration" Conference, Northampton, 24 July 2011.
Hayward converted to Islam in 2005 and has lectured at anti-extremism workshops.[32] He supports Muslims serving in the British armed forces[33] and is a member of the UK Armed Forces Muslim Association.[citation needed] Hayward describes himself as "a moderate and politically liberal revert who chose to embrace the faith of Islam because of its powerful spiritual truths, its emphasis on peace and justice, its racial and ethnic inclusiveness and its charitable spirit towards the poor and needy."[34]
He said he worked with an international Muslim human rights and welfare group called Minhaj-ul-Quran and was appointed as strategic advisor to Tahir ul-Qadri and contributed to several of the group's anti-radicalisation workshops.[35]
He is considered to be one of "the world's five hundred most influential Muslims," with his listing in the 2023 and 2024 editions of The Muslim 500 stating that "he weaves together classical Islamic knowledge and methodologies and the source-critical Western historical method to make innovative yet carefully reasoned sense of complex historical issues that are still important in today's world."[36].[37]

1991 Master's thesis[edit]
Hayward's 1991 M.A. thesis was judged the best history thesis of his year and it won him the Sir James Hight Memorial Prize for "excellence" and the honour of wearing the Philip Ross May Gown at the graduation ceremony.[38][39] The thesis was submitted in 1993 yet was unavailable for public study until 1999. When it became available, Hayward was accused of advancing arguments which gave credence to Holocaust deniers.[40][41][15] In 2000, at the request of the New Zealand Jewish Council, the University of Canterbury convened a "Working Party" which issued a report admonishing the university for inadequately supervising Hayward's work.[42] The report found that Hayward's thesis showed significant industry and no evidence of dishonesty but was "seriously flawed".[43] Subsequent to the issuance of the Working Party's report, the university apologized to the New Zealand Jewish community.[41][44] Hayward admitted inexperience and regret over his thesis.[45]  
The thesis was embargoed for an unusually long period, and he requested its removal from the university library, which was denied.[46]
Academics, politicians, and community leaders, including Act MP Rodney Hide and Roger Kerr, petitioned to clear Hayward's name and decry University of Canterbury's handling of the thesis issue.[47]
Despite what transpired, Hayward clearly upholds the sound and accepted scholarly assessment of the Holocaust. In 2010 he described it as "one of history’s vilest crimes … involving the organised murder of millions of Jews"[48] and in 2011 he similarly wrote: "The Holocaust of the Jews in the Second World War, one of history’s vilest crimes, involved the organised murder of six million Jews by Germans and others who considered themselves Christians or at least members of the Christian value system."[49] Likewise, in his 2012 book, Warfare in the Quran, he criticised "the undoubted evils of Nazism".[50] In a 2018 interview, he said: "I can’t help but conclude that humans are, by and large, rather unkind to each other and sometimes utterly hateful. … How else can we explain ordinary German soldiers and paramilitary people murdering six million Jewish civilians in history’s greatest atrocity?”[51][non-primary source needed]

Libel suit[edit]
In October 2013, Hayward prevailed in a libel case against The Mail on Sunday and The Daily Mail, which had wrongly alleged that Hayward had unfairly favoured Muslim students at the RAF College, and he was awarded a retraction, an apology, and damages described as "substantial."[52]

Writing[edit]
Hayward is the author or editor of eighteen non-fiction books, including Stopped at Stalingrad: The Luftwaffe and Hitler's Defeat in the East 1942-1943 (1998 and subsequent editions), an assessment of aerial warfare at the Battle of Stalingrad, and various books on the Prophet Muhammad and the Islamic ethics of war.[53]

Christopher Mark Brown (born 27 March 1973), commonly known as Chris Brown, is a former Cook Islands cricketer, who previously played representative cricket for Auckland at New Zealand domestic level. Born in Rarotonga, Brown played his early cricket for Auckland under-age teams, and went on to represent the New Zealand national under-19s in several matches as a right-arm fast bowler. Making his first-class debut during the 1993–94 season of the Shell Trophy, he took ten wickets in his debut match, and represented the New Zealand Cricket Academy twice later in the season.
Brown regularly played for Auckland in both the first-class and limited-overs competitions during the mid-1990s, despite the squad also including several international bowlers. However, after the 1997–98 season, he ceased playing for Auckland. Brown resumed his career in the early 2000s for the Cook Islands national cricket team, playing in regional competitions, and going on to play for a representative East Asia-Pacific team. He regularly captained the country of his birth throughout the remainder of the decade, becoming one of the only first-class players to play for the country. After retiring from playing, Brown took up umpiring, and is currently a member of New Zealand Cricket's Umpiring "A" Panel.


Playing career[edit]
Born in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands' largest and most populous island, Brown played his representative cricket in New Zealand, and represented the New Zealand national under-19 cricket team in several matches against the Australian under-19s during the 1992–93 season.[1][2] He made his first-class for Auckland in the following season's Shell Trophy.[3] A right-arm fast bowler, Brown took a ten-wicket haul on debut against Canterbury in December 1993, with figures of 6/50 in the first innings and 4/40 in the second innings.[4] He took four wickets in the following match, against Northern Districts,[5] but was dropped after going wicketless in the next match against Central Districts.[6] Auckland's pace attack during the season had included Willie Watson, Murphy Su'a, Chris Pringle, and Justin Vaughan at various stages, all previous Test cricketers.[7] Brown was, however, a more regular selection in limited-overs matches, taking five wickets in five matches at an average of 17.80.[8] At the end of the season, he also played twice for the New Zealand Academy in first-class matches against Northern Districts and Otago, taking six wickets at an average of 13.17.[3]

Umpiring career[edit]
In August 2011, Brown was elevated to New Zealand Cricket's Umpiring "A" Panel for the upcoming 2011–12 season, effectively ranking him in the "top 20" of New Zealand umpires.[9] Having umpired for just two seasons prior to his appointment,[10] he remained on the "A" Panel for the 2012–13 season.[11] Brown umpired his first matches in New Zealand's first-class and one-day competitions during the 2012–13 season, having mainly officiated women's matches and national underage tournaments.[12][13][14] In June 2016, he was added to the International Panel of Umpires and Referees.[15]
On 29 December 2016, he stood in his first One Day International (ODI) match, between New Zealand and Bangladesh.[16] On 6 January 2017, he stood in his first Twenty20 International (T20I) match, also between New Zealand and Bangladesh.[17]
He was one of the twelve umpires to officiate matches in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates.[18] In February 2020, the ICC named him as one of the umpires to officiate in matches during the 2020 ICC Women's T20 World Cup in Australia.[19] He stood in his first Test match on 11 December 2020, between New Zealand and the West Indies.[20]
In September 2023, he was named as one of the sixteen match officials for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.[21][22]

The Cherry cannon (Bulgarian: Черешово топче, Chereshovo topche; Macedonian: Црешево топче, Creševo topče) is a wooden cannon, artillery weapon the body of which is made entirely of acacia or cherry. It has no significant combat value, as the wood shatters under explosion after only a few shots. It was first used by Bulgarian anti-Ottoman revolutionaries in the April Uprising. It was used to arm the under-equipped Bulgarian rebels against the Ottoman army. Balance scale masses and pieces of metal were used as ammunition for the cherry cannon. The first cherry guns were created in the spring of 1876.[1] Later cherry guns were used in the Kruševo Republic and at other places of insurgency during the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903. 
The only original cherry cannon from the April Uprising of 1876 is kept in the museum of Bratsigovo, Bulgaria.[2] The only cherry cannon that survived the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising is the one captured in 1903 by the Ottoman army after the battle with the insurgents near Kruševo, after an entire insurgent company died defending the concession in the escape of the population from Kruševo. That cherry cannon was then transferred by the Turks to the Istanbul Military Museum. In 2003, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Ilinden Uprising, the cherry cannon from the museum in Istanbul was loaned for three months for an exhibition in the Museum of North Macedonia.

The Douglas Bay Horse Tramway (Manx: Raad Yiarn Cabbyl Vaie Ghoolish) on the Isle of Man runs along the seafront promenade for approximately 1 mile (1.6 km), from the southern terminus at the Villa Marina, to Derby Castle station, the southern terminus of the Manx Electric Railway, where the workshops and sheds are located. It is a distinctive tourist attraction. However works have been underway to relay all of the track in 2019 and at present only a third (from the Derby Castle) is usable, with no published completion date for the works.


History[edit]
The tramway was built and initially operated by Thomas Lightfoot, a retired civil engineer from Sheffield. His service was introduced in 1876 between the bottom of what is now Summer Hill and the bottom of Broadway in the centre of today's promenade adjacent to the Villa Marina. In the earliest days the track was expanded, and passing loops and long crossovers added so that by 1891 the line ran double track the entire length of the promenade, much as it does today. From opening it has operated every year, except for a period during the Second World War.[1]
In 1882, Lightfoot sold the line to Isle of Man Tramways Ltd, later the Isle of Man Tramways & Electric Power Co. Ltd, which also owned the Manx Electric Railway. The company went into liquidation in 1900 as a consequence of a banking collapse. The tramway was sold by the liquidator to Douglas Corporation in 1902. Since 1927 the tramway has run in summer only.[1]
In 2015 Douglas Corporation partnered with Isle of Man Transport to introduce the 'Ticketer' system as used across the Island's other public transport systems.[2] On board a Ticketer hand-held unit connects with the island-wide contactless Go Cards and individual tickets can also be purchased.

Closure[edit]
In January 2016, Douglas Corporation announced that the tramway had run for the last time the previous September and that they had closed it as it was not financially viable. The tramway had made a loss of £263,000 in 2015.[3]

Continuance[edit]
After an online petition attracted more than 2,000 signatures, the House of Keys established a committee to look into ways of retaining the iconic horse trams.[4][5] The operation of the tramway was taken over by the Isle of Man Heritage Railways division of the Department of Infrastructure and continued in the 2016, 2017[6] and 2018 summer seasons. However, there are plans to reduce part of the route from double to single track as part of the redevelopment of Douglas Promenade.

Description[edit]
The tramway is 3 ft (914 mm) narrow gauge, double track throughout, running down the middle of the road. Service is provided by 23 tramcars and some 45 horses. There have been several types of tramcar, and at least one of each type has been retained. Most services are maintained by "closed toastracks", with winter saloons and open toastracks also in semi-regular service. In summer, trams are stabled outdoors overnight adjacent to the Terminus Tavern public house, and there is a purpose-built tramshed where they are stored in winter. In 2014 it was announced by the Department of Infrastructure that during 2015 the horse trams would be temporarily suspended while resurfacing work on the promenade continued into its next phase, which runs from Regent Street to Strathallan. However, the plans were later revised, allowing regular horse tram operation to take place in 2015, 2016 and 2017.[7]

Tramcars[edit]
Fleet[edit]
The remaining core of service trams represent a cross-section of various types of car used on the line over the years; notable exceptions from the current fleet are an umbrella car (one of which survives as a souvenir shop elsewhere) and a convertible car, although one of these survives in private ownership. This was the last of three cars from 1935 which were dubbed "tomato boxes" owing to their unconventional appearance. On 27 August 2016, after Douglas council took ownership, six trams were sold at auction, numbers 28, 33, 34, 37, 39 and 40.

Scrapped Fleet[edit]
The tramway amassed at total of 50 cars, the final three arriving as late as 1935. Over the years several of these became surplus to requirements and were scrapped; many were stored in the former cable car depot at York Road, Douglas prior to its demolition to make way for a residential complex in 1990, others were dismantled being surplus to requirements over the years. Nos. 48 and 50 were purchased for possible use as wayside shelters on the Manx Electric Railway and were stored for a time at Derby Castle; the plan however never came to fruition and both vehicles were scrapped in 1982 leaving No.49 as the sole remaining example of this type of tramcar. No.46 was relocated to Nobles Park in Douglas in 1988 where it saw use as a shelter (memorably it carried a black and neon colour scheme latterly, promoting the Palace Lido); it was removed from the island and fully restored for museum display though later scrapped despite having been heavily reconditioned.

Other tramcars[edit]
In addition to those cars remaining in the operational fleet, a number have survived and remained at other locations on the island; No. 14 spent several years at the Clapham Transport Museum until its closure, returning to the island in time for the centenary of the tramway in 1976; it entered the Manx Museum in 1991 where it remains today. No. 22 was converted into a souvenir shop used at Strathallan Crescent, it now resides at a transport museum in the north of the island where it fulfils the same role.

Future[edit]
Despite being the world's last remaining 19th century original horse-drawn passenger tramway and the second-oldest operational rail system on the island, the future of the tramway has been brought into question in recent years.[9] Various plans were submitted by the island's Department of Infrastructure[10] to rebuild the Douglas Promenades. In one version, the tramway would move from its current location in the middle of the roadway to a new single line formation adjacent to the Promenade walkway. The new plans have come in for some criticism from a large group of local residents who object to the siting of the trams near to the walkway. However, in 2019, the tracks were relaid in their previous alignment along the centre of the road. [11] Trams started running again on Friday 29 July 2022, between Strathallan tram depot and Broadway. The service is scheduled to continue until 30 October.[12]

Montagna dei Fiori (Italian: "Mountain of the Flowers") is a mountain group in the Abruzzo, central Italy, forming the Monti Gemelli massif, together with the Montagna di Campli. It is located nearby the boundary between the province of Teramo and the Marche region; due to its proximity to Ascoli Piceno, it is also known as Montagna d'Ascoli.
The highest peak is the Monte Girella, at 1,814 m above the sea level.
The mountain, at an elevation of 1,110 m, is home to the hamlet of San Giacomo, a frazione of Valle Castellana and one of the main ski resorts in the area.

The Royal Typewriter Company is a manufacturer of typewriters founded in January 1904.[3] It was headquartered in New York City with its factory in Hartford, Connecticut.


History[edit]
This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2018) (Learn how and when to remove this message)
The Royal Typewriter Company was founded by Edward B. Hess and Lewis C. Myers in January 1904 in a machine shop in Brooklyn, New York.[3] The next year, Hess and Myers turned to Thomas Fortune Ryan, to whom they demonstrated a prototype typewriter. Their machine had numerous innovations including a friction-free, ball-bearing, one-track rail to support the weight of the carriage, a new paper feed, a lighter and faster typebar action, and complete visibility of the words as they are typed. Ryan put up $220,000 in exchange for financial control.
In March 1906 the first Royal typewriter, the Royal Standard, was sold. The Royal Standard was set apart from its competition by its 'flatbed' design.
With demand increasing, Royal purchased 5¼ acres in Hartford, Connecticut, as the new site for its manufacturing facility. Original plans called for the Royal Typewriter Company Building to have a floor capacity of 250,000 square feet (23,000 m2) and cost $350,000 to build. In 1908, Royal began manufacturing there and in time, Royal and cross town competitor, Underwood Typewriter Company, would make Hartford the “Typewriter Capitol of the World”.
In 1911, Royal introduced the Royal 5 typewriter, which also utilized the "flatbed" design.
Royal's first model utilizing the "upright" design was the Royal 10, which came out in 1914. Original models had two beveled glass panes on each side.
In 1926 Royal introduced the "Roytype" brand name for its line of typewriter ribbons and carbon paper.
In order to promote the new portable Royal president G. E. Smith secured the exclusive sponsorship of the September 23, 1926, Dempsey–Tunney championship fight for $35,000.[4] This boxing match was the first nationwide radio hook-up.
"The Daily News" of New York estimated that 20 million fans from coast to coast listened to the broadcast.
Royal's introduction of its portable line of typewriters was an immediate success and launched the company to become the world's #1 selling typewriter brand.
On October 9, 1926, the "Hartford Daily Courant" reported that Royal had just produced its one millionth typewriter.
To promote the ruggedness of its typewriters, George Edward Smith, president of Royal, bought a Ford-Stout tri-motor airplane in August 1927. This plane, commonly called the Royal Airtruck, dropped over 200 typewriters in crates with parachutes to dealers over the eastern seaboard of the USA on its maiden flight. Royal eventually delivered over 11,000 typewriters this way with only ten being damaged.
In January 1941, Edward B. Hess, one of Royal's founders and vice presidents, died in Orlando, Florida. Hess was a prolific inventor and held over 140 patents relating to the typewriter.
World War II brought tremendous change to Royal. In order to aid the war effort, Royal converted its manufacturing to war work exclusively. Royal manufactured machine guns, rifles, bullets, propellers, and spare parts for airplane engines. It wouldn't be until September 1945 that Royal started typewriter production full-time again and not until December 1948 that it caught up on its pre-war backlog.
Royal's most popular models were in the Quiet Deluxe series of portable typewriters, produced from 1939 until 1959 (with a gap during WWII).[5]
In 1947, Royal produced, in limited quantity, a gold-plated version of its popular Quiet Deluxe model. Ian Fleming, the British novelist who wrote the James Bond novels, used a gold-plated Quiet Deluxe.[6][7][8][9]
Many other writers used a Quiet Deluxe, including Ernest Hemingway,[5] or other models of Royal typewriter, including John Steinbeck.
Other typewriter manufacturers utilized Royal's innovations in their typewriters. In 1947, Royal won patent suits against Remington and LC Smith Corona.
In February 1950, Royal introduced its first electric typewriter.
Lewis C. Myers, the surviving founder of the Royal Typewriter Company, died in Freeport, New York at the age of 84.
Worldwide demand caused Royal to open a new factory in Leiden, the Netherlands, to produce typewriters in 1953.
In April 1954, the Royal typewriter Company announced its plan to merge with McBee, a leading manufacturer of accounting and statistical machines and supplies. By July, Royal stockholders had approved the plan and Royal McBee was formed.
From 1954 to 1964 sales soared from $84.7 million to over $113 million. Royal McBee was consistently listed as a Fortune 500 company.

A Royal FP typewriter used for many years by Pulitzer Prize-winner Herb Caen in preparing his daily column. He called it his "Loyal Royal".
Royal Aristocrat Electric Typewriter
Royal KMG19
In December 1957, Royal announced it had just produced its 10 millionth typewriter. Congratulations were received from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks and the Governor of Connecticut, Abe Ribicoff.
In December 1964, Litton Industries' stockholders approved the acquisition of Royal McBee. The deal became final in March 1965. Litton would change the name of Royal McBee back to Royal Typewriter and reorganize the company into five divisions: Royal Typewriter, Roytype Consumer Products, Roytype Supplies, McBee Systems, and RMB.
October 1966 saw Litton announce plans to acquire the English typewriter producer Imperial, through its Royal Typewriter division.
In January 1969, Litton Industries further cemented its hold on the typewriter market by purchasing the German typewriter manufacturer, Triumph-Adler. Almost immediately, the U.S. government filed an anti-trust suit against Litton accusing it of creating a monopoly. The FTC ruled in March 1973 that Litton had to divest itself of Triumph-Adler. Litton appealed and, in a rare reversal, the FTC issued a ruling in April 1975 stating that Litton could keep Triumph-Adler.
In March 1979, Volkswagen, seeking to diversify, announced its intention to acquire a 55% stake in Triumph-Adler. Included in the deal was Royal Typewriter.
Sales continued to climb and by 1982 sales in North America of Royal and Triumph-Adler totaled over $600 million.
In April 1986, Olivetti, the Italian typewriter/computer manufacturer, announced plans to purchase Triumph-Adler and Royal from Volkswagen. For nearly two decades Royal was a part of the Olivetti family.
By the 1970s and 1980s, the typewriter market matured under the market dominance of large companies from Britain, Europe and the United States.  Before the advent of daisywheel and electronic machines — Royal as well as the other major manufacturers faced strong competition from typewriters from Asia, including Brother Industries and Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan. 
In September 2004, Royal became a private American company again.
Now known as Royal Consumer Information Products Inc., Royal’s product line has evolved to include cash registers, shredders, personal digital assistants (PDAs)/electronic organizers, postal scales, weather stations, and a wide range of original and compatible/remanufactured imaging supplies supporting today’s most popular printers, faxes, and copiers.
As of 2019, Royal is still introducing new typewriters under the Royal brand name.[10]
On 1 November 2021, Royal Consumer Information Products, Inc.[11] (for the Americas) and the Czechia-based Moravia Consulting spol. s r.o.[12] (for all other markets) became the licensees of HP  Development Company, L.P. to continue the development, production, distribution, marketing and support of HP-branded calculators.

Apache Rifles is a 1964 American Western film directed by William Witney and starring Audie Murphy. The film was shot at Bronson Canyon and Red Rock Canyon State Park, California. It was the first of four Audie Murphy films for producer Grant Whylock's Admiral Pictures.


Plot[edit]
Captain Stanton is a renowned Indian Fighter with his animosity stirred by the fact that his career officer father was forced to resign after trusting a group of Indians who broke their word to him. Stanton is sent to the field to relieve the commander of a troop unsuccessfully hunting Apaches who have fled their reservation. Stanton quickly meets with success by having his new troop drop their excess equipment to move faster and longer. He defeats a war party of Apache by luring them with an unescorted wagon loaded with hidden soldiers who engage the enemy until Stanton's mounted troop surround and defeat them. Stanton captures Red Hawk, the son of Chief Victorio and uses him to negotiate a truce with the Apaches promising to stay on their reservation in return for white miners not trespassing on their land to mine gold.
Though the territory remains peaceful, the economy of the settlers and miners faces a serious economic threat when the miners are unable to pay the business interests that advance them money for their mines in return for a percentage of the profits.
Captain Stanton's sympathies gradually change when the miners continue their trespassing. He also is attracted to Dawn Gillis, a courageous missionary teacher who is half Indian herself, and teaches in an Indian school. Stanton ruins his military career by beating up a local troublemaker who makes racist taunts to Dawn, then later engages a group of whites who massacre a group of Indians at the school that leads Stanton to open fire on the whites killing several of them.
A delegation complains about Stanton's behaviour and the economic disaster to the Federal Government in Washington D.C. who send out a new commander named Colonel Perry. The Colonel not only relieves Stanton but dismantles his line of outposts to monitor white entry into the reservation that leads the miners to swarm in and hostilities to resume.
Victorio's Apaches lure the inexperienced Colonel and his men into an ambush but a messenger escapes to the remnants of the Colonel's command of which Stanton takes charge to straighten out the mess.[1]

The Battle of Toropets (also the Battle of the Village of Kamenka) was a battle on May 25, 1609 between the Russian–Swedish detachment and the detachment of Polish hussars and Cossacks of Pan Kernozitsky, which ended in the defeat of the latter.


Background[edit]
Prince Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky sent by Tsar Vasily Shuisky to Novgorod managed to negotiate with the Swedes for military support against the Polish–Lithuanian magnates and False Dmitry II, concluding a Vyborg Treaty with Jacob De la Gardie. Skopin-Shuisky also managed to gather the Russian army and reclaim from the impostor a number of northern cities. In early May, advanced Russian–Swedish detachments marched from Novgorod to clear the way to Torzhok for the main army. Under their onslaught, the leader of the Polish Hussars detachment Kernozitsky left Russa without a fight, which allies occupied on May 20. After that, the invaders suddenly attacked them, but were repelled. The Russian–Swedish detachment, led by Fyodor Chulkov and Evert Horn, continued the offensive and approached Toropets.[1]

Course of the battle[edit]
On May 25, near the village of Kamenka, a battle took place with the hussars and Cossacks of Kernozitsky taken aback. At the first blow of the armored infantry of Horn, Kernozitsky's army fled, and the noble cavalry of Fyodor Chulkov completed the rout.[2] With the remnants of the detachment, Kernozitsky tried to sit outside the walls of the nearby Trinity Nebin Monastery, but was attacked and knocked out of it.[3] The interventionists, leaving artillery, left Toropets, who immediately "set aside" from the "Tushinsky thief".[1]

Aftermath[edit]
After the capture of Toropets by the Russian–Swedish detachment, a chain reaction began. Torzhok, Staritsa, Ostashkov, Rzhev, Zubtsov, Kholm, Nevel, and other northwestern Russian cities "set aside" from False Dmitry II. Thus, for the advance of the army of Skopin-Shuisky and De la Gardie to Moscow, the right flank was reliably covered.[1]

Gordie Howe International Bridge[edit]
When Bishop was Majority Leader of the Michigan Senate, a bill to create the Gordie Howe International Bridge as a companion to the Ambassador Bridge came to him for determination to put it to the Senate floor for a vote. Corporate interests were strongly in favor of the bill, which would partner with Canada to pay for the bridge. Bishop opposed the bridge and did not bring the legislation to a floor vote, saying there were "too many outstanding legal issues and the legislation is too important to push a lame-duck vote."[25] Bishop had received campaign donations from Manuel Moroun, owner of the rival Ambassador Bridge.[26] Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, found another way to make the deal and the project continued without Bishop's support.[27]
Before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives he vowed to vote to block the Gordie Howe International bridge. The Livingston Daily reported "A proposal for the federal government to fund a U.S. customs center has stalled. If elected, Bishop said he wouldn't support federal funding of the customs center."[26]

Bishop, a resident of Rochester, Michigan, is married and has three children.[28] He is a Congregationalist.[29]

Swineshead is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Boston in Lincolnshire, England. It is 7 miles (11 km) west of the town of Boston. The population of the civil parish including Baythorpe was 2,810 at the 2011 census.[1] The parish includes the areas of Swineshead Bridge and North End to the north, Fenhouses and Blackjack to the east, and Drayton to the south.


History[edit]
The lost village of Stenning, or Estovening, mentioned in the Domesday book of 1086[2] is represented by the site of the moated Estovening Hall, which was the manor house of the Holland family. Ralph, founder of the Estovening branch of the Holland family was buried in Swinehead Abbey in 1262.[3]
A medieval motte castle is believed to have been constructed in the 12th century by the de Gresley family, lords of the manor of Swineshead at Manwar Ings. The remains of the castle are visible as substantial earthworks, which are a scheduled monument. The easiest access to the motte is by turning off the A52 at the Manor Farm Shop which is in the Baythorpe region of the village.[4][5]
Swineshead railway station opened in 1847 as part of the Sleaford and Boston Railway.[6]
Hitherto, the parish had formed part of Boston Rural District, in the Parts of Holland. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the Local Government Act of 1888, Holland had been in most respects, a county in itself.

Governance[edit]
It is one of eighteen parishes which, together with Boston, form the Borough of Boston, which is in turn one of the seven districts of the non-metropolitan county of Lincolnshire. The local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganisation of 1 April 1974, which resulted from the Local Government Act 1972. This parish forms part of the Swineshead and Holland Fen electoral ward.

Geography[edit]
Swineshead falls within the drainage area of the Black Sluice Internal Drainage Board.[7]
The A17 used to pass through the village but now passes to the west. The A52 passes close to the east.

Community[edit]
The village has various shops, a post office, a pharmacy and a medical centre.[8] Public houses include the Wheatsheaf, which is a Grade II listed building dating from the 18th century, and the Green Dragon.[9] The village primary school is St Mary's Church of England Primary School.[10]
Swineshead railway station is on the Nottingham-Skegness Line.

Landmarks[edit]
Hardwick House is built on the site of a medieval moated house, possibly a grange, originally owned by Swineshead Abbey, and was listed in the crown bailiff's report when the abbey was dissolved in 1534.[11]

Swineshead, North End Mill
North End Mill is a 3-stage tower windmill built in 1821 which worked until the 1930s, when the sails blew off. It is Grade II listed.[12][13]
The Wesleyan Methodists built a chapel in Swineshead in 1845, which was converted into a Sunday School after a new chapel was built in 1908. This was demolished in 1986 and the former chapel reverted to its original use, and is now a Grade II listed building.[14][15]

St Mary's Church[edit]
St Mary's church
The parish church is a Grade I listed building dedicated to Saint Mary, and dates from the 12th century with later additions and alterations. The chancel was rebuilt in 1848 by Stephen Lavin. The western tower and font are 14th-century. In the chancel is a black marble wall plaque to Sir John Lockton of Swineshead Abbey, who died in 1610.[16]

Cistercian monastery[edit]
Main article: Swineshead Abbey
Swineshead Abbey was founded in 1135 as a Savigniac monastery, but in 1147 was converted to Cistercian by Robert de Gresley. In 1536 it was dissolved and the building of a private house and a park in 1607 destroyed the last traces of it. The site is a scheduled monument.[17][18]

Notable people[edit]
Swineshead is the birthplace of Herbert Ingram, founder of the Illustrated London News and MP for Boston, who was instrumental in bringing the railways and fresh piped water to the village. His son became a lord, and the family were given the Ingram Baronetcy of Swineshead Abbey.[citation needed] Further notable people associated with the village are the abbot, Gilbert of Hoyland,[citation needed] and the goalkeeper Chris Woods.[citation needed]

MT940 is a specific SWIFT message type used by the SWIFT network to send and receive end-of-day bank account statements.[1]
Message Type 940 is the SWIFT standard (Banking Communication Standard) for the electronic transmission of account statement data. In various online banking programs, MT940 is used as an interface to other programs (e.g. for accounting), with which the account statement data are processed further.
The MT formats (Message Types, MT) currently used in the SWIFT community, which also include MT940, are to be replaced in the long term by the XML formats described in the ISO 20022 standard to achieve global unification (see also de:Camt-Format).
