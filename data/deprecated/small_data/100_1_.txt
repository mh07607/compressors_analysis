Numerical analysis procedure
In numerical analysis, von Neumann stability analysis (also known as Fourier stability analysis) is a procedure used to check the stability of finite difference schemes as applied to linear partial differential equations.[1] The analysis is based on the Fourier decomposition of numerical error and was developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory after having been briefly described in a 1947 article by British researchers Crank and Nicolson.[2]
This method is an example of explicit time integration where the function that defines governing equation is evaluated at the current time.
Later, the method was given a more rigorous treatment in an article[3] co-authored by John von Neumann.

Numerical stability[edit]
The stability of numerical schemes is closely associated with numerical error. A finite difference scheme is stable if the errors made at one time step of the calculation do not cause the errors to be magnified as the computations are continued. A neutrally stable scheme is one in which errors remain constant as the computations are carried forward. If the errors decay and eventually damp out, the numerical scheme is said to be stable. If, on the contrary, the errors grow with time the numerical scheme is said to be unstable. The stability of numerical schemes can be investigated by performing von Neumann stability analysis. For time-dependent problems, stability guarantees that the numerical method produces a bounded solution whenever the solution of the exact differential equation is bounded. Stability, in general, can be difficult to investigate, especially when the equation under consideration is nonlinear.
In certain cases, von Neumann stability is necessary and sufficient for stability in the sense of Lax–Richtmyer (as used in the Lax equivalence theorem): The PDE and the finite difference scheme models are linear; the PDE is constant-coefficient with periodic boundary conditions and has only two independent variables; and the scheme uses no more than two time levels.[4] Von Neumann stability is necessary in a much wider variety of cases. It is often used in place of a more detailed stability analysis to provide a good guess at the restrictions (if any) on the step sizes used in the scheme because of its relative simplicity.

Illustration of the method[edit]
The von Neumann method is based on the decomposition of the errors into Fourier series. To illustrate the procedure, consider the one-dimensional heat equation

{\displaystyle r={\frac {\alpha \,\Delta t}{\left(\Delta x\right)^{2}}}}


Then the solution

Define the round-off error

{\displaystyle \epsilon _{j}^{n}}

is a recurrence relation for the error. Equations (1) and (2) show that both the error and the numerical solution have the same growth or decay behavior with respect to time. For linear differential equations with periodic boundary condition, the spatial variation of error may be expanded in a finite Fourier series with respect to

. The time dependence of the error is included by assuming that the amplitude of error

{\displaystyle E_{m}}

 is a function of time. 
Often the assumption is made that the error grows or decays exponentially with time, but this is not necessary for the stability analysis.
If the boundary condition is not periodic, then we may use the finite Fourier integral with respect to

Since the difference equation for error is linear (the behavior of each term of the series is the same as series itself), it is enough to consider the growth of error of a typical term:

if a Fourier integral is used.
As the Fourier series can be considered to be a special case of the Fourier integral, we will continue the development using the expressions for the Fourier integral.
The stability characteristics can be studied using just this form for the error with no loss in generality. To find out how error varies in steps of time, substitute equation (5b) into equation (2), after noting that

The necessary and sufficient condition for the error to remain bounded is that

{\displaystyle 4r\sin ^{2}(\theta /2)\leq 2}

{\displaystyle m}

 (and therefore all 




sin

{\displaystyle \sin ^{2}(\theta /2)}

). The highest value the sinusoidal term can take is 1 and for that particular choice if the upper threshold condition is satisfied, then so will be for all grid points, thus we have

{\displaystyle r={\frac {\alpha \Delta t}{\left(\Delta x\right)^{2}}}\leq {\frac {1}{2}}}

 

















(11)

Equation (11) gives the stability requirement for the FTCS scheme as applied to one-dimensional heat equation. It says that for a given 



Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}

, the allowed value of 



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}

 must be small enough to satisfy equation (10).
Similar analysis shows that a FTCS scheme for linear advection is unconditionally unstable.

Scargill House, 2008
Scargill House is a Christian conference Centre run by the Scargill Movement[1] and located in Wharfedale, in the county of North Yorkshire, England.
Scargill House lies ¾ mile (1.2 km) from the village of Kettlewell and four miles (6.4 km) from Grassington. The nearest market town, Skipton, is 14 miles (22.4 km) away. The house dates from the eighteenth century and is constructed of stone, rendered and colour-washed, under a stone flag roof. The Grade II*-listed chapel was built in 1960.
The woodland at Scargill is accredited by the Forest Stewardship Council as a highly important conservation site.


History[edit]
Scargill House, c. 1901
The recent history of Scargill House[2] can be summarised as follows:

As a house[edit]
Clement Holdsworth bought Scargill House from John Overend Wood in 1900 as a residence from which he shot grouse on Conistone moor and fished for trout on the River Wharfe. It remained in the Holdsworth family for almost 57 years until William Holdsworth decided to live on his Irish estate at Bellinter House and sold the house and estate at auction to the Church of England in November 1957.
The estate was described in the auction catalogue as an "exceptional residential, agricultural and sporting property" extending to 1,050 acres (425 ha), which included:

two stock farms each of about 500 acres (200 ha)
about 70 acres (28 ha) park and afforestation land
properties in nearby Kettlewell
over a mile of trout fishing in the River Wharfe
shooting rights over 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) of Conistone Moor
the right to Pew Sittings in the Parish Church of Kettlewell and share in the Lordship
They[who?] claimed that "the invigorating air and the completely unspoilt grandeur of the surroundings make the Property a most attractive and healthy resort"; and that the grounds of the house included a tree-lined drive, stone-pillared and wrought iron entrance, lawns and an ornamental water garden.

As a Christian community and conference centre[edit]
The chapel at Scargill House Christian conference centre, dating from 1960 and designed by George Pace
The walled garden at Scargill House
The Church of England bought the estate for the establishment of a Christian Community in 1957. In 1959 Scargill became a centre for conferences and events specialising in multi-faith, youth and environmental issues.
Since then, it has been largely reconstructed and extended to cater for the many groups that use its facilities. In 1960, a chapel was built by George Pace of York in a Scandinavian style reflecting the location's history, and is now listed. The chapel was built in limestone with a roof shingled in red cedar.  It has a rectangular plan, with aisles and a serpentine link to the house.  The roof is steeply pitched.  The gables contain mullioned and transomed windows of varying sizes, rising to the apex of the gable.[3]

As part of the Scargill Movement[edit]
In 2008, it was announced that the centre would be closing on 20 July 2008 due to financial difficulties, and profits from the sale of the estate would be used to set up a foundation.[4][5] It was put on the market for £2.5 million.[6]
It was sold in March 2009 to a newly formed registered charity called the Scargill Movement, who are committed to continuing and developing Scargill House in continuation of its original vision, ministry and mission as a “Lee Abbey of the North”. It continues as a Christian centre run by a resident community, providing “a resource for the Church, providing a safe place for individuals and groups to meet with God and one another.”[1] The sale price of £1,295,000 was made possible by an individual donation plus a one-year loan from the Lee Abbey Movement.[2]

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Scargill_House&oldid=1085612072"Erg was a vessel built and owned by Halifax Steamship Ltd. in 1915. She was used to ferry workers across the harbour to vessels under repair during the Second World War. Erg was sunk in the Halifax Harbour three times and is currently located in the Bedford Basin.[1]


Early service[edit]
Erg was originally a steam tug called Sambro and was built by the Halifax Shipyard in 1915. She was one of the earliest steel vessels to be built in Halifax. Sambro was 55 feet long and almost 15 feet wide, with a depth of 7 feet and her maximum tonnage was 28. The tug was originally sunk during the Halifax Explosion of 1917. In 1927, Sambro was raised out of the harbour and was converted from steam to diesel, being given a 4 horsepower engine. With this change, the tug was given a new name and a new purpose. The vessel was renamed Erg and was used as a transport tug, ferrying workers and their equipment from the shipyard to vessels under repair.[2]

Wartime harbour[edit]
Halifax Harbour was an extremely busy port during the Second World War. Because of this, navigational dangers increased with the congestion in the harbour. The Naval Service of Canada, which kept records of the activity in the harbour, advised that from 1940 to 1943, there were at least 12 vessels involved in accidents within Halifax Harbour. Vessels such as Camperdown, Claire Lilley and Nueva Indalucia ran aground, whereas others such as Otter, and Trongate caught fire and sank (or, in the case of Trongate, was made to sink as the flames were completely out of control). In 1940, Herbidean was sunk by the British ship Esmond; a forerunner to the fate of Erg.[3]

Wreck[edit]
On July 6, 1943, Erg was carrying workers and equipment (air compressors and electric generators) through the fog and rain,[2] when she was run down by a Norwegian freighter – a steamship named Norelg (See Convoy SC 94 for more information on this ship). The tug immediately began sinking and as a result, 19 men lost their lives. On July 19, the Royal Canadian Navy utilized the floating crane Lord Kitchener to raise the wreck of Erg so the bodies of the deceased could be recovered. Only 10 bodies were discovered and removed from the wreck. Erg's sinking was and still is considered one of the worst accidents to have taken place in the Halifax Harbour and is the greatest loss of life in regards to a shipwreck within these waters.[4]
Upon inspection, it was decided that Erg was beyond repair and on August 24, 1943,[4] she was taken to her final resting place and sunk for the third and final time.

Final resting place[edit]
The Erg shipwreck site was rediscovered in 2001 in the northern part of the Bedford Basin (near Roach Cove) by the Nova Scotia Exploration Society.[1] The site is a protected heritage site and is visited by many divers. Objects which were recovered from Erg, such as the ships' whistle and portholes are currently on display at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic on Lower Water Street.[4]

15 (fifteen) is the natural number following 14 and preceding 16.


Mathematics[edit]

The 15 perfect matchings of K6
15 as the difference of two positive squares (in orange).
15 is:

The eighth composite number and the sixth semiprime and the first odd and fourth discrete semiprime;[1] its proper divisors are 1, 3, and 5, so the first of the form (3.q),[2] where q is a higher prime.
a deficient number, a lucky number, a bell number (i.e., the number of partitions for a set of size 4), [3] a pentatope number, [4] and a repdigit in binary (1111) and quaternary (33). In hexadecimal, and higher bases, it is represented as F.
with an aliquot sum of 9; within an aliquot sequence of three composite numbers (15,9,4,3,1,0) to the Prime in the 3-aliquot tree.
the second member of the first cluster of two discrete semiprimes (14, 15); the next such cluster is (21, 22).
the first number to be polygonal in 3 ways: it is a triangular number, a hexagonal number,[5] and pentadecagonal number.[6]
a centered tetrahedral number.
the number of partitions of 7.
the smallest number that can be factorized using Shor's quantum algorithm.
the magic constant of the unique order-3 normal magic square.
the number of supersingular primes.
the smallest positive number that can be expressed as the difference of two positive squares in more than one way:[7]

 (see image).
Furthermore,

15's prime factors, (3 and 5), form the first twin-prime pair.
The first 15 superabundant numbers are the same as the first 15 colossally abundant numbers.
In decimal, 15 contains the digits 1 and 5 and is the result of adding together the integers from 1 to 5 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15). The only other number with this property (in decimal) is 27.
There are 15 truncatable primes that are both right-truncatable and left-truncatable:
2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 37, 53, 73, 313, 317, 373, 797, 3137, 3797, 739397 (sequence A020994 in the OEIS)
There are 15 perfect matchings of the complete graph K6 and 15 rooted binary trees with four labeled leaves, both of these being among the types of objects counted by double factorials.
With only two exceptions, all prime quadruplets enclose a multiple of 15, with 15 itself being enclosed by the quadruplet (11, 13, 17, 19).
If a positive definite quadratic form with integer matrix represents all positive integers up to 15, then it represents all positive integers via the 15 and 290 theorems.
15 is the product of distinct Fermat primes, 3 and 5; hence, a regular pentadecagon is constructible with a compass and unmarked straightedge, and 



cos

{\displaystyle \cos {\frac {\pi }{15}}}

 is expressible in terms of square roots.
There are 15 monohedral convex pentagonal tilings, with eight being edge-to-edge.
There are 15 regular and semiregular tilings when infinite (improper) apeirogonal forms are counted: three are regular (with one self-dual), eight are semiregular (with one chiral), and four are apeirogonal (from a total of 8, in-which 4 are duplicates).
Full icosahedral symmetry contains 15 mirror planes (2-fold axes). Specifically, the symmetry order for both the regular icosahedron and regular dodecahedron (which is made of regular pentagons) is 120: equal to sum of the first 15 integers, and the factorial of 5, wherein the sum of the first 5 integers itself is 15. Expressed mathematically:

There are 15 Archimedean solids and 15 Catalan solids when enantiomorphic forms are counted separately.
There are 15 regular honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space: four are compact, and 11 are paracompact.[8]
It is the smallest non-trivial Surprise Number. When 15 is partitioned into 2 parts of digits- smaller part 1 and larger part 5, adding numbers from smaller 1 to larger 5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 = Original Number.
Science[edit]
Seashells from the mollusk Donax variabilis have 15 coloring pattern phenotypes.
The atomic number of phosphorus.
15 Eunomia is the largest Eunomian asteroid in the inner asteroid belt.
Religion[edit]
Sunnism[edit]
The Hanbali Sunni madhab states that the age of fifteen of a solar or lunar calendar is when one's taklif (obligation or responsibility) begins and is the stage whereby one has his deeds recorded.[9]

Judaism[edit]
In the Hebrew numbering system, the number 15 is not written according to the usual method, with the letters that represent "10" and "5" (י-ה, yodh and heh), because those spell out one of the Jewish names of God. Instead, the date is written with the letters representing "9" and "6" (ט-ו, teth and vav)[citation needed]

Albert Abrams (1863–1924), Photo c. 1900
Radionic instruments
Radionics[1]—also called electromagnetic therapy (EMT) and the Abrams method—is a form of alternative medicine that claims that disease can be diagnosed and treated by applying electromagnetic radiation (EMR), such as radio waves, to the body from an electrically powered device.[2]  It is similar to magnet therapy, which also applies EMR to the body but uses a magnet that generates a static electromagnetic field.[2][3]
The concept behind radionics originated with two books published by American physician Albert Abrams in 1909 and 1910.[4] Over the next decade, Abrams became a millionaire by leasing EMT machines, which he designed himself.[2] This so-called treatment contradicts the principles of physics and biology and therefore is widely considered pseudoscientific.[5] The United States Food and Drug Administration does not recognize any legitimate medical use for radionic devices.[2][5][6]
Several systematic reviews have shown radionics is no more effective than placebo and falls into the category of pseudoscience.[7]

History[edit]
Beginning around 1909, Albert Abrams (1864–1924) began to claim that he could detect "energy frequencies" in his patient's bodies. The idea was that a healthy person will have certain energy frequencies moving through their body that define health, while an unhealthy person will exhibit other, different energy frequencies that define disorders. He said he could cure people by "balancing" their discordant frequencies and claimed that his devices are sensitive enough that he could tell someone's religion by looking at a drop of blood.[6] He developed thirteen devices and became a millionaire leasing his devices,[6][8] and the American Medical Association described him as the "dean of gadget quacks".[8]  His devices were definitively proven useless by an independent investigation commissioned by Scientific American in 1924.[9]  He used "frequency" not in its standard meaning, but to describe an imputed energy type, which does not correspond to any property of energy in the scientific sense.[10]
In one form of radionics popularised by Abrams, some blood on a bit of filter paper is attached to a device Abrams called a "dynamizer", which is attached by wires to a string of other devices and then to the forehead of a healthy volunteer, facing west in a dim light. By tapping on his abdomen and searching for areas of "dullness", disease in the donor of the blood is diagnosed by proxy.  Handwriting analysis is also used to diagnose disease under this scheme.[6]  Having done this, the practitioner may use a special device known as an oscilloclast or any of a range of other devices to broadcast vibrations at the patient in order to attempt to heal them.[6]
Other notable quack devices in radionics have included the Ionaco and the Hieronymus machine.[11][12]
Some people claim to have the paranormal or parapsychological ability to detect "radiation" within the human body, which they call radiesthesia. According to the theory, all human bodies give off unique or characteristic "radiations" as do all other physical bodies or objects. Such radiations are often termed an "aura".  Radiesthesia is cited as the explanation of such phenomena as dowsing by rods and pendulums in order to locate buried substances, diagnose illnesses, and the like. Radiesthesia has been described as a mixture of occultism and pseudoscience by critics.[13]
Modern practitioners conceptualize these devices merely as a focusing aid to the practitioner's proclaimed dowsing abilities, and claim that there is no longer any need for the device to have any demonstrable function. Indeed, Abrams' black boxes had no purpose of their own, being merely obfuscated collections of wires and electronic parts.[9]
Contemporary proponents of radionics or EMT claim that where there is an imbalance of electromagnetic fields or frequencies, within the body, that it causes diseases or other illnesses by disrupting the body's chemical makeup. These practitioners believe that applications of electromagnetic energy from outside the body can correct these imbalances.[2]  Like magnet therapy, electromagnetic therapy has been proposed by practitioners of alternative medicine for a variety of purposes, including, according to the American Cancer Society, "ulcers, headaches, burns, chronic pain, nerve disorders, spinal cord injuries, diabetes, gum infections, asthma, bronchitis, arthritis, cerebral palsy, heart disease, and cancer".[2]
Another variant of radionics or EMT is magnetic resonance therapy.[14]

Scientific assessment[edit]
The claims for radionic devices contradict the accepted principles of biology and physics. No scientifically verifiable mechanisms of function for these devices has been posited, and they are often described as "magical" in operation. No plausible biophysical basis for the "putative energy fields" has been proposed, and neither the fields themselves nor their purported therapeutic effects have been convincingly demonstrated.[15]
No radionic device has been found efficacious in the diagnosis or treatment of any disease, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not recognize any legitimate medical uses of any such device.[2] According to David Helwig in The Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine, "most physicians dismiss radionics as quackery".[5]
Internally, a radionic device is very simple, and may not even form a functional electrical circuit.[9] The wiring in the analysis device is simply used as a mystical conduit.[16] A radionic device does not use or need electric power, though a power cord may be provided, ostensibly to determine a "base rate" on which the device operates to attempt to heal a subject.[17] Typically, little attempt is made to define or describe what, if anything, is flowing along the wires and being measured.  Energy in the physical sense, i.e., energy that can be sensed and measured, is viewed as subordinate to intent and "creative action".[16]
Claims about contemporary EMT devices are similar to those made by the older generation of "radionics" devices, and are also not supported by evidence and are also pseudoscientific.[18][19][7]  Even though some of the early works in bioelectromagnetics have been applied in clinical medicine, there is no relationship between alternative devices or methods that use externally applied electrical forces and the use of electromagnetic energy in mainstream medicine.[2]
The American Cancer Society says that "relying on electromagnetic treatment alone and avoiding conventional medical care may have serious health consequences". In some cases the devices may be ineffective and harmful.[2]

Reviews[edit]
Several systematic reviews have shown EMT is not a useful therapy:

In 2009 no significant difference from control was found for management of pain or stiffness for osteoarthritis.[20]
In 2011 a systematic literature review on the use of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMT) body mats used in a wide range of conditions found insufficient evidence for them to be recommended and recommended further high‐quality, double‐blind trials.[21]
In 2014 insufficient for the efficacy of EMT as a therapy for urinary incontinence.[22]
In 2014 EMT was found to have no difference from control for stimulation of bone growth in acute fractures.[23]
In 2015 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found no evidence that EMT was useful in healing pressure ulcers[24] or venous stasis ulcers.[25]
A 2016 guideline, in addition to reviews in 2016, 2013 and 2022, did not find EMT useful for various forms of pain.[26][27][28]
EMT devices[edit]
The FDA has banned some commercially available EMT devices. In 2008 the VIBE machine from Vibe Technologies had a Class I recall that was completed in 2012.[29]
Other ineffectual EMT therapy devices that have been marketed include:

"BioResonance Tumor Therapy", developed by Martin Keymer and purported to stimulate the P53 gene to cure cancer.[2]
"Cell Com System", a device created by Hugo Nielsen that is used on hands and feet to regulate communications between cells in the body.[2]
"Rife machine", a device created by Royal Rife, which is also known as frequency therapy or frequency generator and marketed as treating cancer.[2]
"Zapping Machine", a device created by Hulda Regehr Clark, claimed to cure cancer by using low-level electrical current to kill parasites within the body that are supposed to cause cancer.[2]
"EMP Pad", a device manufactured by EMPPad, advertised by Noel Edmonds, that is claimed to slow ageing, reduce pain, lift depression and stress and tackles cancer.[30]
"UVLrx", a device manufactured by UVLrx Therapeutics that provides ultraviolet treatment of blood to treat HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, Dengue fever and Lyme disease, as well as many other conditions.[31]
"ReBuilder", a device manufactured by Rebuilder, is claimed to reverse neuropathy (nerve damage) by using tiny electrical signals to wake up nerves.[32]
"Electro Physiological Feedback Xrroid (EPFX)", a device manufactured by Desiré Dubounet that is claimed to cure cancer, as well as other serious conditions by sending electromagnetic frequencies into the body.[33]

Chris Nallen (born April 9, 1982) is an American professional golfer.
Nallen was born in Queens, New York but he grew up in Hackettstown, New Jersey. In high school, Nallen went to Blair Academy where he excelled as one of top golfers in the state. He played college golf at the University of Arizona where he won six tournaments and was a four-time All-American.[1] He also won the 2003 Northeast Amateur and the 2004 Dogwood Invitational. He played on the U.S. teams in the 2003 and 2004 Palmer Cups and the 2003 Walker Cup.[2] He was a semi-finalist in 2004 U.S. Amateur.[3] He turned professional after the U.S. Amateur.
In his first pro start, Nallen finished T-49 at the 2004 Buick Championship. In October 2004, he Monday-qualified for the Gila River Classic at Wild Horse Pass Resort on the Nationwide Tour by shooting a round of 63.[4] He shot 60 in the first round and led wire-to-wire for his first pro win.[4] He was the 17th Monday qualifier to win, the 10th player to win in his first career start and the 19th player to lead wire-to-wire.[4] He was the first player to accomplish all three feats simultaneously.[5] He has played on the Nationwide Tour since that win.

Phaeoclavulina abietina, commonly known as the green-staining coral, is a coral mushroom in the family Gomphaceae. It is characterized by the green staining reaction it develops in response to bruising or injury.


Taxonomy[edit]
The species was first described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1794 as Clavaria abietina.  It is commonly known as the "green-staining coral".[9] It was classified in the genus Ramaria (in the subgenus Echinoramaria),[7] until molecular phylogenetic showed that Ramaria was polyphyletic.[10]

Description[edit]
Fruit bodies are leathery, and brittle when dry. They are small, measuring 2–5 cm (3⁄4–2 in) tall by 1–3 cm (3⁄8–1+1⁄8 in) wide, and branch from the central stem up to five times. The slender branches are slightly flattened or spreading, and forked or crested near the top. The color of the fruit body is medium yellow green to light olive, but will bruise a darker olive green to dark olive green. The stem is short, and have a mat of mycelia at its base, which is attached to rhizomorphs that branch into the substrate. The odor of the mushroom tissue ranges from indistinct to earthy, and it tastes initially sweet, then somewhat bitter.[9] The species is inedible.[11]
The spores are dark orange-yellow when collected in mass. Spores are pip-shaped to broadly elliptical, with one oblique end; their dimensions are 6–9 by 3.5–4.5 μm.[7] The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are typically four-spored, with the spores attached by sterigmata up to 7 μm long.[9]

Similar species[edit]
Similar in appearance is Ramara invalii, but this species does not stain when bruised.[9]

Habitat and distribution[edit]

Fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups (sometimes arranged in rows)[7] on the ground in duff of coniferous forests. In North America, it is found in the Pacific Northwest[9] and Mexico.[12] It is also found in Europe.[13]

Note:

[A] Also included on previous albums.
1 Although "Reason to Believe" was the A-side, the single was listed on the UK chart as "Maggie May/Reason to Believe".
2 "In a Broken Dream" was credited to Python Lee Jackson and released as a single in late 1969. However, the single did not chart in the UK until 1972.
3 "What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me)" was released as a double A-side with "Angel" in the UK and Ireland.
4 "You Can Make Me Dance ..." was credited to Rod Stewart/Faces, at least in the UK.[71]
5 "Sailing" was in 1976 used as the theme music for the BBC documentary series Sailor, about HMS Ark Royal, and when it was subsequently re-released it reached number 3 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1987, the song made a new chart appearance in the UK when re-released as a charity single after the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, reaching number 41 on the chart. The 1987 release also made number 30 in Ireland.
6 "The First Cut Is the Deepest" and "I Don't Want to Talk About It" were released as a double A-side in the UK in 1977. Internationally, the former was released in 1977 and the latter in 1979. However, a newly recorded version of "I Don't Want to Talk About It", included on the Stewart anthology Storyteller, was a number 2 hit on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 1990; it did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100 as it was not available as a retail single.

Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee (JAFRC) was a nonprofit organization to provide humanitarian aid to refugees of the Spanish Civil War.[1][2]


History[edit]
Ambulance of American Medical Bureau in Spain (1937)
In 1941, the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee was formed by Lincoln Battalion veterans of the Spanish Civil War to provide aid to refugees Who were Spanish Loyalists from Francoist Spain.[2]  It superseded previous groups, including the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy and the American Medical Bureau, the latter of which Barsky had founded in 1936.[1] Specifically, the JAFRC was "dedicated to the rescue and relief of thousands of anti-fascist fighters trapped in Vichy, France, and North Africa' so that they might "return to the active fight against the Axis."
The JAFRC established a fundraising organization, the Spanish Refugee Appeal of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee.[1][3] Dorothy Parker took charge of the fundraising of the committee, which soon attracted the support of Leonard Bernstein, Albert Einstein, Lillian Hellman, Langston Hughes, and Orson Welles.[4]
In 1942, the committee was licensed to do so in Vichy France by President Franklin Roosevelt's wartime administration and was then granted tax-exempt status.[5]: 70 
In 1946, the committee began to face  relentless criticism and scrutiny from federal government organizations. In 1948, the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now known as the Internal Revenue Service) revoked the JAFRC's tax-exempt status. Following this, the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB) attempted to compel the JAFRC to register as a communist front organization.n.[1]
In April 1951, Allan Rosenberg successfully argued for the committee in Anti-Fascist Committee v. McGrath before the US Supreme Court.[6]
In 1955, the committee's board voted to disband.[1]

Amalgamation and Disbandment[edit]
South Coast Commando was amalgamated with Durban South Commando in 1994. 
This new unit, along with all other Commando units was however disbanded after a decision by South African President Thabo Mbeki to disband all Commando Units.[1][2] The Commando system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 "because of the role it played in the apartheid era", according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula.[3]

November 21, 2012 (2012-11-21)
Running time2 minutes 55 seconds
Gangnam for Freedom is a 2012 video clip produced by the British sculptor Anish Kapoor. It is a parody of the international K-pop hit single "Gangnam Style", and it was created to advocate the freedom of expression as well as to support the Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei, whose parody of "Gangnam Style" was blocked by Chinese authorities immediately after it was uploaded. The video features appearances by the staff of numerous contemporary art museums as well as human rights activists from Liberty, Index on Censorship, The Helen Bamber Foundation, and Amnesty International.[1]


Background[edit]
"草泥马 style" (literally, "Grass Mud Horse Style"), was uploaded onto YouTube and other Chinese websites by the political activist and dissident Ai Weiwei. In his parody, Ai Weiwei dances "Gangnam Style" with a pair of handcuffs as a symbol of his arrest by Chinese authorities in 2011. According to the Associated Press, government authorities had removed the video from almost all Chinese websites the next day.[2][3] In an interview with Reuters, Ai Weiwei remarked, "After we had uploaded it, a few hours later...we found that a lot of people, tens of thousands, had already watched it. Now, in China, it has already been totally removed, deleted entirely, and you can't see it in China".[4]
In order to show his solidarity with Ai Weiwei and to protest against censorship by the Chinese government, Anish Kapoor enlisted the aid of some prominent British artists, including Tom Phillips and Mark Wallinger to produce another parody of "Gangnam Style".[5] It was also produced to support other censored intellectuals and artists including Russia’s jailed feminist punk collective Pussy Riot,[6] the Bahraini human-rights activist Abdulhadi al-Khawaja,[7] and also to mark the International Day to End Impunity on 23 November.[8]

Our film aims to make a serious point about freedom of speech and freedom of expression. It is our hope that this gesture of support for Ai Weiwei and all prisoners of conscience will be wide-ranging and will help to emphasise how important these freedoms are to us all.— Anish Kapoor[9]
Synopsis[edit]
The video clip begins by showing Anish Kapoor lying on the floor in a bright pink shirt and his hands being restrained by a pair of handcuffs. Then, a few shots from Ai Weiwei's parody of "Gangnam Style" are shown. Kapoor then performs the dance moves of "Gangnam Style". 
At 0:29, a group of activists holds up a sign which reads, "Human Rights For China". An Amnesty International placard shown at 1:31 reads "End repression. Allow expression".[10] Other participants dance around the room wearing black-and-white masks of Ai Weiwei and Gao Zhisheng,[11] a Chinese human rights lawyer who went missing in 2009. In the second part of the video, footage shows staff from contemporary art museums in the United States and elsewhere performing the dance moves of "Gangnam Style" in solidarity with imprisoned human rights activists.[11] In another scene, a line of masked participants are shown with their middle fingers raised[12] to symbolize their defiance against state censorship.
Towards the end of the video, a woman approaches Kapoor and frees him by removing his sunglasses. Kapoor then removes the duct tape from his mouth, and the video ends with a list of people "still being persecuted, imprisoned, tortured, and forced into exile because of their expression".

Reception[edit]
Kate Allen, the Director of Amnesty International UK, described the video as "a wonderful tribute to Ai Weiwei" and she also expressed hope that those who have watched the video would "reflect on the limits placed on freedom of expression in China".[13]
Ai Weiwei himself interpreted the video as a "good inspiration for young people."[14]

Credits and personnel[edit]
The video was choreographed by Akram Khan, an English dancer of Bangladeshi descent.[15] It features human rights activists from Amnesty International[13] and was recorded in Kapoor’s studio in London.[16] About 400[14] dancers and art patrons contributed to the production of the video, as well as staff from art museums such as:

Museum of Modern Art[17]
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum[9]
New Museum[6]
Philadelphia Museum of Art[18]
Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego[9]
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden[19]
Brooklyn Museum[19]
Los Angeles County Museum of Art[6]
Serpentine Gallery[11]
Tate[20]
Other prominent figures who participated in the recording of the video include:

Tamara Rojo,[21] Artistic Director of the English National Ballet
Hanif Kureishi,[22]  an English playwright, filmmaker and novelist
Mark Wallinger,[22] an English artist best known for his  installation artwork State Britain
Deborah Bull,[22] Creative Director of the Royal Opera House.
Patrick Brill,[23]   a British contemporary artist better known by his pseudonym Bob and Roberta Smith.
Tom Phillips,[23] an English painter, printmaker  and collagist.

Amorium, also known as Amorion (Greek: Ἀμόριον), was a city in Phrygia, Asia Minor[1] which was founded in the Hellenistic period, flourished under the Byzantine Empire, and declined after the Arab sack of 838. It was situated on the Byzantine military road from Constantinople to Cilicia.[2] Its ruins and höyük ('mound, tumulus') are located under and around the modern village of Hisarköy, 13 kilometers east of the district center, Emirdağ, Afyonkarahisar Province, Turkey.[3][4]
Arab/Islamic sources refer to the city as ʿAmmūriye. Under Ottoman rule the site, which never regained importance, was called Hergen Kale or Hergen Kaleh.[1]


History[edit]
Antiquity[edit]
The city minted its own coins beginning between 133 BC to 27 BC until the 3rd century AD, indicating its maturity as a settlement and military importance during the pre-Byzantine period.[5] Amorium then must have been prestigious and prosperous. But early historical records that mention the city are strictly limited to a reference by Strabo, although it is expected that new discoveries will shed light on the city's Roman period and before.

Byzantine period[edit]
Gold solidus of Emperor Michael II the Amorian and his son Theophilos.
The city was fortified by the emperor Zeno in the 5th century, but did not rise to prominence until the 7th century.[6] Its strategic location in central Asia Minor made the city a vital stronghold against the armies of the Umayyad Caliphate following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. The city was first attacked by Muawiyah I in 646. It capitulated to ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Khalid in 666 and was occupied by Yazid I in 669, then retaken by Constans II's general Andreas.[2] Over the next two centuries, it remained a frequent target of Muslim raids (razzias) into Asia Minor, especially during the great sieges of 716 and 796. It became capital of the thema of Anatolikon soon after. In 742-743, it was the main base of Emperor Constantine V against the usurper Artabasdos, and in 820, an Amorian, Michael II, ascended the Byzantine throne, establishing the Amorian dynasty. This began the period of the city's greatest prosperity, when it became the largest city in Asia Minor. Its status however as the native city of the reigning dynasty also spelled its doom: in 838, the Caliph Al-Mu'tasim launched a campaign specifically against the city, which was captured and razed, an episode recounted in a poem of Abu Tammam.[2]
The town was rebuilt, but was burned by Thamal al-Dulafi in 931. Nonetheless, it remained an active Byzantine city at least into the 11th century.[7] Following the Battle of Manzikert, it was devastated by the Seljuks and a large proportion of its inhabitants were killed.[8] Emperor Alexios I Komnenos defeated the Seljuks at Amorium in 1116.
It remained an important place in the 12th–14th centuries according to al-Idrisi and Hamdallah Mustawfi.[2]

Bishopric[edit]
Amorium was a bishopric at latest by 431,[1] when its bishop, Abraham or Ablabius, was at the Council of Ephesus. The acts of the earlier First Council of Constantinople (381) were signed by a priest, Tyrannus, of Amorium. Other bishops were Mysterius, who took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Theodorus, in the Trullan Council of 692, Theodosius, in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and Bessarion in the Council of Constantinople (879). Theophilus was part of the mission that Photius sent to Rome about 20 years earlier.
In the Notitiae Episcopatuum of Pseudo-Epiphanius (c. 640), Amorium appears as a suffragan of Pessinus, capital of Galatia Salutaris. It appears with the same rank in another of the end of the 8th century. Soon afterwards, presumably as a result of citizens of Amorium taking the imperial throne, it became a metropolitan see with, as shown by the early 10th-century Notitiae Episcopatuum of Leo VI the Wise, five suffragan sees: Philomelium, Claneus, Docimium, Polybotus. and Pissia.[9] There is no longer any mention of the see in the 14th-century Notitiae Episcopatuum.[10][11][12]
No longer a residential bishopric, Amorium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.[13]

42 Martyrs[edit]
Main article: 42 Martyrs of Amorium
Following the 838 sack, 42 officers and notables of Amorium were taken as hostages to Samarra (today in Iraq). Refusing to convert to Islam, they were executed there in 845, and became canonized as the "42 Martyrs of Amorium".[14]

Excavations[edit]
Amorium's site was long unknown, though its name appears on many maps of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was rediscovered by Richard Pococke in 1739, but the first visit by a western scholar was by the English geologist William Hamilton in 1836; subsequently, maps placed it more accurately.[15]
In 1987, R.M. Harrison of Oxford University conducted a preliminary survey of the site, with excavations being started in 1988. From its inception the Amorium Excavations Project has been principally concerned with investigating post-classical, Byzantine Amorium.[16] During 1989 and 1990, an intensive surface survey was conducted of the man-made mound in the upper city. In 2001, Ali Kaya made a geophysical survey of the church found in the upper city, although a full excavation has yet to be undertaken. The Project is sponsored by the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara and funded by grants from various institutions in the United States including the Adelaide and Milton De Groot Fund at The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Friends of Amorium.[17][failed verification]
After more than 20 years of British led excavation at Amorium, fieldwork restarted in 2014 with a new Turkish team under the direction of Doçent Doktor Zeliha Demirel Gökalp of Anadolu University, based at Eskisehir.[18] Amorium Excavations Project retains its character of international collaboration with foreign institutions, like the Institute of Mediterranean Studies of Foundation for Research & Technology – Hellas.[19]

1902 oil painting of Kierkegaard, by Luplau Janssen.
Søren Kierkegaard was a Danish philosopher whose influence and reception varied widely and may be roughly divided into various chronological periods. Reactions were anything but uniform, and proponents of various ideologies attempted to appropriate his work quite early.
Kierkegaard's reputation as a philosopher was first established in his native Denmark with his work Either/Or.[1] Henriette Wulff, in a letter to Hans Christian Andersen, wrote, "Recently a book was published here with the title Either/Or! It is supposed to be quite strange, the first part full of Don Juanism, skepticism, et cetera, and the second part toned down and conciliating, ending with a sermon that is said to be quite excellent. The whole book attracted much attention. It has not yet been discussed publicly by anyone, but it surely will be. It is actually supposed to be by a Kierkegaard who has adopted a pseudonym...."[1]
Kierkegaard's fame in Denmark increased with each publication of his philosophical works, including Fear and Trembling and Philosophical Fragments, and culminating in his magnum opus, the Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments. However, Kierkegaard's attack upon Christendom, represented by the Danish National Church near the end of his life, did not endear him to many in the clergy and theological circles. After his death, his original manuscripts were bequeathed by his one-time fiancée, Regine Olsen for posterity. She later donated most of his writings to the Danish Royal Library where they continue to be stored.
Kierkegaard's thought gained a wider audience with the translation of his works into German, French, and English.


Kierkegaard and philosophy and theology[edit]
The Søren Kierkegaard Statue in the Royal Library Garden in Copenhagen
Many 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right.[2] Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran,[3] he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November and in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church with a feast day on 8 September.
Philosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard include Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Barth, Simone de Beauvoir, Niels Bohr, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Emil Brunner, Martin Buber, Rudolf Bultmann, Albert Camus, Martin Heidegger, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Reinhold Niebuhr, Franz Rosenzweig, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gilles Deleuze, Joseph Soloveitchik, Paul Tillich, Malcolm Muggeridge, Thomas Merton, Miguel de Unamuno.[4] Paul Feyerabend's epistemological anarchism in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard's idea of subjectivity as truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard,[5] claiming that "Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls".[5] Karl Popper referred to Kierkegaard as "the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy".[6]

Kierkegaard and psychology[edit]
Kierkegaard had a profound influence on psychology. He is widely regarded as the founder of Christian psychology and of existential psychology and therapy.[7] Existentialist (often called "humanistic") psychologists and therapists include Ludwig Binswanger, Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May. May based his The Meaning of Anxiety on Kierkegaard's The Concept of Anxiety. Kierkegaard's sociological work Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age critiques modernity.[8] Ernest Becker based his 1974 Pulitzer Prize book, The Denial of Death, on the writings of Kierkegaard, Freud and Otto Rank. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of postmodernism.[9]

Kierkegaard and literature[edit]
Kierkegaard influenced 19th-century literature writers as well as 20th-century literature. August Strindberg (1843-1912) found inspiration in Kierkegaard and the famous Norwegian dramatist and poet Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) clearly seems to have been inspired by the Dane in famous works such as Brand. The other great Norwegian national writer and poet Bjornstjerne Bjornson (1832-1910) was also deeply inspired by Kierkegaard.[10] Finally the celebrated Norwegian artist Edvard Munch (1863-1944) closely studied key concepts such as anxiety, and this influence is notable in some of his iconic paintings such as The Scream.[11]
Other figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka,[12] David Lodge, Flannery O'Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike.[13] Kierkegaard's work The Diary of a Seducer has been re-published several times, including Princeton University Press' translation with John Updike's foreword and Penguin Books' series Great Loves.

Kierkegaard after World War I[edit]
Kierkegaard's present stature in the English-speaking world owes much to the exegetical writings and improved Kierkegaard translations by the American theologian Walter Lowrie, the University of Minnesota philosopher David F. Swenson, and the Danish translators Howard and Edna Hong. Anthony Rudd's book Kierkegaard and the Limits of the Ethical and Alasdair MacIntyre's discussion of Kierkegaard in After Virtue and A Short History of Ethics did much to facilitate Kierkegaard's legacy in ethical thought in analytic philosophy.
Kierkegaard's influence on continental philosophy increased dramatically after the First and Second World Wars, especially among the German existenz thinkers and French existentialists. Jean-Paul Sartre, Emmanuel Levinas, and Karl Barth all owe a heavy debt to Kierkegaard. Paul Ricoeur and Judith Butler wrote monographs drawing new attention to Kierkegaard's work, and a 1964 UNESCO colloquium on Kierkegaard in Paris ranks as one of the most important events for a generation's reception of Kierkegaard, which included a keynote speaker, Sartre who gave his lecture The Singular Universal, which solidified Kierkegaard's influence over existentialism.[14] In America, interest in Kierkegaard was revived from the 1980s onwards, particularly by the American philosopher and curator of the Kierkegaard Library at St. Olaf College Gordon Marino, who has devoted several books and essays to Kierkegaard. In Kierkegaard's native Denmark, the Danish people hosted his 200th anniversary of Kierkegaard's birth in Copenhagen in May 2013.[15]
Kierkegaard has also influenced members of the analytical philosophy tradition, most notably Ludwig Wittgenstein, who considered Kierkegaard to be "the most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was a saint."[16] To some degree, Kierkegaard can be seen as one of the few philosophers to whom the simple analytic/continental divide does not fully apply.
Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research. In his journals, he wrote:

"What the age needs is not a genius—it has had geniuses enough, but a martyr, who in order to teach men to obey would himself be obedient unto death. What the age needs is awakening. And therefore someday, not only my writings but my whole life, all the intriguing mystery of the machine will be studied and studied. I never forget how God helps me and it is therefore my last wish that everything may be to his honour."[17]
Kierkegaard and feminism[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (April 2020)
Kierkegaard's relationship to feminism is a troublesome one, Kierkegaard has been described as misogynistic, making "snide comments about woman’s nature, mocking with utmost irony her “great abilities” and sneering at the possibility of her emancipation" although Dera Sipe of Villanova University states that viewing Kierkegaard as a "straight misogynist is highly problematic".[18]
In her paper Kierkegaard and Feminism: A Paradoxical Friendship, Sipe commends Kierkegaard for taking "a hammer to the cold foundations of traditional Western philosophy" and introducing existentialism which feminism has adopted and thrived in.[18] She then states that due to Kierkegaard's rampant use of Pseudonyms one must separate Kierkegaard from his Pseudonyms.[a] Sipe argues that it "would be of more benefit to feminism not to read Kierkegaard in search of his own personal stance on the woman question, but rather to read him in an exploratory manner as one who has exposed new avenues of thought, new ways of examining the woman question".[18] Sipe, after examining his essay on the suffragette movement and the seducer's diary and their misogynistic content, then pivots towards Kierkegaard's view on the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus and Sarah, the young daughter of Raguel and Edna both of whom Kierkegaard considers to be knights of faith.[18] She states that from these examples it is clear that Kierkegaard (or at least Johannes de Silentio) did hold great respect for women.[18]

International reception[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (December 2015)
In France[edit]
Kierkegaard was first mentioned in a French publication in 1856 in Revue des deux mondes (English: Review of the Two Worlds) in an article detailing the state of Danish politics and culture which described his influence on the Danish church as having "bewildered many minds and troubled many weak or fearful consciences". The article also detailed the controversy around his funeral.[19]
The first translation of Kierkegaard into French was published in 1886 by Johannes Gøtzsche, with a preface by the theologian Hans-Peter Kofoed-Hansen. The work translated was Two Minor Ethical-Religious Essays (French: En quoi l'homme de génie diffère-t-il de l'apôtre? Traité éthique-religieux).[19]
Subsequent translations of Kierkegaard into French include those produced by Paul Petit, who produced a French translation of the Concluding Unscientific Postscript in 1941, as well as a translation of the Philosophical Fragments, published posthumously in 1947.[19]

In Germany[edit]
The earliest mentions of Kierkegaard's work in German publications were written by Andreas Frederik Beck, himself Danish and one of the attendees at Kierkegaard's oral dissertation defence. There was an anonymous German review of Philosophical Fragments published in 1845 which subsequent scholarship believes was written by Beck. Kierkegaard responded to Beck's criticisms in a footnote published in the followup to the Fragments, the Concluding Unscientific Postscript. Another early mention of Kierkegaard in German is from Johann Georg Theodor Grässe, who included Kierkegaard briefly in an 1848 review of European literature.[20]
In 1856, the Bavarian-born conservative politician and historian Joseph Edmund Jörg wrote an article discussing religious movements and events in Scandinavian history. The Catholic Jörg praised Kierkegaard's relentless attack on the Danish Lutheran Church, but suggests that Kierkegaard should perhaps have seen Catholicism as a final step in his religious development.[20]
Early translations of Kierkegaard into German were restricted to his post-1850 material (The Moment, the attack on the Lutheran Church) and appeared in the 1860s. The Tübingen-trained pastor, Albert Bärthold, studied Kierkegaard under Johann Tobias Beck and published translations of a number of Kierkegaard's works.[20]
Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen (1848-1895) recognized Georg Brandes article on Soren Kierkegaard, as well as The Corsair in his March, 1888 article Scandinavian Literature in The Chautauquan. He notes that both Either/Or and Stages on the Path of Life had already been translated into German by that time.[21]
The most significant translation work was conducted by Christoph Schrempf, another student of J.T. Beck. Schrempf's first translations appeared in 1890 and by 1922, he had completed translations of the entire set of Kierkegaard's published writings. His translations have been criticised repeatedly as unreliable: Heiko Schulz referred to them as "repeatedly revised, highly idiosyncratic, and at times breathtakingly free renditions of the Kierkegaardian texts". Schrempf also spread a view of Kierkegaard significantly out-of-step from the mainstream, interpreting Kierkegaard's "subjectivity as truth" as a justification for his own religious disbelief.[20]

Ultra low velocity zones (ULVZs) are patches on the core-mantle boundary that have extremely low seismic velocities. The zones are mapped to be hundreds of kilometers in diameter and tens of kilometers thick. Their shear wave velocities can be up to 30% lower than surrounding material. The composition and origin of the zones remain uncertain. The zones appear to correlate with edges of the African and Pacific large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs)[1] as well as the location of hotspots.
[2]
[3]


Discovery and constraints[edit]
ULVZs are discovered by the delay and scattering of body waves that reflect and diffract on or are refracted by the core-mantle boundary. Different body waves types give different constraints on the dimensions or velocity contrasts of the ULVZ. Even though ULVZs are discovered in places, it remains difficult to map out their extent and constrain their density and velocity. Usually trade-offs between various parameters exist. In general though, ULVZs appear to be a hundred to a thousand kilometers across and tens of kilometers thick (although existing thinner or smaller ULVZs might fall below the resolution of seismology). Their shear wave velocity reduction is on the order of −10 to −30% and the compressional wave velocity reduction tends to be weaker.[3][4][5]

Composition and origin[edit]
ULVZs are hypothesized to be enriched in iron, be partially molten[6] or a combination of both, or result of the presence of carbon. Different scenarios have been proposed for the iron enrichment: iron could be leaking from the core,[7] have accumulated over past subduction,[8] or be remnants of a basal magma ocean.[9] Both silicate perovskite[10] and periclase[11] (which are thought to be present in the lowermost mantle) show reduced velocities with increasing iron at these pressures and temperatures.
Experiments with iron and water under the same conditions form an iron peroxide FeO2Hx that will contribute to ULVZ.[12]

Distribution and dynamics[edit]
ULVZs have higher density than their surroundings to remain stable on the core-mantle boundary. In a general mantle convection setting, the density contrast as well as the amount of material available would control the morphology/shape of the ULVZ.[13] So far a range of sizes for ULVZs has been found.[14]
The location and shape of the ULVZs can also be controlled by the presence of thermo-chemical piles (or LLSVPs). The denser ULVZ material heaps up at the edges of these piles.[1]

Hawaiian ULVZ[edit]
The Hawaiian ULVZ appears to be the largest ULVZ mapped to date.[4] It sits on the core-mantle boundary slightly to the west of the Hawaiian hotspot at the northern boundary of the Pacific large low-shear-velocity province. It is mapped out to be roughly 1000 km across and 20 km high. Its large aspect ratio dynamically suggests it is very dense.[13] Its shear wave velocity reduction is roughly 20% compared to surrounding material. It remains speculative if there is a correlation between this large ULVZ and the presence of the strongest hotspot flux at the surface; potentially the ULVZ could be an anchor to a whole-mantle plume.

Samoan ULVZ[edit]
The Samoan is another mega-ultra-low velocity zone which lies directly beneath the Samoa hotspot.[5][15] This zone is roughly 800 by 250 km (roughly the size of Florida) and is 10–15 km high. Its material appears 45% slower in shear wave velocity, 15% slower in compressional wave velocity and 10% denser. Additionally, the ULVZ appears to lie in a gap of the Pacific LLSVP [16] (not represented in the illustration here), leading to the hypothesis that this slow material is pushed to the center by surrounding large piles.

The Amsterdam Compiler Kit (ACK) is a retargetable compiler suite and toolchain written by Andrew Tanenbaum and Ceriel Jacobs, since 2005 maintained by David Given.[1] It has frontends for the following programming languages: C, Pascal, Modula-2, Occam, and BASIC.


History[edit]
The ACK's notability stems from the fact that in the early 1980s it was one of the first portable compilation systems designed to support multiple source languages and target platforms.[2][3]
The ACK was known as MINIX's native compiler toolchain until the MINIX userland was largely replaced by that of NetBSD (MINIX 3.2.0) and Clang was adopted as the system compiler.
It was originally closed-source software (that allowed binaries to be distributed for MINIX as a special case), but in April 2003 it was released under the BSD licenses.

Working principle[edit]
Maximum portability is achieved by using an intermediate language using bytecode, called EM. Each language front-end produces EM object files, which are then processed through several generic optimisers before being translated by a back-end into native machine code.
ACK comes with a generic linker and librarian capable of manipulating files in the ACK's own a.out-based format; it will work on files containing EM code as well as native machine code. However, EM code cannot be linked to native machine code without translating the EM binary first.

Target processors[edit]
ACK backends can produce native machine code for a wide range of CPUs, even starting with small 8 bit CPUs.

I due colonnelli (internationally released as The Two Colonels) is a 1963 Italian comedy film directed by Steno.[1][2] The character of Totò took inspiration from a similar character he played in Totò Diabolicus.[3]


Plot[edit]
The story is of Italian and British troops facing off on the Greek-Albanian border in 1943.  Both sides take, lose, and retake a border village countless times during the entire movie.  The village is taken and retaken by both sides so many times that the locals don't even pay attention to the battles any more and openly collaborate with whichever side is occupying the village at that time.  Both sides use the same hotel as their HQ and a friendship and mutual respect even develops between the two opposing commanding officers.  This goes on until the Germans arrive and order the Italian commander to destroy the village killing its inhabitants, an order the Italian commander refuses to carry out bringing on a death sentence.  His men refuse the German officer's order to fire and are also condemned to death.  The British recapture the village just in time to save the Italians, all rejoice at the news that Italy has just asked for an armistice.

Touch is the second studio album by Australian rock band Noiseworks. It was released by CBS Records on 14 November 1988.[1]
The album debuted at No. 5 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart.[7] The album was produced by Chris Kimsey (The Rolling Stones) and Noiseworks.[8] The title track preceded it as the first single, peaking at No. 12 on the ARIA Singles Chart.[7] Subsequent singles "Voice of Reason", "Simple Man" and "In My Youth" failed to make the Top 40 (despite the latter receiving considerable radio airplay). Nevertheless, Noiseworks became at the time one of Australia's most popular live rock acts.[9]

In this Chinese name, the family name is  Yu.
Beautiful Lady Yu (Chinese: 虞美人; died 179[1];personal name unknown) held the rank of "beautiful lady" (美人) in the harem of Emperor Shun of Han. She was the biological mother of Liu Sheng (刘生), Grand Princess of Wuyang (舞阳长公主) and Liu Bing, Emperor Chong of Han (汉冲帝刘炳).
Lady Yu was chosen to be a concubine at the age of 13 (by East Asian reckoning), on the basis of belonging to a "good family", and her mother's clan members were all honoured and favoured people. Later on she gave birth to her daughter, Liu Sheng. In 138, her daughter Liu Sheng was conferred the title "Grand Princess of Wuyang".
In 143, Lady Yu gave birth to Emperor Shun's only son: Liu Bing. In September 144, following the death of Emperor Shun, Liu Bing became emperor. In February of the following year, Liu Bing died.
When an Emperor ascended the throne, the mother of that Emperor would usually receive an honourable title. Yet, this was not the case for Beautiful Lady Yu. According to Book of the Later Han, due to General Liang Ji's violent seizure of power, Lady Yu's clan feared Liang Ji doing them harm and avoided court positions and honours, and was thus considered simply a "grand family".[2]
On 24 November 175,[3] Emperor Ling of Han honoured Lady Yu as mother of Emperor Chong by bestowing her the higher harem rank "noble lady of Xian hill" (宪园贵人), together with bestowing the title "concubine of Prince Xiao of Bohai" on Lady Chen, mother of Emperor Zhi of Han. Following this, Lady Yu was also known as "Noble Lady Yu of Xianling" (宪陵贵人虞氏). In 179,[4] Lady Yu died, having outlived both her husband and son by more than 30 years.

Footnotes[edit]


^ According to her biography in Book of the Later Han, Lady Yu was older than 13 years (by East Asian reckoning) in 138 when her daughter Liu Sheng was given her princess title. Thus, her birth year must be before 126. At the same time, she was likely to have joined her husband’s harem after his ascension in Dec 125, as her husband was 10 at the time and (probably more importantly) had lost his position as crown prince. Thus, Lady Yu’s birth year should be between 113 and 126.

^ dingsi day of the 10th month of the 4th year of the Xi’ping era, per Emperor Ling's biography in Book of the Later Han

Wish Kid is an animated television series that aired on Saturday mornings from September 14, 1991, through December 7, 1991 on NBC starring Macaulay Culkin.[1] It was produced by DIC Animation City and Italian company Reteitalia S.p.A., in association with Spanish network Telecinco.
A second season was planned for 1993 to air on The Family Channel, but this was later cancelled.[2][3]


Synopsis[edit]
Nicholas "Nick" McClary (modeled after and voiced by Culkin) owned a baseball glove that had been struck by a miniature shooting star, an event that inexplicably enabled it to magically grant wishes, if punched three times. It was, however, limited to use only once every week, and each wish would expire relatively shortly after it was cast, often at the most inopportune time possible.  Each story — introduced in a live-action prologue by Culkin — revolved around Nick's wishes and the trouble that always seemed to follow. It was up to Nick and others involved to resolve the situation and make things right.
Darryl Singletary was Nick's best friend and the only one in on the secret; he always managed to get tangled up in Nick's adventures. Francis "Frankie" Dutweiler was the neighborhood bully who often antagonized Nick and Darryl. Other characters included Mel and Adrienne McClary, Nick's parents who were a reporter/photographer and real estate agent, respectively; Nick's younger sister, Katie (voiced by Quinn Culkin, Macaulay's real life sister), his pet dog, Slobber, and nosy neighbor, Mrs. Opal.

Home media[edit]
DIC Video, BMG Kidz and Buena Vista Home Video originally released single episode VHS releases of the series during the 1990s.
In October 2003, Sterling Entertainment released a VHS/DVD titled "Be Careful What You Wish For", containing 3 episodes (4 on the DVD). The DVD was re-released by NCircle Entertainment in February 2008.
In February 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released Wish Kid - The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1.[4] However, there were some problems with some of the episodes. Like in "Mom, Dad, You're Fired", the audio was cut at some point. The restorations were not all that good either.

Syndication[edit]
After the show's initial airing, the show's theme song, which parodied Chantilly Lace, was replaced with a recomposed instrumental version due to copyright issues.

Agent Pink is the code name for a powerful herbicide and defoliant used by the U.S. military in its herbicidal warfare program during the Vietnam War. The name comes from the pink stripe painted on the barrels to identify the contents. Largely inspired by the British use of herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency, it was one of the rainbow herbicides that included the more infamous Agent Orange. Agent Pink was only used during the early "testing" stages of the spraying program before 1964.
Agent Pink's only active ingredient was 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), one of the common phenoxy herbicides of the era. Agent Pink contained about 60%–40% of this active substance. Even prior to Operation Ranch Hand (1962–1971) it was known[1][2][3][4][5][6] that a dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD), is produced as a byproduct of the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, and was present in any of the herbicides that used it, but to greater proportion in the earlier Agents, such as Pink.[7]
A 2003 Nature paper by Stellman et al., which re-apprised the average TCDD content of Agent Orange from the 3 ppm that USAF had reported to a level of 13 ppm, also estimated that Agent Pink may have had 65.5 ppm of TCDD on average. The comparatively smaller amounts of Agent Pink and Agent Purple, with the spraying of 50,312 L (11,067 imp gal; 13,291 US gal) of Agent Pink is documented, but an additional 413,852 L (91,035 imp gal; 109,328 US gal) appear on procurement records, probably depositing a larger percentage of the total dioxin.[7]

Invictus Records was an American record label based in Detroit, Michigan. It was created by former top Motown producers Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Edward Holland, Jr. (known collectively as Holland–Dozier–Holland).[1]  It was the sister label to the Buddah-distributed Hot Wax Records, which was also owned by Holland-Dozier-Holland.


History[edit]
For most of the 1960s until 1967, Holland-Dozier-Holland (H-D-H) were a leading songwriting and production team, providing hits for The Supremes, The Four Tops and other Motown acts. However, they decided to quit the company, they had helped to establish and start their own label for better control and greater rewards.  They eventually launched Invictus, along with Hot Wax Records, in 1969. Their most successful acts on Invictus were Freda Payne and Chairmen of the Board; they also released Parliament's first album, Osmium.[2]  The label was distributed by Capitol Records from 1969 to 1972 and then by Columbia Records from 1973 onwards.
In September 1970, the British music magazine NME reported that Invictus had the UK's top two singles. Freda Payne's "Band of Gold" was #1, while Chairmen of the Board's "Give Me Just a Little More Time" was at #3 in the UK Singles Chart.[1]  Both of those records were million-sellers in the US, but neither topped the pop or R&B charts. Invictus had two other gold records: Freda Payne's "Bring The Boys Home" and 8th Day's "She's Not Just Another Woman", both in 1971.
On leaving Motown, H-D-H were subject to legal action by Berry Gordy and, as a result, they were temporarily barred from issuing new compositions on their labels. Consequently, the names Holland-Dozier-Holland were not used until after 1970; releases were initially credited to Ronald Dunbar (one of their producers) and "Edyth Wayne", which was a pseudonym.
The Invictus label was light blue with black printing. A statue of a seated man (Auguste Rodin's "The Thinker") almost covers the entire label, with "INVICTUS" in dark blue at the top and to the left of the center hole. There are a group of black and white rays coming from the eye of the statue and extending downward to the right.
The trio launched a third label, Music Merchant, through Buddah Records in 1972 and signings included Michael Lovesmith and his brothers who recorded as The Smith Connection, former Motowner Brenda Holloway, The Jones Girls and Eloise Laws, but the only commercial success the label had was with The Smith Connection single "(I've Been a Winner, I've Been a Loser) I've Been in Love", which peaked at number 28 R&B in early 1973. Despite recording over a dozen releases, the label was closed the following year.
In 1973, when Hot Wax folded due to cash flow problems from royalty payment issues, Dozier left to forge a solo career and the Holland brothers moved their remaining artists to Invictus. The label continued to operate on a reduced level until 1977, when it also folded and was eventually remodeled to HDH Records.
Dozier and the Holland brothers still own the catalogue, which is managed by HDH Records.

The first USS Morris was a sailing ship in the Continental Navy in commission from 1778 to 1779. She was named for Founding Father, Continental Congressman, and a major financier of the American Revolution, Robert Morris.
During the American Revolutionary War a party twenty-nine men of the 13th Virginia Regiment led by James Willing departed Fort Pitt and traveled down the Mississippi river where they captured the British ship Rebecca moored at Fort Bute. Oliver Pollock, the American commercial agent at New Orleans who had charge of naval affairs on the Mississippi during the American Revolution, purchased Rebecca for the Continental Congress.[1] The ship was renamed Morris and was manned and converted to a Man-of-war under the command of Captain William Pickles.[2]
A severe hurricane destroyed Morris on 18 August 1779, causing the loss of 11 of her crew.[3]

Torrens Bridge railway station was a short-lived railway station on the Outer Harbor line in North Adelaide. The location of the station was east of Bonython Park. It was located about 1.7 kilometres (1.1 mi) from Adelaide station.
The station was opened in 1883 as the result of a petition from a pressure group on behalf of residents of North Adelaide. Facilities consisted of two side platforms, buildings on both platforms and a footbridge between them. As its name suggests, the station was located just west of the railway bridge that crossed the River Torrens. Before the station closed, it was the closest station to Adelaide station, but Mile End is now the closest.
The station was closed in 1888 and demolished shortly after. It was the first railway station to close in South Australia. The buildings and footbridge were relocated to the newly opened Croydon station. No trace remains of where the station was located, but the pedestrian crossing close to where the North and Port Lines part way is close to the location of the station.

Henry Slater (23 February 1855 – 20 November 1916) was an English cricketer who played for Derbyshire between 1882 and 1887.
Slater was born at Heanor, Derbyshire the son of  James Slater and his wife Elizabeth Baimbridge.[1] He became a coal miner.[2]
He made his cricket debut for Derbyshire in the 1882 season in June against Lancashire in which he took a wicket but scored no runs. His next game was against Nottinghamshire in the 1885 season when again he took a wicket. In the 1886 season he played against MCC and took two catches. He played two first-class games in the 1887 season and took a wicket against Lancashire. He also played two non-status matches that season in one of which he scored 54, a contrast to the low single figures he managed in most of his games Slater was a right-hand batsman and played 9 innings in five first-class matches with a top score of 21 and an average of 5.57. He was a right-arm medium pace bowler and took 3 wickets with an average of 61.66.[3]
Slater  married Sarah Ann Bestwick on 28 December 1878. Their sons Herbert Slater and Archibald Slater both played for Derbyshire. Slater died at Worksop, Nottinghamshire at the age of 61.

Hollow Run is a tributary of Cooks Creek which is located in Durham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania in the United States.


Statistics[edit]
Hollow Run was entered into the Geographic Names Information System of the U.S. Geological Survey on 30 August 1990 as identification number 1196191. It is contained wholly within Durham Township.
It rises at an elevation of 618 feet (188 m) and meets its confluence with Cooks Creek at an elevation of 203 feet (62 m). The length of the stream is 2.18 miles (3.51 km), and has an average slope of 190 feet per mile (35.9 meters per kilometer).[1]

Course[edit]
Hollow Run rises on the eastern slope of Buckwampum Hill oriented north for a short distance. It then turns to the northeast then curves back around to the north. At river mile 1.43 it receives a tributary from the left and abruptly turns again to the northeast.
At river mile 1.25 it passes through a pond or dammed reservoir. Shortly after it leaves the pond, it picks up a tributary from the right at river mile 1.05, then flows generally north to its confluence at Cooks Creek's 2.42 river mile.[2]

Geology[edit]
Buckwampum Hill is part of the Quartz Fanglomerate formation, from the Jurassic and Triassic, which is a coarse conglomerate of rounded cobbles and boulders. Mineralogy consists of quartzite, sandstone, quartz, and metarhyolite in red sand.
As Hollow Run flows northward, it then runs into a Hornblende and Gneiss formation, from the Precambrian, which also consists of labradorite.
As it approaches Cooks Creek it flows into the Hardyston Formation, from the Cambrian period, consisting of quartzite and feldpathic sandstone and has some quartz pebble conglomerate and is somewhat porous and limonitic.[3]

The Toronto Raptors 2006–07 season was the twelfth National Basketball Association (NBA) season for the Toronto Raptors basketball franchise. Following a poor 2005–06 season, General Manager Bryan Colangelo greatly revamped the team roster during the pre-season but continued to build the team around All-Star Chris Bosh. Despite a sluggish start, the 2006–07 season transformed into a watershed year for Toronto. The Raptors captured their first division title, finished third in the Eastern Conference, made the playoffs for the first time in five years, equalled their best ever regular season record (47–35) of the 2000–01 team (a franchise record eventually surpassed by the 2014–15 team that won 49 games and the 2017–18 team that won 59 games), and secured home court advantage for the first time in franchise history. However, the Raptors met the New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated four games to two. At the end of the regular season, head coach Sam Mitchell and Colangelo were named NBA Coach of the Year and NBA Executive of the Year respectively. The Raptors also changed their colour scheme which is still in use today.


Pre-season[edit]

The Raptors used an alternate logo for the 2006–07 NBA season, seen here in the centre of the court.
Toronto's 2006–07 roster featured many players who have played in Europe.
The Raptors signed two-time Euroleague MVP Anthony Parker, who became one of the NBA's top three-point shooters and perimeter defenders.
The 2006–07 season saw a reduction in minutes for Raptors veteran Morris Peterson (right), but also an introduction of Spanish veteran Jorge Garbajosa (left) to the starting lineup.

2006 NBA Draft

Pre-season trades[edit]
Before the season, Toronto won the NBA draft lottery and were awarded the 1st overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft. To prepare for their draft choice, the Raptors traded Rafael Araújo for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley,[1] and traded Matt Bonner, Eric Williams and a second round pick for Rasho Nesterovič and cash considerations.[2] The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian Andrea Bargnani, making him the first European drafted number one overall.[3] Maurizio Gherardini was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager, making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job.[4] Promising small forward Charlie Villanueva was traded for point guard T. J. Ford and cash considerations,[5] while Chris Bosh was rewarded with a three-year extension.[6]

Regular season[edit]
General Manager Bryan Colangelo continued to surround Bosh with complementary players, and signed two-time Euroleague Most Valuable Player Anthony Parker.[7] Spanish international Jorge Garbajosa and former slam dunk champion Fred Jones were also signed from free agency. The Raptors concluded pre-season transactions by re-signing veteran Darrick Martin. With this new lineup, Toronto looked to maintain a team who could both pass and shoot the ball, but was also stronger defensively than the 2005–06 roster.[8] As a showcase of their new roster, on 15 October 2006, the 119 points by Toronto marked the third highest total in a pre-season game in franchise history.[9] The Raptors finished the pre-season with a 7–1 win–loss record, which was the best record in the league and a franchise record.[10]

Push for playoffs[edit]
The first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark after a dismal 2–8 start.[8] Bosh's consistent performances however ensured he was named an All-Star starter in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game on 25 January 2007. He received the most votes after LeBron James among all Eastern Conference forwards.[11] A day later, the Raptors hit the .500 mark for the first time since the 2003–04 season after defeating the Boston Celtics at the Air Canada Centre.[12] On 2 February, the Raptors went 24–23, the first time since 2001–02 that they had been over .500 this late in a season.[13] As a result, the Raptors won three NBA Eastern Conference awards for the month of January: Player of the Month (Bosh),[14] Rookie of the Month (Bargnani)[15] and Coach of the Month (Sam Mitchell).[16] On 4 February, the Raptors' 122–110 home win against the Los Angeles Clippers represented a season-high in points for the Raptors.[17] Within the same week, Bosh's career-high 41 points in a win against the Orlando Magic prompted an unheard of event at the Air Canada Centre—chants of "MVP" by the home fans.[18] This chant was repeated in a win against Vince Carter's New Jersey Nets ten days later—to the disbelief of Carter—a game which also saw the team break franchise records for the most home wins and highest home winning percentage entering the All-Star break.[19][20]
After the break, Colangelo traded Jones for Juan Dixon, a versatile guard.[21] Luke Jackson was also signed to provide depth to Toronto's bench.[22] Following a win against the Charlotte Bobcats on 1 April 2007, Toronto clinched a playoff berth for the first time in five years.[23] They then claimed their first division title when they defeated the Philadelphia 76ers five days later, winning the Atlantic Division crown.[24] Another franchise record was set when Toronto won the next game against the Bulls, this time for most home wins.[25]
The Raptors were eventually seeded third in the Eastern Conference, marking one of the biggest turnarounds in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking.[26] Throughout the season, they were lauded for playing solid defense and good sharing and moving of the ball.[8][27] José Calderón, Bargnani, Dixon and Morris Peterson turned in reliable performances from the bench while Ford and Bosh ran the offence with consistent numbers.[8] And in Parker and Garbajosa, the Raptors had two very versatile players who could both defend and attack.[28][29][30] Furthermore, in contrast to previous seasons, the Raptors were able to win games despite injuries to key players such as Bosh, Bargnani, Parker, Ford and Garbajosa.[31][32] Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were also largely credited for transforming Toronto's fortunes.[33]

Playoffs[edit]
As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media attention as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net.[34] In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter.[34] A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.[35] The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5.[36] In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half.[37] The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game.[38] In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.[39]
In recognition of being the chief architects of Toronto's turnaround season, on 24 April 2007, Mitchell was named 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year, the first Raptors coach to receive this honour;[40] Colangelo was later named 2006–07 Executive of the Year.[41]

Motol (Belarusian: Моталь, Russian and West Polesian: Мотоль, Polish: Motol, Yiddish: מאָטעלע Motele), also Motal, is a township in Ivanava Raion of Brest Region located about 30 kilometres west of Pinsk on the Yaselda River in Belarus.


History[edit]
Founded as a royal city of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1554 by  Queen Bona Sforza. A part of the Pinsk ‘ekonomia’ or royal land, in the late 18th century it was also part of the Pińsk powiat of the Brest Litovsk Voivodeship.
After the Partitions of Poland, Motal became part of the Russian Empire. It was in the Kobrinsky Uyezd of Grodno Governorate until the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917. Between World War I and World War II it was in the Drohiczyn powiat of the Polish Polesie Voivodeship. It is near the center of Polesia which constituted an irregular rectangle of roughly 180 kilometres (110 mi) from east to west and 80 km (50 mi) from north to south.[citation needed]
Motal was a Shtetl. In 1937, Motal had 4,297 inhabitants, of whom 1,354 were Jews. (Reinharz, 1985). 
During the war an Einsatzgruppen perpetrated a mass execution of the local Jewish community.[1]
The Destruction of Motele (Hurban Motele) was published in Hebrew by the Council of Motele Immigrants in Jerusalem in 1956. It was edited by A.L. Poliak, Ed. Dr. Dov Yarden.  The book has 87 pages and contains memoirs and events leading up to the destruction of the Jews of Motele in 1942.[2]
Anshe Motele Congregation, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, was founded in Chicago on Sept. 3, 1903, by 14 immigrants who named it after Motel.[3]

Economics[edit]
The largest company in Motol is Agromotol.[citation needed]

Education[edit]
Motol has 2 secondary schools and an art school.[citation needed]

Niederau station is a regional station on the Leipzig–Dresden railway in Niederau in the German state of Saxony. The railway station, which was opened on 15 May 1842, for a long time had the oldest operating station building in Germany,[3] but Deutsche Bahn stopped using it and sold it after 2000.


History[edit]
At the bottom of this section of a map, the straight road runs from Meissen to Niederau station
After the opening of the Leipzig-Dresden Railway on 7 April 1839, Oberau station was the closest station to Meissen, but the inconvenient location of the station high above a cutting on the approach to Oberau Tunnel, made access difficult and so Meissen sought easier access to the line. These efforts were successful: the new Niederau station was completed on 1 April 1842 after half a year of construction and the station was opened on 15  May 1842. Simultaneously, a new direct access road was built from Meissen to Niederau, now called Niederauer or Meissner Strasse.[4]
For a while the traffic brought by carriage from Meissen made the station competitive for trains to Leipzig or Dresden with the Coswig–Meißen branch line, which opened on 1 December 1860 and allowed direct rail journeys from Meissen to Dresden. A line was completed from Borsdorf to Meissen in December 1868, creating a direct rail link between Meissen and Leipzig. Thus Niederau station lost its importance and traffic fell sharply.[5]
Freight operations in Niederau were abandoned on 1 July 1964.[6]
In 1988, one year before the celebration of  the 150th anniversary of the first German long-distance railway between Leipzig and Dresden, the station was completely restored.[7] At that time, the station building was the oldest on the network of Deutsche Reichsbahn[8]
In the early 2000s, Deutsche Bahn sold the railway station building.[9] It is now used as a residence.
The modular building of an electronic interlocking (ESTW-A) has been located on the eastern side of the line to the south of the former station building since 2000. This is operated from the electronic control centre (ESTW-Z) in Priestewitz.

Regional services[edit]
The station is served by Regional-Express service RE 50, running between Leipzig and Dresden and Regionalbahn service RB 31, running between Elsterwerda-Biehla and Dresden (as of December 2014).

Infrastructure[edit]
The peculiar two-part main station building is a result of its construction and usage history. The larger part, lying on the left as seen from the tracks, was built as a Restaurationsgebäude (restaurant building), while the building on the right was built as the station building. Later, they were both rebuilt in the Swiss chalet style. The building complex is a heritage-listed building.

Entrance building (originally restaurant building)[edit]

Baroness von Werther, the owner of Oberau Castle, built the building and operated it at first as an inn. The half-timbered building was given a wood sheathing in 1862 and it was plastered with the appearance of Cyclopean masonry 15 years later. Also in 1877, the premises of the officials' apartments were renovated and a station restaurant was built in the new rooms.[4] Subsequently the building was used both for residential and station purposes. To emphasize the latter function, it received a station clock and the station sign that broke up the previously empty space on the building's gable during a reorganisation in 1988.[7]

Colm KiernanColm Kiernan in 1976.BornColm Padraic Kiernan(1931-11-24)24 November 1931London, EnglandDied27 March 2010(2010-03-27) (aged 78)Wollongong, AustraliaResting placeLakeside Memorial Park, KanahookaOccupationHistorian, writerEducationBA, MA (Melb)BA, MA (Cantab)PhD (UNSW)
Colm Padraic Kiernan (24 November 1931 – 27 March 2010) was an Australian historian and writer.


Historian[edit]
In 1964, Colm Kiernan was appointed foundation Lecturer in History at the University of Wollongong, Australia.[1] There began a long and successful career as an academic and researcher in both European and Australian history, which encompassed his writing of two volumes of Science and the Enlightenment of 18th Century France, the biographies of Arthur Calwell[2] and Archbishop Daniel Mannix, and his last book, Australia and Ireland – Bicentenary Essays 1788–1988.[3]

Irish background[edit]
Kiernan was the only son of Dr Thomas Joseph Kiernan, Irish diplomat and academic,[4][5][6] and the Irish ballad singer Delia Murphy.[7][8] He received a classical education at boarding school in Clongowes, Ireland, the school which James Joyce describes in his writing A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. During this time, his father was posted to be the Irish Ambassador to the Vatican[9] and his family was presented to the Pope. It was a grand occasion, and his parents and three sisters were photographed for the local newspapers. Kiernan used to say the only thing he remembered from that occasion was that he was allowed to play on the Pope's Golden Telephone. He was a strong believer in Catholicism, and having been educated by the Jesuits, he understood the Church laws and decrees. His faith was more an intellectual spiritual belief than a practical religiosity, but it was a very deep commitment from which he never wavered. He used to say that in boarding school he had attended enough Masses to last him the rest of his life.[10]

Poem[edit]
The Irish poet Daniel Kelleher wrote this poem for Colm Kiernan (CK) to mark his christening.[11] It was read at his funeral.[12]


For CK at his Christening

We wish to the new child,
A heart that can be beguiled,
By a flower,
That the wind lifts,
As it passes.
If the storms break for him,
May the trees shake for him,
Their blossoms down.

In the night that he is troubled,
May a friend wake for him,
So that his time be doubled,
And at the end of all loving and love
May the Man above,
Give him a crown.


When he was the Irish Ambassador to the United States, T. J. Kiernan recited this poem to the parents of John F. Kennedy, Jr. soon after he was born in 1960. It was recited again by Senator Ted Kennedy to mark the death of John Jr. in 1999.[13]

Irish Australian[edit]
When his father was appointed as the first Irish Ambassador to Australia, in 1946, Kiernan finished his schooling at St Patrick's College, Goulburn.[14] After completing his BA and MA at the University of Melbourne, he married Joan Louise McKay (1935–1992) on 24 August 1954, at St Christopher's Church in Manuka, A.C.T.  They traveled to Cambridge, England, where Kiernan converted his degrees to a BA, MA (Cantab). Their first child was born in Cambridge, their second in Dublin, Ireland, and the third in Wollongong. Kiernan was the first PhD completion in the Arts Faculty for the University of New South Wales, Kensington.[10]
While appointed Professor of Australian History at University College Dublin in Ireland, Kiernan researched the Irish background of many Australian political and historical figures including Henry Handel Richardson and Peter Lalor.[15] He was well versed in Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Latin, and old English and could translate many very difficult texts including those written by the Brontë sisters, also of Irish descent, particularly Charlotte, who wrote in a mixture of Gaelic and old English.[10]
He spoke fluent Italian, Spanish, and French, loved language, literature, and poetry, and was passionate about all things Irish Australian. He married Susan Margaret Mayer, his second wife, on 11 June 1994, and they had a son together. Kiernan is survived by Susan, his four children and nine grandchildren.[10]

Portrait of Mink with Violet ShawlArtistMax BeckmannYear1910MediumOil on canvasDimensions136.5 cm × 100.5 cm (53.7 in × 39.6 in)LocationSaint Louis Art Museum, Saint Louis
Portrait of Mink with Violet Shawl is an oil-on-canvas portrait by German painter Max Beckmann. It depicts his first wife, the opera singer Minna Beckmann-Tube, and was executed in 1910. It is held in the collection of the Saint Louis Art Museum.[1]

Description and analysis[edit]
The painting depicts Minna, also known as Mink, seated in a chair, wearing a black dress, with a violet shawl covering her shoulders and arms, her hands folded, while she looks quietly to her left. The background appears in a bluish colour.
The portrait was executed during the painter's twenties, when he was openly critical of the more modern contemporary art tendencies, such as expressionism, fauvism and cubism. Beckmann still follows German impressionism, reflecting the influence of Max Liebermann, in particular in his somber tonalities, but without his brushwork, or the brilliance of Lovis Corinth. His style is more conservative and still close to realism.[2]

Provenance[edit]
The painting was bequested by Morton D. May to the Saint Louis Art Museum in 1983.[3]

Alfred Edward Waterson (5 August 1880, Derby – 25 November 1964) was a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom. He was the first Co-operative Party MP.
Born in Derby, Waterson was a railwayman and activist in his trade union. He served as a town councillor.
Although the Co-operative Party put up several candidates for the first time at the 1918 general election, only one met with success. Waterson was elected as MP for the Kettering seat. He took the Labour whip in Parliament, ahead of any decision of Co-operative Congress to progress a formal alliance with the Labour Party.
Waterson was defeated at the 1922 general election.  He became a national organiser of the Co-operative Party, serving until 1945.  He contested the Nottingham Central by-election in 1930, and stood in Nottingham Central at the 1931 general election, coming a distant second in each case. He died in Wood Green, London aged 84.

Hong River is a major tributary river of Huai River system. Its source is on the western slope of Dengtaijia Peak near the border between the city of Wugang and Biyang County of Henan province. If flows for about 326 kilometres (203 mi) before meeting the Huai River near the provincial border between Henan and Anhui provinces. The lower section of Hong River is also called Hongru River (洪汝河), as it follows the lower course of a historical Ru River (汝水) that was artificially redirected during Yuan and Ming dynasties. Suya Lake on Hong River is the largest reservoir on the plain in China.

Al-Masmiyah (Arabic: المسمية, also spelled Musmiyeh, Mesmiyeh, Mismiya, Mismia and Musmeih) is a town in southern Syria, administratively part of the Daraa Governorate, located northeast of Daraa in the al-Sanamayn District. Nearby localities include Jabab and Muthabin to the west, Ghabaghib to the northeast, Jubb al-Safa to the north, Burraq to the northeast, Khalkhalah and al-Surah al-Saghirah to the southeast  and Dama to the south.[2]


History[edit]
The ancient city of Phaena, judging by the ruin field still visible at Masmiya in the 19th century, had a radius of roughly three miles, making it as large as the ancient walled area of Damascus and larger than the Old City of Jerusalem[3] (which is of Early Muslim date in its present outline and smaller than some of its earlier iterations).

Roman period[edit]
Al-Masmiyah is identified with the Roman-era town of Phaena.[4] Phaena was the capital of the Trachonitis district of Roman Syria, as confirmed by a Greek inscription on the Roman temple which reads "Julius Saturninus to the people of Phaena, capital of Trachon."[5] The ruins of a Roman era house built in the Batanean architectural style is believed to have possibly served as the home of the Roman governor of Trachonitis.[6] One of the rooms on the ground-level floor was supported by an 18-foot arch and had a cornice-decorated ceiling. The town contains the ruins of a Roman-era pagan temple, called the Praetorium,[7][8] that was constructed by the commander of the Third Gallic Legion between 160–169 CE during the reign of the Roman emperors Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Verus.[5]
In the early 3rd century CE, Phaena was still an important village known as a metrocomia.[9]

Byzantine periods[edit]
The Praetorium was transformed into a church during the Byzantine period and the structural plan makes it one of the oldest examples of Byzantine church architecture.[clarification needed][10] During the Byzantine period it became an episcopal see, whose bishops participated in the ecumenical councils of Ephesus (431) and 
Chalcedon (451).[4][5]

Ottoman period[edit]
19th century[edit]
In 1810, Swiss explorer Johann Burckhardt was the first contemporary scholar to visit al-Masmiyah and he was later followed by Bankes and Barry, who sketched a precise plan of the Praetorium, in 1819.[11] In 1838, Biblical scholar Eli Smith reported that Kurds inhabited the village.[12]  By the late 1860s a few impoverished Arab families from the Sulut tribe reportedly lived inside the ruins of al-Masmiyah.[13] Apparently, the village was abandoned most of the time, but was occasionally occupied by nomadic Arab families seeking shelter in its ruins.[3]
In the 1870s, al-Masmiyah was an uninhabited village.[4] However, it was later settled when the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II (1876–1909) acquired al-Masmiyah and six other nearby Hauran villages in the late 19th century as a personal estate. The farmers he employed in the village were afforded security, giving them protection from nomadic raiders. They were also exempt from conscription, protected from monetary collections from local notables and at times were loaned money without interest. These factors resulted in the prosperity of al-Masmiyah and the larger estate.[14]
In 1875, before Abdul Hamid's reign, the Ottoman army took apart the Praetorium for the construction material used to build a nearby army barracks at Burraq.[11]
In 1886, al-Masmiyah was briefly occupied by the Druze clans of Atrash and Halabi during a quarrel with the Sulut tribe.[15]

20th century[edit]
Following the Young Turk Revolution in 1908, the sultan ceded estate to the treasury department of the Damascus government and consequently, the inhabitants, who were both tenants of the government and permanent residents of the villages, had to pay 20–22% of their agricultural products to the authorities. Nonetheless, the conditions of the inhabitants of the government estate were better than the estates of the notables.[14] In 1915 the population of al-Masmiyah was estimated as 300 Melkites (Greek Catholics) and 20 Sunni Muslims.

Archaeological remains[edit]
According to Western traveler Josias Leslie Porter who visited the region in the late 1850s, the ruins of al-Masmiyah "are among the most interesting and beautiful in the Hauran," not least due to its numerous Greek inscriptions.[3] The majority of the ancient city's homes were in rubble, but a number of public buildings were relatively well-preserved.[3] Porter further remarked that except for the Roman temple "there are several other buildings ... but they are not remarkable either for their size or architecture.[5]

Roman temple[edit]
The temple was destroyed in 1875 or 76 by the Ottoman army, who used its stones to build a barracks at Burraq. The temple had earlier been photographed by Tancrède Dumas.[11] It still remained the subject of study by scholars in Greco-Roman architecture after its dismantlement.
This is a description based on traveler reports predating the 1875 destruction.
Along with the Roman temple dedicated to Tyche in nearby al-Sanamayn, the so-called "Praetorium" of al-Masmiyah is the only Roman temple in the Levant that contains niches for statues in the cella. This unique feature in Roman architecture was likely inspired by pre-Roman architecture, particularly the temple of Baal-Shamin in the Syrian Desert town of Palmyra or in various Arabian cities.[16] The Praetorium was situated atop a podium in a temenos surrounded by colonnades.[11]
It was relatively small, measuring 24.8 x 16.4 meters.[11] It has a rectangular ground plan with a semi-circular apse that projects onto one side of the building opposite of the doorway.[17] Both sides of the doorway contained niches reserved for statues.[18] The interior space consisted of a single room, which was the naos,[11] and measured 15.09 x 13.78 meters.[19]
The Praetorium was formerly topped by a square domed roof, likely a cloister vault, which had since collapsed.[17][18] The roof is supported by four free-standing columns fixed at the inner angles of cross-vaulted arches,[7] which together form a Greek cross.[10] On the opposite end of each columns stood a half-column, making for a total of four main columns, eight half-columns, and four quarter columns (situated at each corner) inside the naos.[19] The arches sit on lintels that span the space between the outer wall and the columns supporting the roof.[7]
There were six niches against the walls that were reserved for the placement of statues and in the center of them was the main space, the adyton, used to hold the main statue of the pagan cult. The adyton was topped by a conch-shaped half-dome.[20] The building had two windows, a rare feature in Classical pagan temples, and a total of three entryways.[19] Of the entryways, there was a principal central doorway that was higher and broader than the two side-doors.[21]
The temple ruins contained a partially destroyed portico with six columns.[10] The material used for the building was dry stone.[17] Other than the dome and the portico, the building had been well preserved until the 19th century.[18]

Demographics[edit]
According to the Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Masmiyah had a population of 1,498 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the al-Masmiyah nahiyah ("subdistrict") which consists of 16 localities with a collective population of 8,773 in 2004.[22] As of the early 20th century, its inhabitants were largely Melkite Christians, though there was a small Muslim community as well. In 2004, the village still had a significant Melkite Christian population.[23]

Daniele Capelli (born 20 June 1986) is an Italian former footballer who played as a defender.

Career[edit]
Deemed surplus to requirements prior to the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Capelli was loaned to Serie B side Reggina. However, by January 2010, Atalanta were struggling near the bottom of the table and Capelli was promptly recalled.[1] In July 2011 Capelli signed a new four-year contract.[2]
On 28 August 2013, Capelli was signed by A.C. Cesena in a temporary deal.[3] On 27 June 2014, the loan was extended.[4]
On 30 June 2015, Capelli became a free agent. On 10 July 2015 Capelli signed a two-year contract with Cesena.[5]
On 2 July 2018, he signed a two-year contract with Serie B club Padova.[6]

Leslie John Huckfield (born 7 April 1942)[1] is a British Labour politician who served as member of parliament (MP) for Nuneaton from 1967 to 1983 and as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1984 to 1989.


Early life[edit]
He attended Prince Henry's Grammar School in Evesham, where he won a sixth form prize,[2]
taking his A-levels in 1959.[3] In 1960 he was given a Trevelyan Scholarship.[4][5]
From 1960 to 1963, Huckfield studied at Keble College, Oxford, graduating with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, subsequently promoted to MA.
From 1963 to 1966, he worked as a lecturer in economics at Birmingham City University (then the City of Birmingham College of Commerce) whilst studying for a Master of Commerce degree, specialising in Econometrics and Statistics.[citation needed]

Parliamentary career[edit]
Huckfield first stood for Parliament at Warwick and Leamington in 1966, but he was defeated by the Conservative incumbent John Hobson.
In 1967, at the age of 24, Huckfield was elected to parliament for the constituency of Nuneaton in a by-election following the resignation of Frank Cousins, becoming the youngest MP (the "Baby of the House").  He was Under-Secretary of State for Industry from 1976 to 1979, serving under Industry Secretary Eric Varley in the government of James Callaghan. For a time he was a member of Labour's National Executive Committee, holding the Socialist Societies seat.   When Labour returned to opposition in 1979, he was opposition spokesperson on industry from 1979 to 1981. He was a founding member of the Socialist Campaign Group in 1982.
After being re-elected in four general elections, Huckfield did not stand when the constituency boundaries were changed for the 1983 general election. The Nuneaton seat was gained by the Conservative Lewis Stevens, who held it until 1992. Huckfield had been expected to contest the recreated Sedgefield seat for the 1983 general election, but instead Labour selected Tony Blair as their candidate, who was elected.[6]

Huckfield was then appointed as Director of the Capital Transport Campaign for the Greater London Council. In the 1984 elections for the European Parliament, he was returned as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Merseyside East constituency.  He was Vice Chair of Parliament's Transport Committee, and stood down in 1989.
He is now based in Auchterarder, Scotland, where he runs a funding consultancy called Leslie Huckfield Research International. He quit as a Labour member in 2003 and now supports Scottish independence.[7][8]

Disney Interactive is an American video game and internet company that oversees various websites and interactive media owned by The Walt Disney Company.[1]


History[edit]
1995–1996: Formation and beginnings[edit]
In December 1994, Disney announced that it was establishing a new division dedicated to publishing computer and video game console software, called Disney Interactive.[5] The initial staff consisted of 200 newly hired employees.[5] The company was formally established in mid-1995.[6] On August 23, 1995, Disney Interactive formed Disney Online.[7]

In August 1996, BVIG took a controlling in interest in toysmart.com with three directors on the board. Toysmart would be granted marketing support including free advertising on BVIG websites like family.com.[15] After an attempted round of financing, Toysmart.com shut down in May 2000.[16]
In June 1999, the Disney Internet Guide is abandoned.[17] The Go.com portal was shut down in 2001 at a cost of $878 million in charges.[18]
In 2004, Disney re-activated the Starwave identity as Starwave Mobile, which publishes casual games for mobile phones for non-Disney brands with in Disney conglomerate or from third party.[19] In December 2004 and partnered with Indiagames, the Walt Disney Internet Group released Disney games, wallpapers and ringtones in the Indian market which is also available on AirTel.[20]
The group further expanded through purchase of Living Mobile, a European mobile game developer and publisher in November 2005[21] and Enorbus Technologies in 2007.[22]

2008–2012: Disney Interactive Media Group[edit]
On June 5, 2008, Disney Interactive Studios and the Walt Disney Internet Group merged into a single business unit, now known as the Disney Interactive Media Group.[23] In 2009, DIMG's Disney Online unit purchased multiple websites from Kaboose.[24]
In July 2010, Disney Interactive purchased Playdom for $563.2 million[25] and Tapulous for its Mobile division.[3] On July 1, Disney Interactive announced it had acquired Tapulous, the studio behind the Tap Tap Revenge franchise for iOS.[26] In October, two co-presidents were named for DIMG, John Pleasants and James Pitaro, with orders to make the company profitable.[27]
In January 2011, DIMG closed its Propaganda Games game studio and laid off 200 employees later in the month. The dual presidents placed the game studios of Blackrock, Junction Point, Avalanche, Wideload and Gamestar under its new game development chief Alex Seropian while Penguin creator Lane Merrifield was assigned to game initiatives for kids and families within a new publishing unit to handle marketing and production.[27] On February 18, DIMG purchased Togetherville, a pre-teen social network.[28] Also in February, Disney purchased Finland-based Rocket Pack, a game development company with a plugin free game development system.[29] In November, DIMG purchased Babble Media Inc.[30]

DIMG also in October announced "Toy Box", a cross platform gaming initiative where Pixar and Disney characters will interact from a console game to multiple mobile and online applications.[18]

2012–2018: Disney Interactive[edit]
Around May–July 2012, Disney Interactive Media Group changed its name to Disney Interactive (DI).[32]
In January 2013, Disney Interactive Games' Avalanche Software unveiled the Toy Box cross platform game as Disney Infinity, based on Toy Story 3: The Video Game's "Toy Box" mode crossed with a toy line.[33] Also in January, Disney Interactive announced the closure of Junction Point Studios.[34]
In October 2013, Disney announced that its Interactive division had a profit of $16 million for its fourth quarter, based partly on sales of Disney Infinity and uniting both halves of the division under one president.[35]
In March 2014, Disney Interactive announced it was laying off 700 people, or one-fourth of its staff as DI combines its two-game units, mobile and social, due to sagging popularity of Facebook games, and closing some Disney Online sites. They said will focus less on advertising and more on sponsorships for Disney Online and licensed game development. While some endeavors have shown profitability, such as an app in Japan and the combined game and toy line Infinity, the segment as a whole is unprofitable for Disney.[4]
Disney Interactive was merged with Disney Consumer Products on June 29, 2015, forming a new segment and division known as "Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media", with Disney Interactive as a direct unit.[36] In December 2015, Maker Studios was placed under the control of Disney Interactive with the appointment of Maker's executive vice president Courtney Holt, reporting to Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive.[37]
With a lack of growth in toy-to-game market and increasing developmental costs, in May 2016, Disney Interactive discontinued Disney Infinity and closed down the unit that developed Infinity, Avalanche Software. Also, the company ended all self-publishing efforts. A discontinuation charge of $147 million for ending its console gaming business affected earning.[38]
In September 2018, Disney confirmed the imminent discontinuation of Club Penguin Island in a letter sent to its Disney Online Studios team in Kelowna, as well as the layoffs of most employees in said studio.[39]
In November 2018, Disney agreed to have Jam City take over operation of its Glendale-based Disney Interactive Studios, sell them Emoji Blitz and development of future Pixar and Walt Disney Animation franchises games. Staff at the studio would be offered jobs with Jam City working on the Disney titles.[40]

Randy Steven Kraft (born March 19, 1945) is an American serial killer and rapist known as the Scorecard Killer, the Southern California Strangler, and the Freeway Killer,[4] who committed the rape, torture, and murder of a minimum of sixteen young men between 1972 and 1983, the majority of whom he killed in California. Kraft is also believed to have committed the rape and murder of up to fifty-one other young men and boys. He was convicted in May 1989[5] and is currently incarcerated on death row at San Quentin State Prison in Marin County, California.[6]
Kraft became known as the "Scorecard Killer" because upon his arrest, investigators discovered a coded list with sixty-one entries on a scorecard containing cryptic references to his victims;[7] he is also sometimes referred to as the "Freeway Killer" because many of his victims' bodies were discovered beside or near freeways.[8]


Early life[edit]
Childhood[edit]
Randy Steven Kraft was born in Long Beach, California, on March 19, 1945, the fourth child and only son of Opal Lee (née Beal) and Harold Herbert Kraft.[9] Kraft's father had moved to California from Wyoming weeks after the American entry into World War II;[10] upon finding employment as a production operative at Douglas Aircraft Company, he was joined by his wife and three daughters.[9]
The Kraft family lived modestly, and Kraft's mother took several jobs to supplement her husband's assembly-line salary. Kraft's mother initially found employment as a seamstress in a Westminster garment factory before later obtaining employment as a cook in a local school.[11]  Nonetheless, Opal Kraft always found time for her children; in contrast, Kraft's father seldom attended any social gatherings with them and was later described as being "distanced" from his family.[12] As a child, Kraft was doted on by his three older sisters and mother,[12] although he was known to be accident-prone.[9]
In 1948, the Kraft family moved from Long Beach to Midway City in neighboring Orange County.[13] Their home was a small, wood-frame Women's Army Corps dormitory on Beach Boulevard that Kraft's father renovated into a three-bedroom house. The family became active in the Westminster First Presbyterian Church, with Kraft's mother rising to the chairman of the deacons committee.[14]
In Midway City, Kraft attended Midway City Elementary school, where his mother was a member of the PTA. As a student, his intelligence was noted by classmates and teachers. By 1957, Kraft was judged intelligent enough to attend accelerated classes at 17th Street Junior High School.[14]

Adolescence and graduation[edit]
By adolescence, Kraft had taken a keen interest in politics, becoming a staunch Republican[15] and aspiring to become a U.S. senator. Shortly after his enrollment at Westminster High School, he and two close friends founded the Westminster World Affairs Club. At Westminster High, Kraft was again regarded as a pleasant, bright student who regularly achieved A grades.[16] He was also known to occasionally date girls,[17] although some classmates and teachers later stated that they suspected Kraft was homosexual.[18]
Kraft later stated he had known from his high school days that he was homosexual, although he initially kept his sexual orientation a secret. On June 13, 1963, he graduated tenth in his class of 390 students.[17] That fall, he enrolled at Claremont Men's College[19] in Claremont, California, where he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[20]

Claremont Men's College[edit]
Shortly after his enrollment at Claremont, Kraft enrolled in the Reserve Officers Training Corps[20] and regularly attended demonstrations in support of the Vietnam War and—in 1964—campaign rallies for Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater. He later declared these actions were merely a simulation of his parents' political views and not his own, describing his second year at Claremont as being when he abandoned the "last gasp" of his conservative ideology.[20] The same year, Kraft entered his first known homosexual relationship.[21]
In 1964, Kraft began working as a bartender at a local Garden Grove cocktail lounge that catered to gay clientele; he was also known to regularly travel to Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach to have casual sex with hustlers. In an apparent tentative effort to reveal his sexual orientation to his parents, Kraft took a succession of male "friends" to meet his family during his years at Claremont. Initially, Kraft's parents and sisters were oblivious to his homosexuality.[20]
In 1966, Kraft was arrested and charged with lewd conduct after propositioning an undercover police officer in Huntington Beach;[22] as he had no previous criminal record, no charges were filed. The following year, he developed a radical shift in his political beliefs, becoming an ardent supporter of liberal views and eventually registered as a Democrat in 1967.[23] Kraft quickly became a Democratic Party organizer, campaigning tirelessly for the election of Robert F. Kennedy and receiving a personal letter from the senator thanking him for his efforts.
By his senior year, Kraft had become a lackadaisical student, drinking, taking drugs, and regularly attending all-night gambling and poker sessions with other students.[24] The lack of commitment to his studies in his final year resulted in Kraft's failing to graduate from Claremont in June 1967 and being forced to repeat his econometrics class, which postponed his graduation by eight months. In February 1968, Kraft graduated from Claremont Men's College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics.[23]

U.S. Air Force[edit]
Four months after graduating from college, Kraft joined the United States Air Force. He was sent to basic training in Texas before being stationed at Edwards Air Force Base in southern California, where he supervised the painting of test planes.[19] During his service in the Air Force, Kraft rose to the rank of Airman First Class and supervisor-manager.[23]
The same year that Kraft became an Airman First Class, he disclosed to his family that he was homosexual. In a letter he wrote to a friend, Kraft described his father as having flown "into a rage," whereas he described his mother as being more understanding, if somewhat disapproving.[19] Kraft's family ultimately accepted his sexuality, and he remained in close contact with his parents and siblings, although his siblings noted he began to "distance himself" from his family after he had disclosed his sexuality to them.[25]
On July 26, 1969, Kraft announced his sexual orientation to his superiors. He was then granted a general discharge after only 13 months of service. His dismissal was officially listed as being on "medical" grounds. In response, Kraft sought legal advice from an attorney to challenge the grounds regarding his discharge. The Air Force, however, refused to change the status of his discharge.[26] Following his discharge, Kraft moved back into his parents' home and obtained work as a bartender.[27]

First known sexual assault[edit]
In March 1970, Kraft encountered a 13-year-old Westminster youth named Joseph Alvin Fancher at Huntington Beach.[28][29] Fancher explained to Kraft that he had run away from home that day. Kraft invited the youth to his apartment, promising that Fancher could live with him and offering him sex with a woman he claimed to know. Fancher agreed and accompanied Kraft to his Belmont Shore apartment, where he was drugged, beaten, and repeatedly sexually assaulted. Hours later, Fancher escaped from the apartment after Kraft left to go to work. A member of the public, alarmed by Fancher's drugged and disheveled condition, called an ambulance. Fancher's stomach needed to be pumped due to his ingested drugs.[30]
At the hospital, Fancher informed police that Kraft had given him drugs and beaten him.[31] He did not disclose to either his parents or the police that he had been sexually assaulted due to shame and fearing no one would believe him.[30][32] A search of Kraft's apartment was conducted with the cooperation of his roommate. However, as Fancher had confessed to police he had taken the pills offered to him voluntarily and the officers had searched without a warrant, no charges were filed.[33]

Enrollment at Long Beach State University[edit]
In 1971, Kraft found new employment as a forklift driver in Huntington Beach. After his military discharge two years earlier, he enrolled at Long Beach State University, majoring in education to further his career prospects. There, Kraft became acquainted with Jeff Graves, a fellow teaching student from Minnesota four years younger than Kraft, with whom he began a relationship.[34]

Murders[edit]
Between 1971 and 1983, Kraft is believed to have killed 67 victims. All of his suspected victims were males between the ages of 13 and 35,[13][35] the majority of whom were in their late teens to mid-twenties. Kraft was charged with—and convicted of—sixteen of these homicides, all of which had occurred between 1972 and 1983. Many of his victims were members of the United States Marines Corps,[36] and most of their bodies were found to have high levels of both alcohol and tranquilizers, indicating they had been unconscious when they were abused and killed.[37]
Kraft's victims were typically lured into his vehicle with an offer of a lift or alcohol. Once in Kraft's vehicle, the victims would be plied with alcohol and/or other drugs. They were then bound, tortured, and sexually abused before they were killed, usually by either strangulation, asphyxiation, or bludgeoning. However, some victims had also ingested lethal doses of pharmaceuticals. At least one victim was stabbed to death.[38] The victims would then be discarded, usually—though not exclusively—alongside or close to various freeways in southern California. Photographic evidence found at Kraft's home indicates several of his victims were driven to his house before their murder.[39]
Many of the victims were burned with a car cigarette lighter, usually around the genitals, chest, and face, and several were found with extensive blunt force trauma to the face and head.[40] In several instances, foreign objects were found inserted into the victims' rectums, while other victims had suffered emasculation, or mutilation and dismemberment.[41]
The majority of Kraft's murders were committed in California, although some victims had been killed in Oregon, with two further known victims murdered in Michigan in December 1982.[4]

First suspected murder victim[edit]
On October 5, 1971, police found the nude body of a 30-year-old Long Beach resident named Wayne Joseph Dukette discarded close to the Ortega Highway. Dukette, a bartender at a gay bar named "The Stable" in nearby Sunset Beach, had last been seen alive on September 20. Putrefaction had destroyed any signs of foul play on the body. The cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning due to a high blood alcohol level.[42] The first entry in Kraft's journal (referred to as his "scorecard") reads "Stable," leading investigators to believe Dukette was Kraft's first murder victim.[43][44][45]

Subsequent murders[edit]
Fifteen months after the murder of Dukette, Kraft killed a 20-year-old Marine named Edward Daniel Moore. Moore was last seen leaving the barracks at Camp Pendleton on December 24, 1972. His body was found beside the 405 Freeway in Seal Beach during the early hours of December 26. Abrasions on Moore's body indicated he had been pushed from a moving vehicle. An autopsy revealed he had been bound at the wrists and ankles, then beaten with a blunt instrument about the face before being garroted. His body also exhibited numerous bite marks, and a sock had been forced into his rectum.[46]

Six weeks after the murder of Moore, on February 6, 1973, the body of an unidentified male, estimated to be between 17 and 25 years old,[47] was found alongside the Terminal Island Freeway in Wilmington. This victim had been strangled with a ligature and also had a sock inserted in his rectum.[48] Two months later, on April 14, the body of 17-year-old Kevin Clark Bailey was found beside a road in Huntington Beach.[49][50] Bailey had been emasculated and sodomized prior to his murder. By July 28, a further two victims had been murdered: an unidentified youth whose dismembered body was found in Wilmington on April 22,[51][52] and a 20-year-old named Ronnie Gene Wiebe,[53] whose strangled body was discarded beside an on-ramp of the 405 Freeway on July 30, two days after he had disappeared.[54] Welt marks on Wiebe's wrists and ankles suggested he had been bound and suspended from a device before his murder.[55]
Kraft is known to have killed at least once more in 1973. The victim was a 23-year-old bisexual art student named Vincent Cruz Mestas, whose body was found in the San Bernardino Mountains on December 29.[9] As with several previous victims, one of the victim's socks had been forced into his rectum.[43] Mestas's hands had been severed from his body and were never found.[56]
By November 1974, five more victims had been found beside or close to major roadways in southern California, three of whom had been conclusively linked to the same killer. Two of these victims—20-year-old Malcolm Eugene Little and 19-year-old James Dale Reeves—had each been found beside a freeway with foreign objects inserted into their bodies, whereas the body of the third victim, 18-year-old Marine Roger Edward Dickerson, bore evidence of bite marks much like several earlier victims.[57]

1975[edit]
On January 3, 1975, Kraft abducted and murdered a 17-year-old high school student named John Leras.[58] The youth was last seen boarding a bus in Long Beach; his strangled body was found the following day, discarded at Sunset Beach with a foreign object protruding from his anus. Drag marks along the beach close to where his body was found suggested that two individuals had carried Leras's body into the water. Two weeks after this murder, on January 17, the body of a 21-year-old named Craig Jonaitis was found discarded in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel near the Pacific Coast Highway and Loynes Drive in Long Beach.[2] Jonaitis had been strangled to death with a length of string,[59] possibly a shoelace.

Investigation[edit]
By January 1975, a total of fourteen victims—whose bodies had been found discarded across four separate counties over the previous three years—had been linked to the same killer. All the victims had been Caucasian males with similar physical characteristics. On January 24, homicide investigators from several jurisdictions in southern California convened in Orange County to discuss their progress in the hunt for the unknown killer.[60] An FBI profile of the killer was read to investigators, describing the individual as a methodical, organized lust killer of above-average intelligence who exhibited an indifference to the "interests and welfare of society." [61]
Some investigators believed the murders to be the work of more than one individual, one or more of whom had a military background, as two victims had paper tissue residue in their nostrils, a procedure known to be used in the military to prevent bodies from purging after death. The insertion of socks inside the victims' rectums was also theorized to have been intended to prevent purging as the body was driven to the disposal location.[60] At this stage, investigators had no solid suspects.[62]

Murder of Keith Crotwell[edit]
On the evening of March 29, 1975, Kraft lured two youths, Keith Crotwell and Kent May, from a Long Beach parking lot into his Ford Mustang.[63] The youths were given beer and Valium as Kraft drove in a random, aimless manner around Belmont Shore and Seal Beach. May later recalled feeling catatonic as a result of the Valium and alcohol he had ingested before he passed out.[64]
In the parking lot where Crotwell and May had last been seen, two friends of the youths observed a distinctive black-and-white Mustang pull in and stop before the driver leaned across, opened the passenger door, and pushed the unconscious (but otherwise unharmed) May out onto the pavement. The driver then sped away from the scene. As he did so, the friends noted Crotwell slumped against the unknown driver's shoulder.[65]
On May 8, Crotwell's skull was found on a jetty close to the Long Beach Marina; the remainder of his body was found six months later.[66] After hearing the news, the two friends of Crotwell and May—who suspected that the murderer was a patron of a Belmont Shore gay bar—searched their neighborhood for the distinctive Mustang. They found the car less than a mile (1.6 km) from their home, wrote down the license plate number, and gave the information to the police. The vehicle was registered to Randy Kraft.[67]

Interrogation and release[edit]
Long Beach police questioned Kraft about Crotwell's abduction and murder on May 19, 1975. Initially, he denied having ever met either Crotwell or May, and the police, skeptical of Kraft's denial, summoned him to the police station for further questioning.[66] Kraft admitted that on or about March 29, he had encountered two youths in the Long Beach parking lot in question and persuaded them to drink alcohol and consume Valium with him as he drove. He claimed to have returned May to the parking lot and then to have driven with Crotwell to a side road close to the El Toro offramp, where his car subsequently became embedded upon an embankment. He claimed to have walked alone to a gas station to call a tow truck while Crotwell remained with the car. Upon returning to his vehicle, Kraft claimed, Crotwell had disappeared.[68]
Although Kraft's roommate confirmed that Kraft had phoned him on the date of Crotwell's disappearance, claiming that his vehicle was stuck on an embankment, detectives remained unconvinced by Kraft's version of events. The following week, two detectives attempted to file homicide charges against Kraft. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined, citing the coroner's conclusion from his autopsy of the remains thus far found (consisting only of Crotwell's skull) that the youth had died of accidental drowning.[69][70]
Perhaps because he had been questioned as a suspect in Crotwell's murder and because of additional turmoil in his personal life in the summer of 1975, Kraft is not known to have killed again until December 31, when he abducted 22-year-old Mark Hall in San Juan Capistrano.[69] In this instance, later described by prosecutors as "the worst" of all of Kraft's known murders,[39] Hall was driven to a remote canyon, where he was bound to a tree. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as asphyxiation caused by leaves and earth found lodged deep in Hall's trachea. The autopsy also revealed that Hall had been sodomized and emasculated, with his severed genitals inserted into his rectum. Additionally, his chest, scrotum, nose, and cheeks had been burned with an automobile cigarette lighter, which was also used to destroy his eyes. The autopsy report also listed numerous incisions on Hall's legs which had been inflicted with a broken bottle.[71] Forensic experts were able to determine that Hall had been alive throughout much of the ordeal.[72]

Relationship with Jeff Seelig[edit]
By 1976, Kraft had ended his relationship with Graves. Shortly thereafter, he began a relationship with a 19-year-old apprentice baker named Jeff Seelig, and the couple moved to Laguna Hills. Although neither man was inclined towards monogamy, the couple considered their relationship permanent.[69] Seelig later told investigators that he and Kraft regularly picked up and propositioned hitchhikers who, if willing, would accompany them to their apartment for a threesome. However, Seelig was adamant that Kraft had never been violent towards him and had never seen him display violent tendencies.
Kraft's relationship with Seelig is believed to be a contributory factor in the sudden lull in murders he is known to have committed.[73] He is not known to have killed again until December 10, 1976. The body of the victim, 19-year-old Paul Joseph Fuchs, has never been found. Nonetheless, Fuchs' name is clearly listed upon Kraft's scorecard, and he was last seen outside a Long Beach gay bar named "Ripples", which Kraft is known to have frequented.[74]

Resurfacing of the Freeway Killer[edit]
Following the December 1976 murder of Fuchs, Kraft is not known to have killed again for sixteen months. On January 3, 1978, homicide investigators again convened to discuss progress concerning the manhunt for the still-unidentified killer.[75] By this time, investigators knew there was more than one murderer at large: the previous July, police had arrested Patrick Kearney, who subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men, many of whom he had dissected and discarded in trash bags beside freeways in southern California. Although Kraft had dismembered some of his victims, he never killed his victims by shooting them in the temple as Kearney had.[75] Additionally, Kearney had never tortured any of his victims: his modus operandi differed significantly from Kraft's, and investigators were certain that an unrelated killer was still at large.
On April 16, 1978, Kraft abducted an 18-year-old Marine named Scott Michael Hughes. Hughes was plied with Valium before Kraft slit open his scrotum and removed one of his testicles, then strangled him to death with a ligature before discarding his fully clothed body—missing only his shoelaces—beside a freeway on-ramp in Anaheim. Two months later, on June 11, the body of 23-year-old Roland Gerald Young was found near a San Diego freeway. Young had been emasculated before being stabbed to death. Abrasions to his body indicated that he had been pushed from a vehicle traveling at high speed. Eight days later, the body of a 20-year-old Marine named Richard Allen Keith was found discarded beside a road on Moulton Parkway. He had last been seen alive by his girlfriend in the city of Carson. Welts on Keith's wrists indicated that he had been bound before he was strangled with a ligature. Froth in his throat indicated that he was also drowning as a result of flurazepam and alcohol he had consumed at the time he was strangled.[76] Keith is believed to be referred to on Kraft's scorecard as "Marine Carson."[77]
Three weeks after the murder of Keith, on July 6, Kraft killed a 23-year-old hitchhiker named Keith Arthur Klingbeil. Klingbeil had ingested large doses of acetaminophen and alcohol before he was strangled with his shoelace and his body discarded beside the Interstate 5 freeway.[78] Although Klingbeil was still alive when discovered, he would die shortly after his admission to Mission Community Hospital. A subsequent autopsy revealed that, before Klingbeil's strangulation, his left nipple had been seared with an automobile cigarette lighter.[79]
Two months later, on September 29, the body of 20-year-old Richard Anthony Crosby was found discarded 200 yards north of Highway 71 in San Bernardino.[80] Crosby had disappeared the previous day as he hitchhiked home from a theater in Torrance. He had been suffocated, and his left nipple had been mutilated with an automobile cigarette lighter.[81]
The last known victim murdered by Kraft in 1978 was a 21-year-old Long Beach truck driver named Michael Joseph Inderbieten, whose castrated body was found along an on-ramp to the I-605 on November 18, 1978.[82] In addition to having been castrated, Inderbieten had been violated with a foreign object and had suffered burns similar to those inflicted on victim Mark Hall two years previously. The cause of death was listed as suffocation.[79]

Later murders[edit]
Kraft is not known to have killed again until June 16, 1979, when he abducted a 20-year-old Marine named Donnie Harold Crisel, whose body was thrown from a moving vehicle onto the 405 Freeway. The cause of death was listed as acute alcohol poisoning, although rope and burn marks indicated Crisel had been bound and tortured prior to his body being discarded.[83]
Two months later, on August 29,[84] the dismembered remains of a 21-year-old English tourist named Keith Anthony Jackson were found discarded in two trash bags and a cardboard box behind a Union 76 gas station in Long Beach.[85] A sock was found inserted in his rectum. Only Jackson's head, torso and left leg were ever found.[86] Jackson had been deceased for several days prior to the discovery of his body.[87] The entry on Kraft's scorecard simply reading either "England" or "76" is believed to refer to him.[88] Two weeks later, on September 14, the body of 19-year-old Gregory Wallace Jolley was found in Lake Arrowhead.[89] Jolley had been emasculated and his head and legs had been severed after death. His possessions were later found in Kraft's home.[90]
On November 24, 1979, a 15-year-old Santa Ana youth named Jeffrey Sayre is believed to have been abducted and murdered by Kraft.[38] Sayre was last seen at a bus stop in Westminster[91] while returning home from a date with his girlfriend. The bus stop Sayre was last seen at was near the home of Kraft's parents.[92] The entry "Westminster Date" on Kraft's scorecard is believed to refer to Sayre. On February 18, 1980, the decapitated body of a 19-year-old Marine named Mark Alan Marsh was found near the Templin Highway. Marsh was last seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park.[93] His hands had been severed from his body after death.

Portland murders[edit]
In the summer of 1980, Kraft traveled to the neighboring state of Oregon on an extended business trip.[91] During this trip, he lived in a town close to Portland. Before returning to California in August, he is believed to have murdered two more victims—both of whom were listed on his scorecard with cryptic references, including the word "Portland."[94]
The first victim, a 17-year-old Denver youth named Michael Sean O'Fallon, was killed on July 17.[95] O'Fallon had been on a solo hitchhiking trip across the U.S. and Canada before his enrollment at college at the time of his murder. He had consumed both alcohol and Valium before he was strangled to death. O'Fallon's nude, hogtied body was discarded ten miles south of Salem.[95] O'Fallon was listed on Kraft's scorecard as "Portland Denver", and his camera—inscribed with his mother's initials—was later found in Kraft's garage.[96] The following day, Kraft is believed to have killed a man estimated to be aged between 35 and 45 years old[35] whose body was found beside a freeway in the city of Woodburn. This victim—listed as "Portland Elk" on Kraft's scorecard—had ingested a toxic level of Valium and Tylenol before he was strangled to death with a ligature.[97]

On September 3, 1980, one month after Kraft's return to California from Oregon, the bound body of a 19-year-old Marine named Robert Loggins was found discarded in a trash bag close to the El Toro Marine air base. Loggins had last been seen alive by two fellow Marines close to the Pacific Coast Highway on August 23. Photographs—and the negatives—subsequently found in Kraft's possession show Loggins in Kraft's living room slumped fully clothed on his sofa, apparently intoxicated, and in various nude, pornographic postures. All these pictures depict Loggins with his eyes closed; it is unknown whether the victim was alive or dead when they were taken.[99]
On April 10, 1981, the body of a 17-year-old youth named Michael Cluck was found beside the Interstate 5 freeway close to Goshen, Oregon.[40] Cluck had been abducted while hitchhiking from Kent, Washington, to Bakersfield, California,[100] the day prior to his body being discovered. Thirty-one blunt-force blows to the head had destroyed the back of his skull, killing the youth. Cluck had also been sodomized and savagely beaten, kicked, and scoured. Cluck is believed to have been recorded on Kraft's scorecard as "Portland Blood" due to the extensive blood and debris found at the murder scene. At the time of the murder, Kraft had once again been sent on assignment to Oregon by his employers. In addition, on the day Cluck's body was discovered, Kraft visited a Lane County hospital to receive treatment for a bruised foot.[95]
Four months after Cluck's murder, on August 20, 1981, the partially clothed body of 17-year-old male prostitute Christopher Allen Williams was found in the San Bernardino Mountains. Williams had ingested both phenobarbital and benzodiazepine, and was found with tissue paper lodged deep in his nostrils, causing him to choke to death on his own mucus.[101]

Echo Park murders[edit]
By early 1982, the relationship between Kraft and Seelig had become marred by frequent fights and episodes of temporary separation. In an effort to resolve their personal differences, the couple began attending weekly counseling sessions in Huntington Beach. These sessions began on June 22, 1982.
Following complaints from residents of Echo Park regarding a foul odor emanating from the direction of the Hollywood Freeway on July 29, 1982,[102] a Cal Trans employee found the decaying body of a 14-year-old[103] Pittsburg, California youth named Raymond Davis discarded alongside the Rampart Boulevard offramp. Rudimentary efforts had been made to conceal Davis's body beneath leaves and soil. He had last been seen alive in Echo Park on June 17,[104] searching for his missing dog. The youth's wrists had been knotted behind his back in much the same manner as had victim Michael O'Fallon two years previously, and he had been strangled to death with his shoelace. The entry on Kraft's scorecard reading "Dog" is believed to refer to Davis. Just forty feet from Davis's body, the same Cal Trans crew also found the body of 16-year-old Robert Avila.[105] Avila had been missing since July 21, and his body was also markedly decomposed.[104] He had been strangled to death with a length of stereo speaker wire.[106]
Kraft is not known to have killed again until November 1, 1982, when he abducted and murdered a 24-year-old Modesto man named Arne Mikeal Laine.[107] Laine was last seen hitchhiking towards Orange County in search of work. His body was not found until January 1984, discarded on a hillside close to the town of Ramona. Four weeks after Laine's murder, the semi-nude body of 26-year-old Brian Whitcher was dumped from a moving vehicle alongside the Interstate 5 freeway, close to the city of Wilsonville, Oregon. Whitcher had ingested high levels of both alcohol and Valium, but he died of asphyxiation.[95]
On December 3, 1982, a 29-year-old carpenter named Anthony Jose Silveira disappeared while hitchhiking towards Medford. His body was found two weeks later, strangled, sodomized, and violated with foreign objects before his murder. At the time of the murders of both Whitcher and Silveira, Kraft was again known to have been in Oregon on a business trip, which concluded the day of Silveira's death. On December 4, Kraft drove from Portland to Seattle to visit friends. During this brief visit, he was observed wearing a military jacket inscribed with the name "Silveira".[108] On December 5, Kraft flew from Seattle to Grand Rapids, Michigan—again on business.[108]

Grand Rapids and return to Portland[edit]
Two days after his arrival in Grand Rapids, Kraft encountered cousins Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn at a seminar in the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. Kraft was seen talking with the pair in the hotel's reception area shortly before midnight. Their bodies were discovered on December 9 in an open field close to the hotel.[38] Both victims had been plied with alcohol and Valium before their sodomy and murder, and the bodies had been arranged in sexually suggestive positions. Alt, aged 24, had died of asphyxiation, whereas Schoenborn, aged 20, had been strangled to death with his belt. In addition, a ballpoint pen had been inserted into Schoenborn's urethra before his murder. Both victims were recorded upon Kraft's scorecard in a single entry reading "GR2".[109] A set of keys belonging to Schoenborn, plus Silveira's military jacket, were left by Kraft in the hotel.[n 1]
On December 8, Kraft traveled from Michigan to Portland.[111] Within twenty-four hours of his return to Oregon, he had killed a 19-year-old hitchhiker named Lance Taggs. Taggs had last been seen hitchhiking from the city of Tigard to the home of a relative in Los Angeles on December 8.[112] His body was discovered the following day, discarded alongside a rural road in Clackamas County, close to where the body of Whitcher had been found just two weeks earlier.[80] As with Alt and Schoenborn, Taggs had consumed alcohol and Valium before his murder, although Taggs had died of suffocation caused by a sock thrust into his trachea.[112]

Connection of Oregon murders to manhunt[edit]
Noting the passage of time between periods of activity when bodies of young males had been found discarded near mass transportation with alcohol and/or pharmaceuticals in their bloodstream in Oregon, investigators theorized that their killer resided in another state and struck in Oregon only when there on business. Following the murders of Silveira, Whitcher, and Taggs, Oregon investigators relayed details of the murders to police in other states, describing the modus operandi of the killer they were seeking and requesting feedback from any police force that had unsolved murders of young males on their files with similar characteristics.[113] A response from southern California counties was swift: the pattern of killings was identical to victims linked to the unknown killer in California. The six Oregon murders committed by Kraft were thus linked to the murders he had committed in California.[110]

1983[edit]
Kraft did not kill again until January 27, 1983, when he abducted a 21-year-old hitchhiker named Eric Church. The victim was last seen alive hitchhiking from Orange County to Sacramento the day before his murder. His body was found discarded alongside I-605.[95] An autopsy concluded Church had consumed high levels of alcohol and Valium and that he had been sodomized. Rope marks on Church's wrists indicated he had struggled against his restraints before he died of a combination of ligature strangulation and numerous blows to the side of his skull inflicted by a blunt instrument.
On February 12, Kraft killed two Buena Park men: 18-year-old Geoffrey Nelson[114] and 20-year-old Rodger DeVaul. The two young men were last seen outside the house of a friend named Bryce Wilson shortly after midnight when they told Wilson they intended to purchase something to eat. Nelson's nude body was found alongside an offramp close to the Garden Grove Freeway several hours after he and DeVaul were last seen. He had been emasculated, strangled, and thrown from a moving vehicle.[115] DeVaul's body was found the following day, discarded down a mountainside close to Mount Baldy in San Bernardino County.[116] He had been bound, sodomized, and strangled with a cord. As had been the case with Nelson, DeVaul had ingested both alcohol and propranolol before his murder. In addition, the stomachs of both victims contained potato skins and grapes, which had been eaten shortly before their murders.[115]

Final murder and arrest[edit]
At 1:10 a.m. on May 14, 1983, two California Highway Patrol officers observed a Toyota Celica driving erratically on Interstate 5 in the Orange County community of Mission Viejo. Observing the vehicle perform an illegal lane change, the officers—suspecting the motorist was driving under the influence—signaled for the vehicle to stop.[117] The driver slowed the vehicle to a halt and exited the car, discarding the contents of a beer bottle onto the pavement as he did so. Officer Michael Sterling met the individual, who identified himself as Randy Kraft, at the front of his patrol car and observed that his jeans were unbuttoned. Sterling had Kraft perform a field sobriety test, which he failed. He then arrested Kraft for driving while intoxicated.[118]
Sterling's partner, Sgt. Michael Howard approached the Celica and observed a young man slumped with his eyes closed in the vehicle's passenger seat, partially covered by a jacket. Several empty Moosehead beer bottles and an open prescription bottle of Lorazepam tablets were strewn around his feet.[119] Howard attempted to wake the man. Receiving no response, Howard attempted to rouse the man by shaking his arm, only to note the individual had a low body temperature. Upon checking for a pulse, Howard noted the man was dead, with a ligature mark visible around his neck.[120] Lifting the jacket from the victim's lap, Howard noted the victim's jeans had been opened to expose his genitalia. In addition, the victim's hands had been bound with a shoelace, and his wrists bore evidence of welt marks. Later identified as Terry Lee Gambrel, a 25-year-old Marine stationed at El Toro air base, the victim had been strangled to death.[121]

Evidence retrieval[edit]
Kraft was initially charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and was held in custody as detectives conducted a thorough search of his vehicle. Upon the car's rear seat, investigators found a belt, the width of which matched the bruising around Gambrel's neck. Other incriminating evidence retrieved included alcohol, tranquilizers, various prescription drugs, and stimulants. The passenger seat and carpet of the vehicle were heavily bloodstained; however, Gambrel had no open wounds. The upholstery was removed for forensic analysis, which confirmed the blood was human. Beneath the carpet, investigators discovered an envelope containing more than 50 photographs of young men in pornographic poses. Many of the subjects in the pictures appeared to be either asleep or dead.[122] Inside the trunk, investigators found a ring binder containing a hand-written list of 61 coded notations.[123]
A search of Kraft's home revealed further incriminating evidence, including clothes and personal possessions of numerous young men who had been murdered over the previous decade.[124] Fibers taken from a rug matched those found on victim Scott Hughes. In addition, the couch in Kraft's living room was identified as being the one in the photographs found in Kraft's car.[4] A roll of film discovered also contained shots of victims Eric Church and Rodger DeVaul sitting in Kraft's car. A ligature mark is clearly visible on DeVaul's neck in one of these images.[125]

Scorecard[edit]
The coded list of 61 neatly printed terms and phrases found in the trunk of Kraft's car is believed to refer to each of Kraft's victims. Many entries appear innocuous, but each is believed to refer to a specific murder victim or double murder. Several entries reference victims' names (for example, the entry reading "EDM" refers to the initials of victim Edward Daniel Moore, whereas "Vince M" refers to victim Vincent Mestas). In other instances, entries indicate torture or mutilation inflicted upon victims' bodies and/or the locations where they were last seen. The entry "Marine Head BP," for example, is believed to refer to victim Mark Marsh; a Marine found decapitated, having been last seen hitchhiking towards Buena Park.[126] Other entries simply refer to body dump locations; the entry "Golden Sails," for example, refers to the fact the body of Craig Jonaitis was found in the parking lot of the Golden Sails Hotel.
The list also contains entries indicating a minimum of four double murders: "GR2" (victims Dennis Alt and Christopher Schoenborn, last seen in Grand Rapids); "2 in 1 Beach" (victims Geoffrey Nelson and Rodger DeVaul); "2 in 1 Hitch" and "2 in 1 MV to PL" (neither entry of which has been linked to any double murder or disappearance).
Investigators contend that two victims of whose murders Kraft was convicted (Church and Gambrel) are not listed on Kraft's scorecard. However, since the list is in code, the possibility exists that Church, in particular, is included on the scorecard as an entry that investigators cannot recognize as referring to him. Gambrel may also be included on the list; although Kraft was arrested while he attempted to dispose of the body, he may not have recorded an entry referring to Gambrel on his scorecard. These possibilities indicate the scorecard lists a minimum of 65 and possibly 67 victims.

Formal charges[edit]
On May 16, 1983, Kraft was formally charged with the murder of Gambrel.[4] By September, investigators had interviewed over 700 witnesses and had gathered more than 250 physical exhibits which pointed towards Kraft's guilt in a further fifteen homicides committed between December 1972 and February 1983.[127][128] He was formally charged with these fifteen murders—in addition to two counts of sodomy and one of emasculation—on September 8, 1983.[129]

Trial[edit]
Kraft's trial began on September 26, 1988. He was tried in Orange County before Judge Donald A. McCartin.[135] At the trial, almost 160 witnesses were called to testify on behalf of the prosecution. Over 1,000 exhibits were introduced as evidence.[1] These exhibits included physical evidence such as bloodstains, hair and fiber evidence found at Kraft's Long Beach residence and in his car; fingerprints found upon glass shards recovered from the Hall murder scene;[136] negatives and photographs of victims found hidden inside Kraft's vehicle, which depicted the men either dead, drugged, or asleep;[71][n 2] the belt used to strangle Gambrel. The prescription drugs and buck knife found in his vehicle. Other evidence introduced included work and travel records and gasoline receipts, which placed Kraft in particular locations where victims had been abducted and/or discarded, and the numerous personal possessions of various murder victims found in Kraft's possession following his arrest.
Kraft's defense was primarily one of alibis and alternate suspects: his attorneys dismissed much of the evidence produced as being circumstantial and attempted to portray Kraft as an articulate, hardworking, and upstanding member of the community. They did not dispute that the 16 men were murder victims yet argued that they were "victims of someone, but not Randy Kraft."[137] The defense also pointed out that investigators had initially believed several of the 16 victims to have been killed by one of two other serial killers, Patrick Kearney and William Bonin, and argued there was "no concrete evidence" that Kraft had killed any of the victims.
The trial lasted a total of thirteen months and would prove to be the most expensive trial in Orange County history.[138][139] On April 29, 1989, each side opened their closing arguments, which lasted a total of three days: the prosecution again listing all the physical and circumstantial evidence pointing to Kraft's guilt; the defense arguing as to the circumstantial case put forward by the prosecution that all the murders were linked and accusing the prosecution of "glossing over" the truth. Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for eleven days before reaching their verdict. On May 12, 1989, Kraft was found guilty of sixteen counts of murder, one count of sodomy, and one count of emasculation.[n 3]



"To have something like this take place in our society, I [...] I think I've sent eight or nine individuals to their death in my courtroom before. I can take all those aggravating circumstances in those other cases and they don't match Mr. Kraft's record. I just can't comment. If anyone ever deserved the death penalty, he's got it coming."


Judge Donald A. McCartin passing the death sentence upon Randy Kraft on November 29, 1989.[141]

Penalty phase[edit]
On June 5, 1989, the same jury reconvened to hear further testimony from the prosecution and defense regarding Kraft's penalty. This phase of Kraft's trial would last until August,[124] and it was at this point that the prosecution introduced evidence of several additional homicides committed in both Oregon and Michigan, which they were certain Kraft had also committed and for which he had not been tried in Orange County. The defense dismissed the prosecution's assertions as being "highly speculative"[142] and introduced testimony relating to a PET scan conducted on Kraft which, they asserted, revealed abnormalities in the frontal lobes of his brain, therefore reducing his ability to control both his emotions and impulse.[143] The prosecution rebuffed this testimony by stating to the jury: "There is nothing wrong with Mr. Kraft's mind other than that he likes killing for sexual satisfaction", adding that the fact that his family and friends had found it difficult to believe he had committed any murders simply showed "what a good salesman he is."

Conviction and incarceration[edit]
On August 11, 1989, the jury rendered a verdict of death.[144] Three months later, on November 29, Judge McCartin formally sentenced Kraft to death. The sentence was upheld by the California Supreme Court on August 9, 2000.[145]

As of 2024[update], Kraft remains on death row at San Quentin State Prison. He continues to deny responsibility for any of the homicides he was either convicted of or suspected of committing.

Missing accomplice[edit]
Both circumstantial and DNA evidence relating to some of Kraft's murders have caused many to strongly suspect that not all of the murders attributed to Kraft were committed by one person. The prosecution believed these inconsistencies could only be explained by the presence of an accomplice. It is contended that Kraft would have had difficulty moving around 200-pound (90 kg) corpses. Dumping them from moving vehicles alone would also be difficult to do unnoticed.
Abrasions and debris found at some of the crime scenes, where bodies had been discarded upon or alongside freeways, indicated that they had been discarded from vehicles traveling at more than 50 miles per hour, and for one individual to perform this act without compromising his driving would be very difficult. Moreover, footprints in the sand close to where the body of John Leras was found at Sunset Beach in 1975 unequivocally indicate two people had carried the youth's body to where it was discarded. In the case of Eric Church, semen samples found on his body were inconsistent with Kraft's blood type, and, while the photographs of the victims found in Kraft's car had to have been processed somewhere, no photo developer ever reported Kraft's morbid images to the police. (Kraft himself had no darkroom expertise or darkroom equipment.)
During Kraft's trial, members of the prosecution admitted privately that they did not charge him with several murders that they were certain he had committed because of facts relating to the cases, which indicated more than one perpetrator.[146] Although DNA evidence found upon the body of Church was incompatible with Kraft, investigators had found photographs depicting Church in Kraft's car and his distinctive Norelco electric razor was also found in Kraft's house.[147]

Jeff Graves[edit]
The prosecution believed Kraft's former lover Jeff Graves may have assisted Kraft in several murders. Graves, who had lived with Kraft between 1971 and 1976 (when sixteen known murders attributed to Kraft occurred), had been questioned concerning the Crotwell abduction and murder in 1975 when he verified part of Kraft's statement to police. When questioned further about the incident following Kraft's arrest in 1983, Graves had informed investigators: "I'm really not going to pay for it, you know."[148] Graves died of AIDS on July 27, 1987.[149] At the time of his death, police had been preparing to question him further.

Bob Jackson[edit]
In January 2000, journalist Dennis McDougal, the author of a 1991 book about Kraft entitled Angel of Darkness,[150] published an article which recounted interviews with a small-time criminal named Bob Jackson, who reportedly confessed to murdering two hitchhikers with Kraft: one in Wyoming in 1975 and another in Colorado in 1976. Authorities in both Colorado and Wyoming were unable to corroborate these claims.[146]
Jackson also claimed to McDougal that Kraft's scorecard included only his "more memorable" murders; in Jackson's opinion, Kraft's total body count stood closer to 100. McDougal reported these allegations to the police and provided tape recordings of the interviews. Detectives interrogated Jackson and eventually persuaded him to enter a mental institution; no murder charges were filed against him due to an absence of direct incriminating evidence.[151]
Kraft sued McDougal and the publisher of Angel of Darkness in 1993, seeking $62 million in damages. The suit contended that the book smeared his "good name", unjustly portrayed him as a "sick, twisted man", and destroyed his prospects for future employment by ruining his chances of overturning his conviction on appeal.[152] The lawsuit was dismissed by the California Supreme Court in June 1994.[153]

Potential unverified scorecard victims[edit]
By 1988, investigators had linked forty-three of the sixty-one entries upon Kraft's scorecard to identified and nameless young men murdered in the twelve years previous to Kraft's arrest, leaving eighteen entries referring to twenty unidentified and/or undiscovered murder victims.
Three further victims simply listed at trial as being entries "unconnected to any unsolved murder"—"Navy White," "Iowa," and "Hari Kari"—have since been identified and/or linked to four murder victims discovered in 1974 and 1975.[n 4] A further victim unidentified at trial yet linked to Kraft as an entry simply reading "76" due to the location of his body behind a Union 76 gas station has since been identified as Keith Jackson, a tourist from Manchester, England, meaning he may have been the entry in Kraft's journal logged as "England" as opposed to "76".[155] These developments leave fifteen entries referring to seventeen unknown further victims upon Kraft's scorecard. This is due in part to his murders having occurred in several states, with bodies being discarded in varying locations, and several entries being cryptic.
The entry upon Kraft's scorecard reading "Navy White" is believed by investigators to refer to a 17-year-old named James Sean Cox, an apprentice medic stationed at Mather Air Force Base who was last seen on September 29, 1974, hitchhiking near Interstate 5[156] and whose body was found several weeks later in Rancho Santa Fe. Cox was dressed in his white Navy uniform at the time of his disappearance. In addition to the color of his uniform, Cox was a blond youth.
A further entry on Kraft's scorecard, simply reading "Iowa," is believed to refer to either an 18-year-old Marine named Oral Alfred Stuart, Jr., who had been born in Iowa, or a 17-year-old Cedar Rapids native named Michael Ray Schlicht. Stuart's body was found discarded close to a Long Beach condominium on November 10, 1974;[157] he had died as a result of blunt force trauma.[158] His body remained unidentified until March 2012. Schlicht's body was discovered in Laguna Hills on September 14, 1974; he had died approximately four days prior to the discovery of his body, although his family had last seen him in April 1974. His cause of death was initially determined to be accidental due to alcohol and Valium intoxication, but was later reclassified as a homicide. His body remained unidentified until November 2023.[159] Investigators note the similarity of modus operandi in the murder and body disposal of both men to that of other victims Kraft is known to have killed.
One unknown entry upon the scorecard reads "Hari Kari." This entry may refer to the stabbing murder of 30-year-old David Michael Sandt, who was found sexually assaulted and stabbed to death close to a vacant house in Long Beach on January 13, 1975. The multiple stab wounds inflicted were to Sandt's stomach, and his body was found in a kneeling position with his arms extended in front of him in a position reminiscent of the Japanese ritual suicide practice known as Hara-kiri.[160]

Other "Freeway Killers"[edit]
Patrick Kearney, a suspect in a series of killings of young men known as the "Trash Bag Murders", surrendered to Riverside Police in July 1977. He subsequently confessed to the murders of 28 boys and young men, many of whom he had also discarded along freeways in southern California. Although Kraft is also known to have dismembered some of his victims, Kearney invariably killed his victims by shooting them in the temple. In addition, Kearney discarded the majority of his victims' bodies in trash bags. Although primarily known as the Trash Bag Murderer, Kearney is also known as the Freeway Killer.[161]
In 1980, William Bonin and four known accomplices were arrested for a series of killings known as the "Freeway Murders," which displayed a markedly similar disposal method to those committed by Kraft. Bonin is also known to have tortured his victims, although he never plied his victims with alcohol or drugs. In addition, although he is known to have stabbed some victims' genitalia with a knife and one victim to death, Bonin never mutilated their bodies, and almost all of his victims were strangled to death with their own T-shirts. Moreover, the majority of Bonin's victims were younger than those of Kraft, with the age range of his victims being 12 to 19 years.[162]

Rupert I "the Red", Elector Palatine (German: Ruprecht der Rote; 9 June 1309, Wolfratshausen – 16 February 1390, Neustadt an der Weinstraße) was Count Palatine of the Rhine from 1353 to 1356, and Elector Palatine from 10 January 1356 to 16 February 1390.
He was the son of Rudolf I, Duke of Bavaria and Mechtild of Nassau, the daughter of Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg, King of Germany. With the death of his brother, Rudolf II, on 4 October 1353, he inherited his domains and became sole Count for the territory, whereas they had previously shared that privilege.
The Golden Bull of 1356 guaranteed the Palatinate the right of participating in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor.  Previous Counts Palatine had participated in other Imperial elections.
In 1386, Rupert founded Heidelberg University, the third university in the Holy Roman Empire, which was named after him.
Rupert was married twice: firstly to Elisabeth, Countess of Namur (daughter of John I, Marquis of Namur), secondly to Beatrix of Jülich-Berg, the great-granddaughter of his elder brother Adolf, Count Palatine of the Rhine.  Neither marriage produced an heir.
He was succeeded by his nephew, Rupert II, Elector Palatine, grandfather of his second wife.[1]

The New American Movement (NAM) was an American New Left multi-tendency socialist and feminist political organization established in 1971.
The NAM continued an independent existence until 1983, when it merged with Michael Harrington's Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee to establish the Democratic Socialists of America.


Organizational history[edit]
Establishment[edit]
The NAM was established at a conference held in Davenport, Iowa in December 1971 by radical political activists seeking to create a successor organization to Students for a Democratic Society (SDS).[1] SDS, the leading organization of the New Left movement in the United States, had recently disintegrated into warring political sects and the need was perceived for a broad-based new organization free of sectarian rancor.
The founding activists behind the NAM were vigorous opponents of the war in Vietnam who sought a new organization to serve as a forum for discussing where and how to redirect their activities. The call to convene was issued by Michael Lerner. Lerner became distant from the organization shortly after it was founded and went on to start the magazine Tikkun.
In its early years, the NAM shared much of the political framework of the New Communist Movement, but rejected the strategy of building a "vanguard party", a position prominent NAM members defended in a debate in the pages of The Guardian. The organization was built around local groups called "chapters" which emphasized Marxist study, discussion of contemporary issues, support of local labor actions and work in the community to raise awareness.
The national headquarters of NAM were located in Chicago.

Development[edit]

By the early 1980s, after a great change in the American political climate and the departure of some of its more radical members, the NAM had moved away from its original neo-Leninist orientation. It adopted a more traditionally social democratic outlook, culminating in a merger with the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) in 1982 to form the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).[2]  At the time of the merger, the NAM claimed 2,500 members.[3]
Richard Healey, son of Los Angeles Communist Party USA (CPUSA) leader Dorothy Healey, was a NAM leader from its founding in 1971. After his mother resigned from the CPUSA in 1973, Healey worked on recruiting her to the NAM, which she joined in 1974. In 1975, Dorothy joined Richard on the NAM's National Interim Committee and later became a Vice Chair of the DSA in 1982.[4]
The NAM made use of comparatively high membership dues which were tiered on the basis of the member's income. According to one analyst, total membership of the organization never exceeded 1,500 at any point in the group's existence.[1] Membership was based almost wholly in large metropolitan areas and on college campuses.[1] NAM activity often took the form of a group study circle dedicated to the collective study of Marxist or feminist writings. The group was ultimately hampered by its limited size and seeming inability to progress beyond the realm of doctrinal discourse into the world of practical politics.[1]

Press organs[edit]
The NAM's official organ was a magazine called Movin' On. The independent journals Radical America and Socialist Revolution (later Socialist Review) were also vaguely associated with the NAM as were the weekly independent socialist newspapers The Guardian and In These Times which had their share of supporters both within NAM and in other radical groups.
In addition to its magazine, the NAM produced several other targeted publications, including the Reproductive Rights Newsletter, dedicated to organizing to preserve women's rights of access to contraception and abortion, the Anti-Racism Bulletin and Women Organizing, a publication launched in 1979 and dedicated to questions of feminist organizing.[5]

Dissolution[edit]
The NAM continued an independent existence until March 1983, when it voted to merge with Michael Harrington's Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) to establish the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).[6]

Jefes de Ciudad Juárez (English: Ciudad Juárez Chiefs) are an American football team based in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. The Jefes compete in the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA), the top American football league in Mexico, after playing its inaugural season in the Fútbol Americano de México league. The team plays its home games at the Estadio 20 de Noviembre, with a capacity of 5,000 seated spectators.[1]


History[edit]
On 18 March 2022, the team was presented at a press conference in Ciudad Juárez as an expansion team in the Fútbol Americano de México (FAM) league, with César Durán as the owner and president and David Silva as its first head coach.[2][3] The inaugural 48-man roster was revealed the following month and included 16 foreign players, all with NCAA Division I or Division II experience.[4]
The Jefes played their first game on 30 April 2022, kicking off the 2022 season with an 18–0 victory over the Bulldogs de Naucalpan at the Estadio Jaime Labastida.[5] Andre Dowdell caught the first touchdown in team history from quarterback Andrés Chío in their first drive.[5] The following week, the Jefes lost 18–16 to the Rojos CDMX in their home opener.[6] After another loss in week 3, the team fired head coach David Silva and promoted linebackers coach Mario Diaz to the position.[7] The Jefes finished their inaugural season with a 3–5 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs.[8]

League change[edit]
On 30 September 2022, the FAM league announced it was shutting down operations, leaving the Jefes without a league.[6] In October, the team announced it was joining the Liga de Fútbol Americano Profesional (LFA) for its upcoming season with Lorenzo Gathers as the new head coach.[9][10] He became the first non-Mexican coach in LFA history.[11]
On 26 March, Jefes fired Lorenzo Gathers after the team failed to win a single game on their first four matches; Gathers was replaced by Randall Mendoza.[12] Later, Gathers published a letter in which he pointed out the team's disorganization, such as not paying the players and staff and not allowing him to choose his coaching staff.[13]

Lewisham (/ˈluːɪʃəm/ ⓘ LOO-ish-əm) is a London borough in south-east London, England. It forms part of Inner London. The principal settlement of the borough is Lewisham. The local authority is Lewisham London Borough Council, based in Catford. The Prime Meridian passes through Lewisham. Blackheath, Goldsmiths, University of London and Millwall F.C. are located within the borough.


History[edit]
The borough was formed in 1965, by the London Government Act 1963, as an amalgamation of the former area of the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham and the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford, which had been created in 1900 as divisions of the County of London.[1]
Minor boundary changes have occurred since its creation. The most significant amendments were made in 1996, when the former area of the Royal Docks in Deptford was transferred from the London Borough of Greenwich.[2]
The metropolitan borough of Lewisham corresponded to the ancient parishes of Lee and Lewisham and the borough of Deptford corresponded to the parish of Deptford St Paul, including Hatcham. Prior to becoming part of the County of London in 1889, Hatcham was part of Surrey and the rest was part of Kent.

Geography[edit]
Locations in and around the London Borough of Lewisham
See also: List of districts in Lewisham
The borough is surrounded by the Royal Borough of Greenwich to the east (where the border runs between Deptford and Horn Park), the London Borough of Bromley to the south (where the border runs between Horn Park and Crystal Palace Park), and the London Borough of Southwark to the west ( where the border runs between Crystal Palace Park and Rotherhithe). The River Thames forms a short section of northern boundary with the Isle of Dogs in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Deptford Creek, Pool River, River Quaggy and River Ravensbourne pass through the borough.
Major landmarks include All Saints Church in Blackheath, the Citibank Tower in Lewisham, Dietrich Bonhoeffer Church (Sydenham's German Church, technically located in Forest Hill) and the Horniman Museum in Forest Hill. Millwall F.C. are based in the borough, their stadium The Den being located in South Bermondsey.

Demographics[edit]
Population pyramid of the Borough of Lewisham

St Teilo's Church, Llandeloy, is a redundant church in the village of Llandeloy, Pembrokeshire, Wales, dedicated to Saint Teilo.  It has been designated by Cadw as a Grade II listed building,[1] and is under the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches.[2]


History[edit]
The church probably originated in the 12th century, and later served as the village school.  However, by the 1840s it was a ruin.[3]  It was rebuilt in 1926–27 from the ruins, and was designed by the architect John Coates Carter.[2]  The design followed Arts and Crafts principles, that is, to use the simplest available local materials, without attempting to copy the style of any particular period.[1]  After the church was closed in 2002, it was taken into the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches.[2]

Architecture[edit]
Exterior[edit]
St Teilo's is constructed in stone rubble with a slate roof.[1]  It has a "humble exterior".[4]  At the west end is a double-arched gabled bellcote.  Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel, with a south transept.[1]  The chancel inclines slightly to the right.[3]  The west window is "tiny".  In the north wall of the nave is an arched doorway and a long window, and in the south wall are two square-headed windows. At the east end is a single pointed window.  In the north wall of the chancel is a long narrow window and the south wall has two square-headed windows.  In the transept are two long lancet windows on the south wall. All the windows have rough (not ashlar) jambs.[1]

Interior[edit]
The interior is "beautiful and evocative".[4]  It is long and low, with exposed stone walls.[1]  The rood screen with its loft dominates the interior.[4] The loft has a carving of the Crucifixion on its front.  In the angle between the rood screen and the north wall is a simple three-sided pulpit.  The loft is reached by a stairway in the north wall.  In the nave, the pews are simple, with open backs.[1]  There are two stone fonts.  One is built from ancient stones found during the excavation carried out before the church was rebuilt.  The other is octagonal, standing on three steps.  The reredos consists of a rectangular wooden panel painted in gesso and coloured with tempera.  Its frame is elaborately carved.  Also in the church are a stoup, and a pair of piscinas carved from slate.[4]  The stained glass in the east window and in the transept date from about 1926, and that in the nave south windows from about 1936.[1]

The Seattle General Strike was a five-day general work stoppage by 65,000 workers in the city of Seattle, Washington from February 6 to 11, 1919. The goal was to support shipyard workers in several unions who were locked out  of their jobs when they tried to strike for higher wages. Most other local unions joined the walk-out, including members of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The national offices of the AFL unions were opposed to the shutdown. Local, state and federal government officials, the press, and much of the public viewed the strike as a radical attempt to subvert American institutions.
The strike's demand for higher wages came within months of the end of World War I, the original justification for the wage controls. From 1915 to 1918, Seattle had seen a big increase in union membership, and some union leaders were inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917. Some commentators blamed the strike on Bolsheviks and other radicals inspired by "un-American" ideologies, making it the first expression of the anti-left sentiment that characterized the Red Scare of 1919 and 1920.[3]


Background[edit]
In these years, more workers in the city were organized in unions than ever before. There was a 400 percent increase in union membership from 1915 to 1918. At the time, workers in the United States, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, were becoming increasingly radicalized, with many in the rank and file supportive of the recent revolution in Russia and working toward a similar revolution in the United States. In the fall of 1919, for instance, Seattle longshoremen refused to load arms destined for the anti-Bolshevik White Army in Russia and attacked those who attempted to load them.[4]
The arrival of the Russian steamship Shilka in Seattle on December 24, 1917 added to the thought of Bolshevik involvement. The ship had been damaged and thrown off course in a storm and limped its way into the port almost out of fuel, food and fresh water.  The U.S. Attorney in Seattle was tipped off by an "informant" that the ship was coming and it was going to "aid the enemy."[5] The enemy at this time would have been the labor parties threatening a strike.  Many believed that its arrival signified a Bolshevik connection with the labor unrest in Seattle. A lot of rumors came about because of this ship's arrival. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer ran a front-page article about an I.W.W. ship being held that contained over a hundred thousand dollars to help I.W.W. members get out of jail.[6] This article proved to be false as the search of the vessel by local law enforcement turned up nothing of significance. A first-hand account of a sailor aboard the ship claimed that there was no evidence found on board because the only contentious material was some flyers in a briefcase that were carried off of the ship upon its arrival.[7] Another passenger that arrived with the ship was arrested for taking part in labor talks with one of the unions in the area.[8] Although there was never any concrete evidence connecting the Shilka to the labor parties of Seattle, there was enough to show that the labor parties at the least had the support of Bolshevik Russia. There was a lot of fear of the Bolsheviks because it was known that they had been hoping for a revolution in the Western world in order to support Russia by pooling resources.[9]
Most unions in Seattle were officially affiliated with the AFL, but the ideas of ordinary workers tended to be more radical than their leaders. A local labor leader from the time discussed the politics of Seattle's workers in June 1919:[10]

I believe that 95 percent of us agree that the workers should control the industries. Nearly all of us agree on that but very strenuously disagree on the method. Some of us think we can get control through the Cooperative movement, some of us think through political action, and others think through industrial action.
Another journalist described the spread of propaganda relating to the Russian Revolution:[10]

For some time these pamphlets were seen by hundreds on Seattle's streetcars and ferries, read by men of the shipyards on their way to work. Seattle's businessmen commented on the phenomenon sourly; it was plain to everyone that these workers were conscientiously and energetically studying how to organize their coming to power. Already, workers in Seattle talked about "workers' power" as a practical policy for the not far distant future.
Strike[edit]
Seattle shipyard workers leave the shipyard after going on strike, 1919.
A few weeks after the November 1918 armistice ended World War I, unions in Seattle's shipbuilding industry demanded a pay increase for unskilled workers. They formed the Seattle Metal Trades Council, made up of delegates from twenty-one different craft unions; there were seventeen at the time of the first strike vote. At the time of the General Strike, these separate unions no longer made separate agreements with the yard-owners; a single blanket-agreement was made at intervals by the Metal Trades Council for all the crafts comprising it. In August 1917, the workers had succeeded in establishing a uniform wage scale for one third of the metal tradesmen working in the city.[11] At the time of the general strike, James Taylor was president of the Council.[12]
In an attempt to divide the ranks of the union, the yard owners responded by offering a pay increase only to skilled workers. The union rejected that offer and Seattle's 35,000 shipyard workers went on strike on January 21, 1919.[13]
Controversy erupted when Charles Piez, head of the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC), an enterprise created by the federal government as a wartime measure and the largest employer in the industry, sent a telegram to the yard owners threatening to withdraw their contracts if any increase in wages were granted. The message intended for the Metal Trades Association, the owners, was accidentally delivered to the Metal Trades Council, the union. The shipyard workers responded with anger directed at both their employers and the federal government which, through the EFC, seemed to be siding with corporate interests.[13]
The workers immediately appealed to the Seattle Central Labor Council for a general strike of all workers in Seattle. Members of various unions were polled, with almost unanimous support in favor–even among traditionally conservative unions. As many as 110 locals officially supported the call for a general strike to begin on February 6, 1919, at 10:00 am.[14] Among the strikers were war veterans who wore their uniforms as they went on strike.[15]: 86–87 

Life during the strike[edit]
The strike committee set up soup kitchens and distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day. In the photo, a woman serves a plate of food to a striking worker.[14]
A cooperative body made up of rank and file workers from all the striking locals were formed during the strike, called the General Strike Committee. It acted as a "virtual counter-government for the city."[16] The committee organized to provide essential services for the people of Seattle during the work stoppage. For instance, garbage that would create a health hazard was collected, laundry workers continued to handle hospital laundry, and firemen remained on duty. Exemptions to the stoppage of labor had to be passed by the Strike Committee, and authorized vehicles bore signs to that effect.[14][16] In general, work was not halted if doing so would endanger lives.[16]
In other cases, workers acted on their own initiative to create new institutions. Milk wagon drivers, after being denied the right by their employers to keep certain dairies open, established a distribution system of 35 neighborhood milk stations. A system of food distribution was also established, which throughout the strike committee distributed as many as 30,000 meals each day. Strikers paid twenty-five cents per meal, and the general public paid thirty-five cents.  Beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee were offered on an all-you-can-eat basis.[14]
Army veterans created an alternative to the police in order to maintain order. A group called the "Labor War Veteran's Guard" forbade the use of force and did not carry weapons, and used "persuasion only."[14] Peacekeeping proved unnecessary. The regular police forces made no arrests in actions related to the strike, and general arrests dropped to less than half their normal number. Major General John F. Morrison, stationed in Seattle, claimed that he had never seen "a city so quiet and orderly."[14] The methods of organization adopted by the striking workers bore resemblance to anarcho-syndicalism, perhaps reflecting the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World in the Pacific Northwest,[citation needed] though only a few striking locals were officially affiliated with the IWW.[14]

Radical visions[edit]
The pamphlet entitled "Russia Did It."
Revolutionary pamphlets littered the streets of the city. One called "Russia Did It" proclaimed: "The Russians have shown you the way out. What are you going to do about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die unless you wake up, realize that you and the boss have nothing in common, that the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers, must take over the control of your jobs, and through them, the control over your lives instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week, so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil."[17]
In an editorial in the Seattle Union Record, a union newspaper, pro-Soviet activist Anna Louise Strong, although not a union member tried to use the general strike's power and potential to have the workers seize the industries of Seattle:[18][19]

The closing down of Seattle's industries, as a MERE SHUTDOWN, will not affect these eastern gentlemen much. They could let the whole northwest go to pieces, as far as money alone is concerned.
But, the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, while the workers organize to feed the people, to care for the babies and the sick, to preserve order – this will move them, for this looks too much like the taking over of power by the workers.
Labor will not only Shut Down the industries, but Labor will reopen, under the management of the appropriate trades, such activities as are needed to preserve public health and public peace. If the strike continues, Labor may feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities.
UNDER ITS OWN MANAGEMENT.

And that is why we say that we are starting on a road that leads – no one knows where!
Newspapers across the country reprinted excerpts from Strong's editorial.[20]

End of the general strike[edit]

Three simultaneous movements brought the strike to an end: Mayor Ole Hanson increased the police and military forces available to enforce order, though there was no disorder, and possibly to take the place of striking workers. Union officials, especially those more senior and those at higher levels of the labor movement, feared that using the general strike as a tactic would fail and set back their organizing efforts. Union members, perhaps seeing the strength of the forces arrayed against them, perhaps mindful of their union leaders concerns began to go back to work.[citation needed] The General Strike Committee attributed the end of the strike to pressure from international union officers and the difficulty of continuing to live in the shut-down city.[21]
Mayor Hanson had federal troops available and stationed 950 sailors and marines across the city by February 7. He added 600 men to the police force and hired 2,400 special deputies, students from the University of Washington for the most part.[15]: 87  On February 7, Mayor Hanson threatened to use 1,500 police and 1,500 troops to replace striking workers the next day, but the strikers assumed this was an empty threat and were proved correct.[22] The Mayor continued his rhetorical attack on February 9, saying that the "sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in Petrograd."[23] Mayor Hanson told reporters that "any man who attempts to take over the control of the municipal government functions will be shot."[24]

The mayor's newly hired deputies receive their weapons.
The international offices of some of the unions and the national leadership of the AFL began to exert pressure on the General Strike Committee and individual unions to end the strike.[25] Some locals gave in to this pressure and returned to work. The executive committee of the General Strike Committee, pressured by the AFL and international labor organizations, proposed ending the general strike at midnight on February 8, but their recommendation was voted down by the General Strike Committee.[25] On February 8, some streetcar operators returned to work and restored some critical city transportation services. Seattle's main department store reopened as well.[26] Then teamsters and newsboys returned to work.[27] On February 10, the General Strike Committee voted to end the general strike on February 11 and by noon on that day it was over.[28] It stated its reasons: "Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees of unions, from the 'leaders' in the labor movement, even from those very leaders who are still called 'Bolsheviki' by the undiscriminating press. And, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed."[29]: 35 [30]
The city had been effectively paralyzed for five days, but the general strike collapsed as labor reconsidered its effectiveness under pressure from senior labor leaders and their own obvious failure to match the Mayor's propaganda in the war for public opinion.[citation needed] The shipyard strike, in support of which the general strike had been called, persisted.[31]

Aftermath[edit]
Newspaper caption, "How the Great Seattle Strike was broken - Our photo shows machine gun crews ready to fire upon the strikers. Police, soldiers and armed civilians were used by Mayor Hanson"
Hanson, July 1, 1919
Immediately following the general strike's end, thirty-nine IWW members were arrested as "ringleaders of anarchy".[32]
Seattle Mayor Ole Hanson took credit for ending the strike and was hailed by some of the press. He resigned a few months later and toured the country giving lectures on the dangers of "domestic Bolshevism." He earned $38,000 in seven months, five times his annual salary as mayor.[33] He agreed that the general strike was a revolutionary event. In his view, the fact that it was peaceful proved its revolutionary nature and intent. He wrote:[17][32]

The so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That there was no violence does not alter the fact... The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here first, then everywhere... True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt—no matter how achieved.
Between the strike's announcement and beginning, on February 4, the U.S. Senate voted to expand the work of its Overman Judiciary Subcommittee from investigating German spies to Bolshevik propaganda. The Committee launched a month of hearings on February 11, the day the strike collapsed. Its sensational report detailed Bolshevik atrocities and the threat of domestic agitators bent on revolution and the abolition of private property. The labor radicalism represented by the Seattle General Strike fit neatly into its conception of the threat American institutions faced.[34]

Kadmi Cohen (ca. 1930)
(Isaac) Kadmi Cohen (1892–1944) was a French writer.  Born in 1892 in Łódź (Poland), he emigrated to Palestine, where he studied at Lyceum Herzliah in Tel Aviv. In 1914 he joined as a volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. In 1920 he was naturalized French due to his participation in the war.
He was a lawyer and the founder of the Paris Union of young lawyers. In 1922 he discussed a dissertation in philosophy entitled "Introduction à l'histoire des institutions sociales et politiques chez les Sémites". He was an activist in the French Zionist mouvement and was a supporter of Vladimir Jabotinsky's Revisionism. He published numerous articles in "Mercure de France" dealing with Jewish matters and Zionism.
He married a Frenchwoman, who converted to Judaism in the early 1920s. They had 3 children, Olivier Cohen-Steiner (1936-2019), Jean-François Steiner (*1938), and Josée Steiner (*1939). Jean-François Steiner became an author whose book Treblinka: The Revolt of an Extermination Camp helped to define the Nazi Holocaust.
In 1941 Cohen was imprisoned at Compiègne, where he founded a group called Massada supporting the creation of a Jewish state. In 1942 he was released, and he tried to keep in touch with the Vichy Government in order to accomplish his plan. At the beginning of 1944 he was arrested by the Gestapo and deported to Gleiwitz, one of many subcamps of Auschwitz, where he died in June 1944.[1]

Parti culinaire du Québec LeaderJean-Louis ThémisFounded2018 (2018)IdeologyCreation of a "Gastronocracy"Seats in the National Assembly0 / 125Websitehttp://www.particulinaireduquebec.org/Politics of QuebecPolitical partiesElections
The Parti culinaire du Québec is a minor provincial political party in Quebec, Canada.[1][2][3] Founded in 2018 by Madagascar-born Quebec chef Jean-Louis Thémis, it aims to educate Quebec voters about food and respect for nature.[1]


Background[edit]
Jean-Louis Thémis was born Jean-Louis Thémistocle Randriantiana in Madagascar in the 1950s, and moved to Quebec in 1972.[1] Thémis has held a variety of positions in Quebec, including former head of Metro-Richelieu, founder of Cuisiniers sans Frontières (which teaches cooking to low-income communities internationally), and most recently as a teacher at Institut de tourisme et d'hôtellerie du Québec.[1] He announced his retirement from the ITHQ to pursue this project.

Ideology[edit]
The keystone of the party's ideology involves the creation of a "gastronocracy", in which farmers and food producers would be viewed as the elites in society.[1] No government decisions would be made that would jeopardize Quebec's food supply, using the proposed Energy East pipeline as an example.[1][2]
Themis has called for an end to Sunday shopping so that families could eat together, improving food in hospitals and community health centers and the creation of a Ministry of Gastronomy.[1][2]
The party would like to see artisanal restaurants using local and organic ingredients exempted from Quebec Sales Tax.[2]

Election results[edit]
In the 2018 Quebec election, Themis was the party's only candidate, in his home riding of Laurier-Dorion. He received 169 votes, or 0.54% of the votes cast in the riding.[4]
In the subsequent 2022 election, the party presented two candidates. Thémis was the party's candidate in the riding of Gouin, where he received 199 votes, or 0.68% of votes cast in the riding. Amélie Villeneuve ran in Laurier-Dorion, where they received 157 votes, or 0.58% of the votes cast in the riding.[5]

Victor Capoul
Joseph Victor Amédée Capoul (27 February 1839 – 18 February 1924) was a French operatic lyric tenor with a  graceful singing style.[1][2]

Early life[edit]
Capoul was born in Toulouse on 27 February 1839.

Career[edit]
Victor Capoul began his studies in Toulouse. He was admitted to the Conservatoire de Paris in 1859, where, as a pupil of Révial (singing) and Mocker (opéra comique), he won a first prize for the latter in 1861.
He was engaged at the Opéra-Comique the same year and made his debut on 26 August as Daniel in Adolphe Adam's Le Chalet.[3] He sang other roles in the repertoire such as in La fille du régiment, La part du diable, La dame blanche, Le pré aux clercs and L'étoile du nord, until leaving in 1870. He also created the roles of Renaud in Lefébure-Wély's 1861 opera Les Recruteurs, Eustache in Les Absents by Ferdinand Poise on 26 October 1864, Horace in the two-act version of Gounod's opera La colombe on 7 June 1866, Le Marquis de Kerdrel in La grand'tante on 3 April 1867, Gaston de Maillepré in Le premier jour de bonheur on 15 February 1868, and Valentin/Vert-Vert in Offenbach's opéra comique Vert-Vert on 10 March 1869.[4]
On 1 July 1864, during a temporary closure of the Salle Favart, Capoul appeared with Balbi in The Barber of Seville at the Théâtre Porte-Saint-Martin. He took part in the performance of the prize cantata at the Conservatoire Renaud dans les jardins d'Armide, words by Camille du Locle, music by Charles Lenepveu on 4 January 1866.[4] In 1866 he was involved in a dispute between the Opéra-Comique and the Théâtre Lyrique, which was attempting to engage him—both for his voice and his looks—as Roméo in the premiere of Gounod's opera Roméo et Juliette, the part eventually going to Michot.[5] In the same year he saw success in the title role of Joseph at the Salle Favart.[4]

Capoul, [ca. 1859–1870]. Carte de Visite Collection, Boston Public Library
He was invited to London for a season in 1871 by Mapleson, appearing in Faust at Drury Lane and returned again until 1875; later from 1877 he was seen in Fra Diavolo at Covent Garden (which he had first sung at the Opéra-Comique in 1870), followed by Almaviva, Ernesto and Elvino.[1] After several tours around Europe, to Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Vienna, he returned to Paris, and appeared in the premieres of Les amants de Vérone at the Théâtre Ventadour, Paul et Virginie, at the Gaité; Saïs (by Marguerite Olagnier)[6] at the Théâtre de la Renaissance and Jocelyn at the Château d'Eau.
He took part in the concert given at the Trocadero on 8 June 1887, for a benefit for the victims of the recent fire at the Opéra-Comique.
In the US, he made his debut at the Academy of Music in 1871. Later, he appeared in the first season, that of 1883–84, at the New York Metropolitan Opera in Faust (title role), Mignon (Wilhelm Meister), La traviata (Alfredo) and Roméo et Juliette (Tybalt).
He collaborated on the libretto of Jocelyn, by Godard (première 25 February 1888 at La Monnaie, Brussels), and sang in the Paris premiere at the Théâtre du Chàteau-d'Eau on 13 October 1888. His one known recording is of an aria from this opera. It was made in Paris in 1905 for the Fonotipia Company and shows a voice past its prime. By this time Capoul was almost stone deaf. According to Scott however (Record of Singing: 1978) the mid-19th century style remains.
In 1899, Pedro Gailhard recruited him to become artistic director of the Opéra de Paris, of which establishment Gailhard was director. Capoul's later life was clouded by financial and other difficulties, and he died in reduced circumstances in Pujaudran, France on 18 February 1924.

The National Council of Women of Canada (NCWC, French: Conseil national des femmes du Canada (CNFC)) is a Canadian advocacy organization based in Ottawa, Ontario, aimed at improving conditions for women, families, and communities. A federation of nationally-organized societies of men and women and local and provincial councils of women, it is the Canadian member of the International Council of Women (ICW). The Council has concerned itself in areas including women's suffrage, immigration, health care, education, mass media, the environment, and many others.[1] Formed on October 27, 1893, in Toronto, Ontario, it is one of the oldest advocacy organizations in the country.[2] Lady Aberdeen was elected the first president of the National Council of Women of Canada in 1893. Prominent Council leaders included Lady Gzowski, Dr. Augusta Stowe-Gullen, and Adelaide Hoodless.[3]


Founding[edit]
The International Council of Women was founded in 1888 in Washington, D.C., United States. By May 1893, the IWC World's Congress of Representative Women had met in Chicago and discussed creating a Canadian Council. The Council formally began its existence on October 27 at a public meeting at the Horticultural Pavilion of the Allan Gardens in Toronto. Over 1,500 women attended the meeting, which was chaired by Lady Aberdeen, wife of then-Governor General John Campbell Hamilton-Gordon, 7th Earl of Aberdeen. Lady Aberdeen served as the Council's first president until her resignation in 1899; she was succeeded by Lady Taylor.[4]

Activities[edit]
The Council serves an advisory role on issues based on existing organization policy. New policies are proposed as resolutions, which are developed through grassroots discussions on the local and provincial scale and are then debated and voted upon. If they are accepted, they become policies. The organization then creates briefs (formal papers based on policy), which suggest a course of action and are submitted to an official body, such as a government.
The organization has sent representatives to government boards and international bodies such as the League of Nations. The Council played a key role in creating the Victorian Order of Nurses, the Children's Aid Society, and the Consumers' Association of Canada.[1] One of the first affiliate organizations was the Women's Art Association of Canada, of which Lady Aberdeen was the sponsor.[5][6] It has also played a role in developing the Women's Bureau of Labour Canada, the Federal Bureau on Ageing, and supported the call for the Royal Commission on the Status of Women, which created the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women.[2]
The Council's major cause 1894–1918 was its fight to upgrade the status of women, without seeking the vote.  It promoted a vision of "transcendent citizenship" for women. The ballot was not needed, for citizenship was to be exercised through personal influence and moral suasion, through the election of men with strong moral character, and through raising public-spirited sons. The National Council position was integrated into its nation-building program that sought to uphold Canada as a White settler nation. While the woman suffrage movement was important for extending the political rights of White women, it was also authorized through race-based arguments that linked White women's enfranchisement to the need to protect the nation from "racial degeneration."[7]
Between 1914 and 1921 the NCWC published the monthly journal Woman's Century.
The purpose was to educate women about public issues and the reforms that were needed, and to provide a forum for discussion by different women's groups.[8]
The title page described it as "A journal of education and progress for Canadian women."
The monthly journal was modeled on successful British and American feminist periodicals.[9]
It was one of the very few women's rights journals published in Canada.[10]
In 1918, the federal government granted women the right to vote in federal elections. In 1929, The Famous Five won Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), commonly known as the "Persons case", which determined that women were "persons". Three of The Five were active members of the NCWC,[4] and the NCWC played a vital role in winning the case.[2]
Other causes include child welfare measures such as preventing child abuse, and encouraging education and good health care. General health measures include pasteurization, clean water, and medical inspections in schools. The Council has also fought controversial battles, such as broadening the grounds for divorce, wider availability of birth control information, removing abortion from the Criminal Code, and programs to protect and rehabilitate prostitutes.[4]
The organization holds Consultative Status (II) with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[2]

Notable members[edit]
W.L. Mackenzie King unveiled a plaque from the Canadian Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs[11] honouring The Famous Five (1938, Nellie McClung at front right).
Several members of the Council have played prominent roles in Canadian history. Lady Aberdeen was instrumental in forming the Canadian branch of the National Council of Women. She had the first idea of creating the organization, despite other statements. Augusta Stowe-Gullen, one of the Society's co-founding members, was the first woman to earn a medical degree in Canada and was an important figure in the women's suffrage movement.[2]
Matilda Ridout Edgar (1844–1910), later Lady Edgar, was president in 1906 and 1909. She was an accomplished historian and an influential feminist.[12]
President Winnifred Kydd was a delegate to the League of Nations. In 1930 Cairine Wilson of the Ottawa Council became the first woman to be appointed to the Senate.[2] Each of The Famous Five (Emily Murphy, Irene Parlby, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, Henrietta Edwards) were members in the organization.[13] and also Edith Archibald led the organization for a bit in the 1880s.

Local government in Malaysia,[1] according to Local Government Act 1971 of Malaysia, means city councils, municipal councils and district councils.


City council[edit]
See also: List of cities in Malaysia
Local governments administering a city are normally called City Council (Majlis Bandaraya). However, there are local authorities which are called City Hall (Dewan Bandaraya). The usage of the term "city hall" is a possible misnomer since a city hall normally refers to the building which houses a city council instead of the local council itself.
Kuantan City Council, having received city status on 21 February 2021, is the newest City Council formed in Malaysia following Klang City Council which received city status on 5 February 2024.[2][3]

Seventeen Again is an American fantasy–comedy film. It first aired on Showtime on November 12, 2000, and was released on DVD on April 9, 2002. The film was also included as a bonus feature on the Sister, Sister (which ended in May 1999) Complete Collection box set released in March 2016. Directed by Jeffrey W. Byrd, it stars Tia Mowry & Tamera Mowry, and their younger brother Tahj Mowry.[1]


Plot[edit]
When the Donovan family moves from California to Connecticut, 17-year-old Sydney (Tia Mowry) finds it is not easy being in a new town away from her old friends and adjusting to her father's remarriage after her mother died some time ago. However, while working at her new job, she encounters Todd (Merwin Mondesir), a boy in her class, whom she has a crush on. However, Ashley (Maia Campbell), his older sister, dislikes her and criticizes her any way she can. Her 12-year-old genius brother Willie (Tahj Mowry) is happy as long as he can tinker in his lab with his increasingly complex experiments. When another experiment goes wrong, their father, Barry (Phillip Jarrett), forbids him from making more experiments in his lab until he learns responsibility. Willie is convinced he can defeat the aging process, and while devising an experimental anti-aging formula, he accidentally spills some on a box of soap.
When their grandmother Cat (Hope Clarke) unknowingly uses the tainted soap, she is transformed into a 17-year-old (Tamera Mowry). Her ex-husband Gene (Robert Hooks) follows suit, and is also returned to his teenaged self (Mark Taylor).
Cat and Gene are having a fine time reliving their youth and enjoying the thrill of teenage romance, but there's an error in the ointment. Willie learns his formula could have deadly side effects, and now he must discover an antidote to return his grandparents to their older but healthy bodies. Through their experience as teenagers again Gene and Cat realize they are still in love with each other but Cat is reluctant to believe Gene's feelings are genuine as she is still heartbroken that he chose to leave her for a job in Australia 20 years ago, hence the reason for their divorce.
In Sydney's room, she and Cat finally have a long and heartfelt talk. Sydney admits she's homesick for California and her old friends. She hates Connecticut and the bullying she is subjected to by Ashley and her friends because Todd is interested in her. During that time, Cat admits her earlier experience with Ashley. However unlike Sydney, she was able to stand up to Ashley and earn her begrudging respect. Meanwhile, Gene who has had time to reflect on his life choices, realizes his mistake of leaving his family, and bids farewell to his life as a teenager and the friends he has made, and goes to the dance with Ashley in hopes of reconciling with Cat.
Meanwhile, at the dance, Sydney and Cat arrive and find Gene with Ashley. Gene and Cat share a dance where they reconcile, before Cat passes out due to the side effects of the transformation. Willie arrives with the antidote as Gene carries Cat to the school's pool. Ashley, furious that Gene ditched her for Cat, cuts them off before they can save her. Sydney, having had enough of Ashley and her bullying, punches her in the face. As she and Willie leave to save their grandparents, everyone applauds Sydney for giving Ashley what she deserved. Willie tosses the antidote in the pool and Gene and Cat jump in. Gene asks Cat to marry him again after their crazy experience. Cat says yes, but then the happiness is interrupted by Sydney and Willie's dad, Barry and step-mother, Monique (Tonya Lee Williams) coming home from a trip. The parents are surprised to see Cat and Gene reconciled and Monique tells him that they should let them babysit next time. Sydney asks Monique if she could help with the wedding plans and she agrees. A call comes in and Willie calls for Barry, who tells him that he's in the shower (with the soap, which they forgot to get rid of). Of course, Sydney and Willie now have to stop their father from using the soap.
