Residential care refers to long-term care given to adults or children who stay in a residential setting rather than in their own home or family home.
There are various residential care options available, depending on the needs of the individual. People with disabilities, mental health problems, Intellectual disability, Alzheimer's disease, dementia or who are frail aged are often cared for at home by paid or voluntary caregivers, such as family and friends, with additional support from home care agencies. However, if home-based care is not available or not appropriate for the individual, residential care may be required.


Child care[edit]
Children may be removed from abusive or unfit homes by government action, or they may be placed in various types of out-of-home care by parents who are unable to care for them or their special needs. In most jurisdictions the child is removed from the home only as a last resort, for their own safety and well-being or the safety or others, since out-of-home care is regarded as very disruptive to the child. They are moved to a place called a foster home.[1]

Residential schools[edit]
A residential school is a school in which children generally stay 24 hours per day, 7 days per week (often called a boarding school).  There is divided opinion about whether this type of schooling is beneficial for children.  A case for residential special schooling has been advanced in the article: Residential special schooling: the inclusive option! in the Scottish Journal of Residential Child Care, Volume 3(2), 17–32, 2004 by Robin Jackson.[2]

Residential child care[edit]
This type of out-of-home care is for orphans, or for children whose parents cannot or will not look after them. Orphaned, abandoned or high risk young people may live in small self-contained units established as home environments, for example within residential child care communities. Young people in this care are, if removed from home involuntarily, subject to government departmental evaluations that include progressions within health, education, social presentations, family networks and others. These are referred to as life domains within the charter of Looking after Children (LAC). Recent trends have favored placement of children in foster care rather than residential settings, partially for financial reasons, but a 1998 survey found that a majority of out-of-home children surveyed preferred residential or group homes over foster care.[2]

Child disability care[edit]
Children may be placed or taken into care because they have a mental, developmental, or physical disability, often referred to as "special needs."  A team of teachers, therapists, and caregivers look after the children, who may or may not go home to their parents at night or on weekends. Conditions and disabilities such as Autism, Down syndrome, epilepsy and cerebral palsy (to name a few) may require that children receive residential professional care. Specialized residential can be provided for children with conditions such as anorexia, bulimia, schizophrenia, addiction, or children who are practicing self-harm.

Foster care[edit]
Children, including children with special needs, may be cared for in a licensed foster care home. Foster care entails the young person or young people going to live with a family that is not biologically related to the young persons/people. Special training or special facilities may be required to foster a child who is medically fragile - for example, a child who has a serious medical condition or is dependent on medical technology such as oxygen support.[3]

Adult care[edit]
Adult disability care[edit]
Adults may take a place in an adult residential facility because of a disability, often a mental disability such as Down syndrome or Autism, which can make them unable to care for their daily needs.[4]

Geriatric care[edit]
Various forms of long-term residential care are available for elderly people. A person or couple who are able to take care of their daily needs may choose to live in a retirement apartment complex ("independent living") where they function autonomously. They may choose to fix their own meals or have meals provided, or some combination of both.
Many residential facilities are designed for elderly people who do not need 24-hour nursing care but are unable to live independently. Such facilities may be described as assisted living facilities, board and care homes, or rest homes. They typically provide a furnished or unfurnished room, together with all meals and housekeeping and laundry service. Depending on the needs of the resident they also provide assistance with daily activities such as personal hygiene, dressing, eating, and walking. They are not considered to be medical facilities, but they do have to meet state standards for care and safety.[5]
Nursing homes, also known as rest homes or skilled nursing facilities, are intended for people who need ongoing medical care as well as help with daily activities. Nursing home populations have been decreasing in the United States, despite the increase in the elderly population, because of the increasing availability of other options such as assisted living.[6]
Continuing care retirement communities provide several types of care - typically independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing - in one location, with the resident being able to move from one level of to another as their needs dictate.[7] This is often referred to as 'Aging in Place'.

Hospice care[edit]
Hospices provide a form of medical care for people with a terminal illness or condition, for example, cancer. It is generally used when a person is very close to death. Most hospices offer a choice of residential (nursing home) or in-home (supportive) care. A hospice emphasizes a palliative rather than curative approach; the patient is made comfortable, including pain relief as needed, and both patient and family are given emotional, spiritual, and practical support.[8]

Mental illness[edit]
Psychiatric hospital care[edit]
People may be detained under the laws that state that they have to be sectioned in certain circumstances.  In the United Kingdom, at least 2 doctors can sign a paper to get this to happen. Patients have to be a risk to themselves, property or other people to warrant being sectioned; this can include suicide attempts.
Some patients may volunteer to go to a psychiatric hospital because they recognize that they are ill.
Treatment can occur against the patient's wishes if this is needed and that can be with the use of drugs. The patients are generally detained until doctors believe that they are stable enough to leave.

Rehabilitation unit care[edit]
People who are addicted to drugs or alcohol may be voluntarily or involuntarily admitted to a residential rehabilitation facility for treatment. Prescribed drugs are sometimes used to get people off illegal or addictive drugs, and to prevent the withdrawal symptoms of such drugs. The length of stay may be determined by the patient's needs or by external factors. In many cases the patient's insurance will cover such treatment in private facilities for only a limited period of time, and public rehabilitation facilities often have long waiting lists.[9]

Levels of care[edit]
Total care[edit]
Main article: Total care
Total care is when a resident or patient requires a caregiver in order to have all their survival needs met, including ambulation, respiration, bathing, dressing, feeding, and toileting.
The term "total care" is sometimes incorrectly used in nursing homes and other similar facilities to refer to a patient who simply needs diaper changes, but is able to provide other care on his/her own.

Self care[edit]
The term "self care" is used to refer to a resident or patient who resides in a caregiving facility, but is able to meet one's own needs, such as ambulation and toileting, and only requires a caregiver for occasional assistance.

The Blood Mountain Wilderness was designated in 1991 and currently consists of 7,800 acres (32 km2). The Wilderness is located within the borders of the Chattahoochee National Forest in Lumpkin County and Union County, Georgia.  The Wilderness is managed by the United States Forest Service and is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System.  In November, 1999, three fires burned through parts of the Blood Mountain Wilderness and the Chattahoochee National Forest.  Fire crews came from across the nation to help fight the fires.
The highest elevation in the Blood Mountain Wilderness is the 4,458-foot (1,359 m) peak of Blood Mountain.  The Wilderness includes 10.75 miles (17.30 km) of the Appalachian Trail, which may be the most heavily used portion of the AT.  The Blood Mountain Wilderness is the first wilderness encountered on the AT after its starting point on Springer Mountain.
Due to conflicts with black bears, in 2012 the Forest Service implemented a seasonal requirement for all overnight campers to carry bear-resistant canisters.  The requirement goes into effect every year, from March 1 to June 1, and it encompasses all areas within quarter mile of the AT, from Jarrard Gap to Neels Gap.[1]

Boi Volkert Faltings (born April 10, 1960) is a Swiss professor of artificial intelligence at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.[1]


Education[edit]
Faltings was born in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, and he received a diploma with distinction from ETH Zurich in 1983, where he studied electrical engineering with James Massey. He obtained a Ph.D. degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1987 under the supervision of Ken Forbus. His thesis was entitled "Qualitative kinematics in mechanisms" and showed for the first time how to derive kinematic interactions from object shapes.

Work[edit]
Faltings is noted for work in artificial intelligence, especially in qualitative reasoning about mechanisms, case-based reasoning in design, constraint satisfaction in design and logistics, and intelligent user interfaces.[2] His recent work has centered on multi-agent systems, in particular the DPOP family of algorithms for distributed constraint optimization, the blocking island abstraction technique for network routing, and game-theoretic techniques for eliciting truthful information, in particular the peer truth serum.[3][4]
In 1997,  Faltings co-founded the company Iconomic Systems, known for development of  an agent-based paradigm for travel e-commerce.[5] He subsequently co-founded 5 other  companies. Among them, in 2004 he co-founded NexThink, providing network security and data analytics. In 2007, he co-founded Prediggo, a company that provides  recommender systems.[6]
Faltings was nominated professor at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in 1987 and promoted to full professor in 1993. He founded the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and served as head for the Department of Computer Science. He has spent 6 months each as visiting professor at Stanford University and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. He has served as associate editor for numerous journals, including the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, the Artificial Intelligence, the ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, the ACM Transactions on Economics and Computation, and the ACM Transactions on Social Computing. He was president of the Swiss Group for Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science from 1995 to 2014,[7] and member of the executive council of the Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligence from 2014 to 2017.

Honors[edit]
In 1983, Faltings received the silver medal of the ETH Zurich for his diploma thesis. In 1984, he received an IBM graduate fellowship. In 2000, he received a distinguished service award from IFIP. In 2002, he was elected a Fellow of the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence,[8]  and in  2012, he was elected a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.[9]

Career highlights and awards
National League pennant (1900)

Frank R. Kitson (September 11, 1869 – April 14, 1930) was an American baseball pitcher.
A native of Michigan, Kitson played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Baltimore Orioles (1898–1899), Brooklyn Superbas (1900–1902), Detroit Tigers (1903–1905), Washington Senators (1906–1907), and New York Highlanders (1907).
Kitson helped lead the 1900 Brooklyn Superbas to the National League pennant. He had 22 wins in 1899 and won at least 15 games five consecutive years from 1899 to 1903.  He compiled a career record of 128–117 with a 3.18 earned run average (ERA) and 729 strikeouts. He appeared in 304 games and threw 211 complete games.[1]


Early years[edit]
Kitson was born in 1869 at Hopkins, Michigan.[1]

Professional baseball player[edit]
Minor leagues[edit]
The first record of Kitson's professional baseball career is in 1895 when he played for the Grand Rapids Gold Bugs in the Western League. He played in the Virginia League in 1896 and then in 1897 for the Burlington Colts of the Western Association. He compiled a 14–17 record for Burlington.[2]

Baltimore and Brooklyn[edit]
In August 1897, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Kitson from Burlington.[3] Ned Hanlon, manager of the Orioles, later recalled that he arranged the purchase of Kitson without having seen him. Interviewed in 1900, Hanlon recalled: "I'll never take another man without first seeing him work. It took over a year to teach Kitson to earn the $500 that we gave for him, but it cost me enough worry to last a lifetime. He is now one of the best pitchers in the league, but when I got him he couldn't pitch a little bit, and as for fielding his position, that was out of the question."[4]
Kitson's major league career got off to a roller coaster start in Baltimore. In his first start on May 19, 1898, he shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates.  Six days later, the Cubs scored 20 runs off him; the game was called after seven innings with the Cubs ahead 20–4. In his second season in Baltimore, Kitson appeared in 40 games and compiled a 22-16 record in 326+2⁄3 innings pitched.[1] He ranked among the National League leaders with a 2.77 ERA (sixth), 22 wins (10th), and 34 complete games (10th).[1] Kitson also contributed with a .314 batting average, three triples, and 16 RBIs.[1]
The Orioles folded after the 1899 season, and a number of players, including Kitson, were transferred the Brooklyn Superbas.[5] He was a key player for the 1900 Brooklyn team that compiled an 82-54 to win the National League pennant. He appeared in 40 games in 1900, compiling a 15-13 record with a 4.19 ERA in 253 innings pitched.[1]  He also helped his cause with a .294 batting average.[1]
He improved in 1901, compiling a 19-11 record with a 2.98 ERA in 38 games pitched. He also led the National League with four saves.[1] On July 25, he pitched a one-hitter against Christy Mathewson and the New York Giants, and The Brookly Daily Eagle reported that Kitson's "speed, curves and command was perfect and the Giants were helpless in his hands."[6]
In 1902, Kitson again won 19 games for Brooklyn, compiling a 19-13 record with a 2.85 ERA in 32 games pitched. He ranked among the National League's leaders with 19 wins (eighth), 109 strikeouts (ninth), and 29 complete games (10th).[1]

Detroit Tigers[edit]
On October 25, 1902, he left Brooklyn to sign with the Detroit Tigers in the American League. In his first season in Detroit, he compiled a 15-16 record with a career-best 2.58 ERA. He remained with the Tigers for two more seasons, compiling a 9-13 record, 3.07 ERA in 1904, and a 12-14 record, 3.47 ERA in 1905.[1]

Washington and New York[edit]
On December 5, 1905, the Tigers traded Kitson to the Washington Senators in exchange for Happy Townsend. He compiled a 6-14	record and 3.65 for the Senators in 1906. He began the 1907 with the Senators and lost his first three decisions with a 3.94 ERA.[1]
On May 30, 1907, the Senators sold Kitson to the New York Highlanders. He compiled a 4-0 record for the Highlanders with a 3.00 ERA.  He pitched his final major league game on July 22, 1907.[1]
In 249 major league games, Kitson posted a 128–117 record with a 3.18 ERA. He also compiled a respectable .240 batting average (235-for-979) with 4 home runs and 95 RBI.[1]

Later years[edit]
Kitson died in April 1930 at his farm located two-and-a-half miles north of Allegan, Michigan. He had been suffering from a heart ailment for several years before his death.[7] He was interred in Hudson Corners Cemetery.[1]

Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677 (2004), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, or FSIA, applies retroactively to acts prior to its enactment in 1976.[1]


Decision[edit]
The case turned on the "anti-retroactivity doctrine", which is a doctrine that holds that courts should not construe a statute to apply retroactively (to apply to situations that arose before it was enacted) unless there is a clear statutory intent that it should do so. This means that, regarding lawsuits filed after its enactment, the FSIA standards of sovereign immunity and its exceptions apply even to conduct that took place before 1976. Since the intent of FSIA was the codification of already existing well settled standards of international law, Austria was deemed not immune from litigation, for acts that first arose from criminal conduct during World War II.
The result of this case for the plaintiff, Maria Altmann, was that she was authorized to proceed with a civil action against Austria in a U.S. federal district court for recovery of five paintings stolen by the Nazis from her relatives and then housed in an Austrian government museum.  As the Supreme Court noted in its decision, Altmann had already tried suing the museum before in Austria, but was forced to voluntarily dismiss her case because of Austria's rule that court costs are proportional to the amount in controversy (in this case, the enormous monetary value of the paintings).  Under Austrian law, the filing fee for such a lawsuit is determined as a percentage of the recoverable amount. At the time, the five paintings were estimated to be worth approximately US$135 million, making the filing fee over US$1.5 million. Although the Austrian courts later reduced this amount to $350,000, this was still too much for Altmann, and she dropped her case in the Austrian court system.  
The high court remanded the case for trial in the Los Angeles district court.  Back in the district court, both parties agreed to arbitration in Austria in 2005, which in turn ruled in favor of Altmann on 16 January 2006.

Case[edit]
Adele Bloch-Bauer, the subject of two of the paintings, had written in her last will: "Meine 2 Porträts und 4 Landschaften von Gustav Klimt, bitte ich meinen Ehegatten nach seinem Tode der österr. Staats-Galerie in Wien zu hinterlassen"; that is, "I ask my husband to bequeath my 2 portraits and the 4 landscapes by Gustav Klimt to the Austrian State Gallery in Vienna after his death." Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer signed a statement acknowledging Adele's wish in her last will. He also donated one of the landscape paintings to the Belvedere Gallery in Vienna in 1936.[2] The Austrian arbitration determined that Adele was probably never the legal owner of the paintings. Rather, it viewed it as more likely that Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer was their legal owner and that in turn his heirs, including Altmann, were the rightful owners.

The ruling in favor of Maria Altmann came as a great shock to the Austrian public and the government.[citation needed] The loss of the paintings was regarded in Austria as a loss of national treasure.[3] She had attempted earlier to come to some mutual agreement in 1999; however, the government repeatedly ignored her proposals.[3] Maria Altmann told the government that the time was up and there would be no deal from her side anymore.[citation needed] The Austrian government declined to accept a condition of the arbitration which would have allowed it preferentially to purchase the paintings at an attested market price.[citation needed] The paintings left Austria in March 2006 and were returned to Altmann.[3]  Consequently, the Austrian government received criticism from the opposition parties for its failure to secure a deal with Altmann at an earlier stage.[3]  The city of Vienna also asserted that buying back the paintings was a "moral duty".[3]
Just months after the Austrian government finally returned Ms. Altmann's family's heirlooms to her, she consigned the Klimts to the auction house Christie's, to be sold on her behalf. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I sold for allegedly $135 million in a private sale, the others in auction, e.g. Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II for $88 million, with the five paintings fetching a total of over $327 million.[4]

Documentaries[edit]
Maria Altmann's story has been recounted in three documentary films. Stealing Klimt, which was released in 2007, featured interviews with Altmann and others who were closely involved with the story. Adele's Wish[5] by filmmaker Terrence Turner, who is the husband of Altmann's great-niece, was released in 2008, and features interviews with Altmann, her lawyer, E. Randol Schoenberg, and leading experts from around the world. The piece was also featured in the 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa, which dealt with the massive theft of art in Europe by the Nazi Government during World War II.

Dramatization[edit]
Further information: Woman in Gold (film)
Altmann is portrayed by Helen Mirren, and Schoenberg by Ryan Reynolds in the film Woman in Gold, chronicling Altmann's nearly decade-long struggle to recover the Klimt paintings. The film was released on April 3, 2015.

The nation building in the early 1900s
The meeting and banquet hall of the nation in the 1880s
Stockholms nation is a student society and one of thirteen nations at Uppsala University. The nation has its origins in the mid-17th century and regards 1649 as its official date of foundation, although this is uncertain. A document in the archives mentions students enrolled in the nation in 1649, but this is a copy of an original that was lost in a fire in 1702, and the nation is mentioned in the protocols of the consistory (board) of the university from 1656 as having been in existence for three years, which would put the foundation date at about 1653.[1]
The old part of the nation building was designed by architect Johan Fredrik Åbom, and was completed in 1848. A new wing of the nation building, begun in 1961, is designed by modernist architect Peter Celsing.[2]
Former curators (chairmen) of the nation include the mathematician Gösta Mittag-Leffler, the economist Knut Wicksell and the author Gösta Knutsson. The songwriter Carl Michael Bellman was enrolled in Stockholms nation during his brief period as a student in Uppsala (1758–1759).[3]

Isabella BirdFRSGS FRGSBornIsabella Lucy Bird(1831-10-15)15 October 1831Boroughbridge, YorkshireDied7 October 1904(1904-10-07) (aged 72)Edinburgh, ScotlandResting placeDean Cemetery, EdinburghOccupation(s)Writer, photographer and naturalistSpouseJohn Bishop (m. 1881)Parent(s)Dora Lawson, Edward Bird
Isabella Lucy Bishop FRGS (née Bird; 15 October 1831 – 7 October 1904) was an English explorer, writer, photographer and naturalist.[1][2][3] Alongside fellow Englishwoman Fanny Jane Butler, she founded the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in Srinagar in modern-day Kashmir.[4] She was also the first woman to be elected as a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.[5]


Early life[edit]
Bird was born on 15 October 1831 in Boroughbridge Hall, Yorkshire, the home of her maternal grandmother and her father's first curacy after taking orders in 1821. Her parents were Rev Edward Bird (1793-1858)- younger brother of the civil servant Robert Merttins Bird- and his second wife, Dora Lawson (1803–1866).[1] Her paternal grandparents were cousins; Robert Bird, of Taplow, Buckinghamshire, married Lucy Wilberforce Bird, daughter of silk merchant John Bird, of Coventry; Lucy's brother, the politician William Wilberforce Bird, married Robert Bird's sister, Elizabeth. Lucy's mother was the aunt of the philanthropist and slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce. The Bird family had established the silk trade at Coventry in the late 1600s, and were themselves silk masters.[6][7][8]
Bird lived in several places during her childhood. In 1832, Reverend Bird was appointed curate in Maidenhead. Because of her father's ill health, Bird's family moved again in 1834 to Tattenhall[9] in Cheshire, a living presented to him by his cousin Dr John Bird Sumner, Bishop of Chester, where in the same year Bird's sister, Henrietta, was born.
Bird was outspoken from an early age. When six years old, she confronted the local MP for South Cheshire, Sir Malpas de Grey Tatton Egerton, while he was campaigning, asking him "did you tell my father my sister was so pretty because you wanted his vote?"[10]
Edward Bird's controversial views against Sunday labour caused his congregation to dwindle, and in 1842 he requested a transfer to St. Thomas's in Birmingham. Here again, objections were raised, which culminated in the minister being pelted "with stones, mud, and insults".
In 1848, the family moved again and, after spending some time in Eastbourne, took up residence in Wyton in Huntingdonshire (now Cambridgeshire.)[10]
From early childhood, Bird was frail, suffering from a spinal complaint, nervous headaches, and insomnia. The doctor recommended an open-air life,[1] and consequently, Bird learned to ride in infancy, and later to row. Her only education came from her parents: her father was a keen botanist who instructed Bird in flora, and her mother taught her daughters an eclectic mix of subjects. Bird became an avid reader.[10] However, her "bright intelligence, [and] an extreme curiosity as to the world outside, made it impossible for her brain and her nature generally to be narrowed and stiffened by the strictly evangelical atmosphere of her childhood".[11]
Isabella's first publication at the age of 16 was a pamphlet addressing free trade versus protectionism, after which she continued writing articles for various periodicals.[5]
In 1850, a "fibrous tumour was removed from the neighbourhood of the spine". Bird continued to suffer from unspecified ailments resulting in lassitude and insomnia. The family spent six summers in Scotland in an effort to improve her health.
Doctors urged a sea voyage and in 1854, Bird's life of travelling began when the opportunity arose for her to sail to the United States, accompanying her second cousins to their family home. Her father "gave her [£]100 and leave to stay away as long as it lasted".[10] Bird's "bright descriptive letters"[5] written home to her relations formed the basis for her first book, An Englishwoman in America (1856),[12] published by Murray. John Murray, "as well as being Isabella's lifelong publisher, ... [became] one of her closest friends".[13]

Travels in middle life[edit]
Isabella Bird wearing Manchurian clothing from a journey through China. Bird left Britain again in 1872, going initially to Australia, which she disliked, and then to Hawaii (known in Europe as the Sandwich Islands), her love for which prompted her second book (published three years later). While there she climbed Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa.[14] She then moved on to Colorado, where she had heard the air was excellent for the infirm. Dressed practically and riding not sidesaddle but frontwards like a man (though she threatened to sue the Times for saying she dressed like one), she covered over 800 miles in the Rocky Mountains in 1873. Her letters to her sister, first printed in the magazine The Leisure Hour,[14] comprised Bird's fourth and perhaps most famous book, A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains.
Bird's time in the Rockies was enlivened especially by her acquaintance with Jim Nugent, "Rocky Mountain Jim", a textbook outlaw with one eye and an affinity for violence and poetry. "A man any woman might love but no sane woman would marry", Bird declared in a section excised from her letters before their publication.[citation needed] Nugent also seemed captivated by the independent-minded Bird, but she ultimately left the Rockies and her "dear desperado". Nugent was shot dead less than a year later.

At home, Bird again found herself pursued, this time by Dr John Bishop, an Edinburgh surgeon in his thirties. She got interested in Japan through John Francis Campbell's "My Circular Notes, 1876", and asked the advice of Colin Alexander McVean, former chief surveyor of Japan's Survey Office, in February 1878, then went travelling again, this time to Asia: Japan, China, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and Malaya. When her sister Henrietta Amelia Bird died of typhoid in 1880, Bird accepted John Bishop's marriage proposal. They were married in February 1881, and later that year she was awarded the Royal Order of Kapiolani by King Kalākaua of Hawaii.[1] Bird's health took a severe turn for the worse but, other than a spell of scarlet fever in 1888, it recovered following John Bishop's death in 1886, at which point she inherited a large amount of disposable income. Feeling that her earlier travels had been hopelessly dilettante, Bird studied medicine and resolved to travel as a missionary. Despite being nearly 60 years of age, she set off for India.[citation needed]

Later life[edit]
Korea and Her Neighbours (1898)
Arriving on the subcontinent in February 1889, Bird visited missions in India, visited Ladakh on the borders of Tibet, and then travelled in Persia, Kurdistan, and Turkey. In India, the Maharajah of Kashmir gave her a piece of land on which to build a hospital with sixty beds and a dispensary for women; there she worked with Fanny Jane Butler to found the John Bishop Memorial Hospital in memory of her recently deceased husband who had left funds for this purpose in his will. The following year, she joined a group of British soldiers travelling between Baghdad and Tehran. She remained with the unit's commanding officer during his survey work in the region, armed with her revolver and a medicine chest supplied – in possibly an early example of corporate sponsorship – by Henry Wellcome's company in London.[citation needed] In 1891, she travelled through Baluchistan to Persia and Armenia, exploring the source of the Karun River and later that year, she gave a speech in a committee room of the House of Commons on the persecution of Christians in Kurdistan, on which she had made representations to the Grand Vizier of the Turkish Empire.
Like most other European explorers of her generation, Bird employed large labour forces that did much of the work of transporting her. For instance, in China, she was carried 1,200 miles across the country by a changing group of Chinese men.[15]
Featured in journals and magazines for decades, Bird had, by then, become a household name. In 1890, she became the first woman to be awarded Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. Two years later, she became the first woman allowed to join the Royal Geographical Society.[16] She was elected to membership of the Royal Photographic Society on 12 January 1897. Her final great journey took place in 1897, when she travelled up the Yangtze and Han rivers in China and Korea, respectively. Later still, she went to Morocco, where she travelled among the Berbers and had to use a ladder to mount her black stallion, a gift from the Sultan.[14]

Death[edit]
A few months after returning from a trip to Morocco, Bird fell ill and died at her home on 16 Melville Street,[17] Edinburgh on 7 October 1904. She was buried with her family in Dean Cemetery in the west of the city. The grave lies in the small curved southern section, near the small path which divides it in two. She was planning another trip to China at the time of her death.

Legacy[edit]
Clock tower in Tobermory built with funds donated by Isabella Lucy Bird
The first biography of Bird was written by Anne M Stoddart and published in 1907.
Caryl Churchill used Bird as a character in her play Top Girls (1982). Much of the dialogue written by Churchill comes from Bird's own writings.
Bird was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1985.[18]
Bird was featured in Bedrock: Writers on the Wonders of Geology (2006), edited by Lauret E. Savoy, Eldridge M. Moores, and Judith E. Moores (Trinity University Press) which looks at writing over the years and how it pays tribute to the Earth and its geological features.[19]
Bird is also the main character of the manga Isabella Bird in Wonderland (Fushigi no Kuni no Bird), a novelization of her travels to Japan; it received a bilingual Japanese-English edition beginning in 2018.[20]
The building of the clock tower on Tobermory, Mull harbour wall was funded by Bird in memory of her beloved sister Henrietta. It was designed by mountaineer and explorer Edward Whymper.[10]
In December 2022, BBC Two broadcast a television programme dedicated to Isabella called Trailblazers: A Rocky Mountain Road Trip presented by Ruby Wax who undertook a road trip to retrace her steps in Colorado with Mel B and Emily Atack.[21]
A promotional tourism event held in Kaneyama in July 2023 celebrated Bird's travels through Japan by "retracing Bird's actual route along the Ushu Kaido road near the Uwadai mountain pass."[22]

Xiahe County (Chinese: 夏河县; Tibetan: བསང་ཆུ་རྫོང་།) is a county in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu province, China, bordering Qinghai province to the west. The name (both Chinese and Tibetan), which literally means "Xia River", refers to the Daxia River which runs through the county. It is home to the famed Labrang Tibetan Buddhist monastery, one of the largest Tibetan Buddhist monasteries outside the Tibet Autonomous Region. The town is populated largely by ethnic Tibetans, as well as some Hui and Han Chinese. The area is highly rural and pastoral (including yak and other animal rearing). The geography is mountainous. In recent years it has become a tourist attraction. The county was named Xiahe in 1928, after the Daxia River that flows through its territory.

History[edit]
Xiahe (Sangqu) used to be part of Qinghai when it was under the control of Chinese Muslim General Ma Qi.[2] It was the site of bloody battles between Muslim and Tibetan forces.[3][4][5]
In 1980, Xiahe mandible, a hominin fossil jaw, was discovered in Baishiya Karst Cave, Xiahe County.

Location[edit]
Xiahe (Sangqu) is found in the southern portion of Gansu province, along the western border with Qinghai province. It lies along the Daxia and Zhao rivers. It is on the northeast edge of the Tibetan Plateau. The average elevation is 2,900 to 3,100 m (9,500 to 10,200 ft) with the highest being 4,636 m (15,210 ft) and the lowest 2,160 m (7,087 ft).

Climate[edit]
Xiahe County has an alpine subarctic climate (Köppen Dwc) that grades into an alpine climate (ETH) at the highest elevations. The climate is characterised by mild, rainy summers and frigid, but dry and sunny, winters.

James Henry Aldridge (4 July 1849 – 11 November 1929) was a horse breeder and hotelier in South Australia. He founded the Richmond Park Stud in the Adelaide suburb of Richmond.
J. H. Aldridge, as he was generally known, or "Jim" to his friends, was born at Kensington, South Australia, the son of George Aldridge (c. 1817 – 12 December 1879), who emigrated to South Australia in 1847.  Before the advent of the Adelaide Town Hall there were three city venues for public functions: Neale's Rooms, White's Rooms and Aldridge's Rooms, all on King William Street. Aldridge's Rooms, which appears in newspaper advertisements between 1860 and 1863, was mentioned as a strong argument against the building of a Town Hall.[1] It is probable that this venue became the Prince Alfred Hotel (alongside the Town Hall), which George Aldridge opened in 1869, and remained its proprietor.[2][3]
Aldridge was educated at St. Peter's College, and immediately after leaving school joined G. W. Goyder's party surveying the Northern Territory. On his return to the city, he joined the telegraph party working in the Roper River area. He then drove a herd of bullocks to the Northern Territory diggings, and sold them for a good profit. In 1879 he purchased from William Blackler the publican's licence to the Globe Hotel (the popular resort of sportsmen, and home of the Tattersalls Club, of which he remained a member) in Rundle Street and managed it for nine years.[4] He left the "Globe" to become first licensee of the Grand Hotel, Broken Hill 1888–1893 in the midst of a mining boom. To escape the smelter's fumes he built a home and farm between Thorndale and the aerodrome.[5] Then from 1898 to around 1907 he was the lessee of the newly rebuilt Gresham Hotel 1–9 King William Street, Adelaide.


Horse Racing[edit]
In 1890 Aldridge, who was a keen follower of the turf, decided to establish a stud farm. He purchased the Sydney stallion Carlyon for 1,000 guineas, and a dozen brood mares, including Brown Alice, Queensdale, Tuberose, Thora, Atholine, Queen of Nations, and Sylvan Queen. He secured a property "Richmond Park" off Richmond Road, South Australia, later to become part of West Beach Airport, and quickly made a name for himself as a breeder, and Carlyon soon won fame as a sire, for a time topping the winning sires' list in South Australia. Among his progeny were St. David, Carlton, winner of a Newmarket Handicap, Gunga Din (Adelaide Cup), Antilles (City Handicap and Birthday Cup), Lord Carlyon (Goodwood Handicap), Dirk Hammerhand (S.A. St. Leger), Troubridge (Fulham Park Plate), St. Vincent and Aline (Fulham Park Plate), Rienzi (S.A. Derby), Bay Lavender (A.R.C. Grand National Hurdles).[6]
In 1905 Carlyon was severely injured, and although still fit to do duty, Aldridge procured another sire, Pistol (a son of Carbine), from England. His foals were good looking, and they topped the market.[6] Like the Carlyons, the Pistols proved their worth on the race course, and after successful careers on the flat won an A.E.C. Grand National Steeplechase, two local Grand National Steeplechases, three Grand National Hurdles, one V.R.C. Grand National Hurdles, one V.R.C. Grand National Steeplechase, and two Australian Hurdles.[7]
Aldridge next purchased St. Anton, a crack sprinter, from England. His stock won over all distances on the flat, and have proved themselves jumpers of no mean order. His next import from England was Lucknow, whose stock were also successful racers.[6]
A report that "Richmond Park" was named for the great horse Richmond owned by Eli Jellett (c. 1835–1911) and subsequently by Aldridge, and the origin of the suburb of Richmond[8] is fanciful.[9]

The Fire[edit]
Early in the morning on 4 November 1907 Aldridge's fine residence was gutted by fire. No-one was harmed, and the stables were unaffected but Jim, universally described as a lovable kindhearted gentleman, felt the loss keenly, as besides family memorabilia, the whole of his stud records, racing illustrations and trophies were destroyed. The fire may have originated from a spark blowing from an open fireplace. There had been strong winds that night.[10]

Family[edit]
His brother George Sydney Aldridge (c. 1847 – 21 August 1911) was for many years Chairman of the Adelaide Stock Exchange. Other brothers were active in hotel management: George Edward "Ted" Aldridge was licensee of the Duke of Cornwall Hotel in Broken Hill.[5] Charles E. Aldridge (1858 – ) had the Crown and Sceptre Hotel on King William Street near the Railway Station in 1883. Fred C. Aldridge (1853 – ) later had the Crown and Sceptre.  A sister, Rose Annie Aldridge, married architect John Grainger (1854–1917), and is famous as the mother of Percy Grainger.
In 1880 Aldridge married Sarah Carr Aldridge ( – c. 27 July 1916), daughter of John Carr, an engineer and member of an English ship building family. Their children included:

George Richmond Aldridge (9 June 1880 – 16 June 1944) married Gladys Lennox on 30 August 1921 settled at Mount Gambier, then Bendigo, became handicapper for S.A.J.C.
Leslie Frank Aldridge (13 January 1883 – ) married Edith Maud Turnbull on 17 March 1910 settled at "Kingsclere" in Richmond, South Australia. He had, with D. C. "Dan" Cudmore (a son of J. F. Cudmore), a substantial interest in the stud at "Richmond Park", which in 1929 they moved to "Kismet Park" (owned by Sir Rupert Clarke) in Sunbury, Victoria.[11]
James William Aldridge (c. April 1888 – ) married Georgina "Rene" Fuller on 28 June 1917 settled at Booboorowie, bred horses and, notably, pigs (Berkshire and Tamworth) later at "Bridge Park", Angle Vale where he bred Large White and Gloucester Spots.
Harry Richmond Aldridge (18 January 1891 – 3 January 1976) married Kathleen Rischbieth Jury (4 July 1897 – 24 May 1981), a granddaughter of Charles Rischbieth. He ran Illeroo station, west of Port Augusta near Wilmington, South Australia and Westward Downs Station north of Broken Hill[5]
Maud Rose Aldridge ( – 18 October 1920) married John Primrose Malcom on 16 September 1908
Violet Aldridge married R. R. Marshall on 2 April 1913 and settled in Melbourne
Margaret Daisy Aldridge married John H. Morish on 15 November 1911, settled at Millswood

James ProvanMember of the European Parliamentfor North East ScotlandIn office1979–1989Preceded byNew constituencySucceeded byHenry McCubbinMember of the European Parliamentfor South Downs WestIn office1994–2004
Personal detailsBorn (1936-12-19) 19 December 1936 (age 87)ScotlandPolitical partyConservative
James Lyal Clark Provan (born 19 December 1936) is a British farmer, businessman and politician who served four terms as a Member of the European Parliament. A member of the Conservative Party, he specialised in agriculture, and became a critic of the development of the European Union and especially of the European Commission.


Family and education[edit]
Provan was born in Scotland and attended Ardvreck School in Crieff before going to Oundle School, a public school in Northamptonshire. Rather than pursue an academic career he went on to the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester. In 1960 he married Roweena Lewis; they have a daughter and twin sons.

Perthshire[edit]
In 1965 Provan became area President of Perthshire for the National Farmers Union of Scotland, a position which he also held in 1971. He was an active member of the Conservative Party in Perth and East Perthshire, being Treasurer of the local association from 1975 to 1977. He was a member of the Lord Lieutenant's Queen's Jubilee Appeal Committee in 1977.

Political career[edit]
Provan was elected to Tayside Regional Council in 1978, serving on the Tay River Purification Board. He was selected to be the Conservative Party candidate for North East Scotland for the 1979 European Parliament election, and won the seat despite only obtaining 33% of the vote when his opponents divided the rest evenly.

Agriculture committee[edit]
Immediately appointed to the Agriculture and Fisheries Committee, in March 1980 Provan voted against a proposal to increase farm prices by 7.9% because of its consequential increase in the European budget requirement and the proportion devoted to agricultural subsidies.[1] That May he was a rapporteur on a report calling for a full intervention scheme in the mutton and lamb market, which had been passed by 11 votes to 10 after French pressure and against British resistance. The Commission rejected the proposal.[2] Provan became the European Democrat group spokesman on agriculture in 1982.
Provan sponsored an emergency motion in September 1983 which condemned Greece for blocking a common European response criticising the Soviet Union shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007.[3] He was re-elected in the 1984 election with a slight improvement in his vote but still only polled 34%.

Mafia[edit]
On Provan's initiative the European Parliament set up a team to monitor the effect of milk quota system in 1984.[4] In January 1985 he endorsed the claim of a Sicilian Communist MEP that the Mafia was taking a great deal of European Community funds, stating that three former Members of the European Parliament were involved with the Mafia and that they must also have infiltrated the senior ranks of the European Commission.[5]

Defeat[edit]
Provan was elected as a Quaestor in 1987, a job that gave him responsibility for the Parliament's finance and administration. The same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. He published his analysis of the development of the European Community, "The European Community: an ever closer union?", in 1989. However, the unpopularity of the Conservative Party in Scotland made his position especially vulnerable and at the 1989 European election he was defeated, coming in third behind both the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party.
After leaving the European Parliament, Provan went into business, becoming Chairman of McIntosh Donald Ltd and of James McIntosh & Co. He was also executive director of Scottish Financial Enterprise from 1990 to 1991, and became a member of the Agricultural and Food Research Council. From 1992 to 1998 he was chairman of the Rowett Research Institute.

Retread[edit]
Having a home in the south of England, Provan was selected as Conservative candidate for South Downs West in the run-up to the 1994 European Parliament election, a much better area for the Conservatives. He was elected with a 21,000 majority and became the Chief Whip for the Conservative Group. The tensions in the group became apparent when it split three ways in a vote on approving the Santer Commission; Provan himself voted against.[6]

Animal welfare[edit]
Provan successfully moved a motion calling for a ban on veal crates and a maximum journey time of eight hours for live cattle being transported across Europe in 1995.[7] During the 1997 general election campaign, he contradicted a claim by the Referendum Party on the extent of gold reserves which the Bank of England would have to transfer for the Pound sterling to join the Euro.[8]

Reselection[edit]
He became a Vice President of the European People's Party and the party's Chief Whip in 1996. In the transition to a regional list system for elections to the European Parliament, Provan was chosen on top of the list for the South East England, attributed to his support for party leader William Hague's position on the single currency.[9] After his re-election, Provan was elected a Vice President of the European Parliament.
Provan's decision to help unveil a Scottish pro-European Union poster alongside members of other parties in October 1999 caused some trouble. Provan reminded his critics that he had voted against the euro and said that he believed Britain should join a successful single European currency.[10] However, Provan pulled out of the event at the last minute,[11] facing reported disciplinary action. He explained that it had not been made clear to him that he was the sole Scottish Conservative representative, and that it was wrong for him to go as his European Parliament constituency was in England.[12]

Retirement[edit]
In November 2001 Provan pushed the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament to undertake an inquiry into the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis, after the United Kingdom government had refused to hold one.[13] He stood down from the European Parliament in 2004.

Back In Front (foaled 14 April 1997) is a retired, Irish Thoroughbred racehorse who competed in National Hunt racing. The gelding showed early promise in National Hunt Flat races, winning twice and finishing third in an exceptionally strong renewal of the Champion Bumper. He was one of the leading novice hurdlers in the 2003–04 season, winning four races including the Supreme Novices' Hurdle in England and the Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle in Ireland. In the following season he won the Morgiana Hurdle and was regarded as a Champion Hurdle contender before being sidelined by injury. Back In Front won the Bula Hurdle in 2004 but ran poorly when joint-favourite for the Champion Hurdle in 2005. He had little success when switched to steeplechasing and was retired in 2007, having won eleven of his twenty-five races.


Background[edit]
Back In Front was a brown gelding with a small white star bred in County Limerick Ireland by Noreen Hayes. He was sired by Bob Back, a racehorse whose best performance came when he recorded an upset win over Pebbles and Commanche Run in the 1985 Prince of Wales's Stakes.[2] As a breeding stallion, he sired the St Leger Stakes winner Bob's Return, but had more success as a National Hunt sire, with his progeny including Bobs Worth, Bacchanal (Stayers' Hurdle), Thisthatandtother (Festival Trophy) and Burton Port (Reynoldstown Novices' Chase).[3] Back In Front's dam Storm Front showed some ability as a National Hunt racehorse, winning six minor races and being placed at Grade III level.[4] She was a descendant of the broodmare Drift who produced the classic winners Tide-Way and Sun Stream.[5]
In June 2000, the three-year-old gelding was sent by the Hayes' family's Knockainey stud to the Tattersalls Ireland sale, but was withdrawn. During his racing career, he was owned in partnership by Nelius Hayes and Dermot Cox and was trained by Edward O'Grady at Ballynonty, County Tipperary. Back In Front was a temperamental and headstrong horse who was sometimes difficult to manage. In 2005 O'Grady said of the gelding: "He's like Mr. T in The A-Team. They had to knock him out to get him on the plane. Well, if we want so much as to clip Back In Front, we have to knock him out. If we don't, he's the boss, he won't allow us. In previous years we've done that. This year, we just thought: OK, leave him hairy. When he first arrived with us he wasn't terribly keen to have anything done with his head. Like putting a bridle on it. We've learnt. If we want to do something that doesn't suit him, we say, That's fine. We'll come back later."[6]

Racing career[edit]
2001/2002 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races[edit]
Back In Front began his racing career competing in National Hunt Flat races, also known as "bumpers". He started 7/2 favourite for his debut at Naas Racecourse in July 2001 and won by five lengths from twenty opponents, despite being eased down in the closing stages.[7] In November he was sent to England for a bumper at Cheltenham Racecourse in which he was ridden by Norman Williamson. Starting the 100/30 second favourite in a fifteen-runner field he won by a short head from the mare Wild Dream, with the pair finishing eighteen lengths clear of the other runners.[8] The gelding returned to Cheltenham in March and was moved up in class for the Grade I Champion Bumper in which he was ridden by Charlie Swan. He briefly took the lead inside the last quarter mile before finishing third to Pizarro and Rhinestone Cowboy with Thisthatandtother in fourth and Iris's Gift fifth of the twenty-three runners. O'Grady later said of the race; "It must have been one of the most competitive bumpers that's ever been run".[9] On his final appearance of the season, he ran very poorly in the Champion INH Flat Race at Punchestown Racecourse in April, finishing tailed off in last place.

2002/2003 National Hunt season: Novice Hurdles[edit]
In the 2002/2003 National Hunt, Back In Front competed mainly in novice hurdle races. On his debut over obstacles he was ridden by Williamson in the Grade I Royal Bond Novice Hurdle at Fairyhouse Racecourse on 1 December. Racing for the first time in over seven months, he took the lead two hurdles from the finish but was caught in the closing stages and beaten one and a half lengths by Hardy Eustace, a horse who went on to win two Champion Hurdles. The gelding was dropped in class for a maiden hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse in January and won by three quarters of a length from the Willie Mullins-trained Arch Stanton, to whom he was conceding four pounds.[10] On 19 February Back In Front started 4/11 favourite against nine opponents in a novice hurdle at Limerick Racecourse. Williamson tracked the leaders before moving to the front approaching the second last flight. Back In Front accelerated clear of the field in "impressive" style and won by fourteen lengths from the four-year-old Hidden Genius.[11]
Back In Front made his second visit to the Cheltenham Festival in 2003 when he was one of nineteen runners for the Grade I Supreme Novices' Hurdle on 11 March. Ridden by Williamson, he started the 3/1 favourite, with his main rivals in the betting being Thisthatandtother (9/2) and Kicking King (13/2). He raced behind the leaders and jumped "with great fluency"[9] before moving up to second place three hurdles from the finish and taking the lead after the next obstacle. In the straight he quickened away from his opponents to win impressively by ten lengths from Kicking King, who was in turn four lengths clear of Chauvinist in third.[12] The win for the Irish-trained favourite in the opening race of the meeting was enthusiastically received by the huge crowd, and security staff were unable to prevent the horse being surrounded by celebrating supporters as he returned to the winner's enclosure. O'Grady, who had trained the ill-fated Golden Cygnet to win the race twenty-five years earlier commented "I'll be disappointed if he's not in Race Three next year".[13] On 29 April at the Punchestown Festival Back In Front started 4/11 favourite for the Grade I Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle. He took the lead approaching the last hurdle and stayed on to win "comfortably"[14] by two and a half lengths from the British-trained Limerick Boy. Three days later, over the same course and distance, the gelding was matched against more experienced rivals in the Punchestown Champion Hurdle and was made the 8/11 favourite. He took the lead at the final hurdle but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a length by the Jonjo O'Neill-trained Quazar.

2003/2004 National Hunt season[edit]
Back In Front's first run of the 2003/2004 season came in the Grade I John James McManus Memorial Hurdle over two miles at Tipperary Racecourse on 5 October. He was in second place throughout the race, proving no match for the British-trained Intersky Falcon who won by twelve lengths. Barry Geraghty took over from Williamson for the gelding's next race, the Grade II Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown on 16 November. Starting the 4/5 favourite, he looked beaten early in the straight, but stayed on strongly to take the lead after the last hurdle and won by one and a half lengths from Sacundai and Solerina.[15] After the race, O'Grady said "I thought he was beaten turning in but he showed plenty of resolution and fought well to win".[16] In December, he started 5/2 second favourite for the December Festival Hurdle at Leopardstown but finished fifth of the seven runners behind the 66/1 outsider Golden Cross. In February, after a poor performance in training, he was found to have an irregular heartbeat,[17] and then sustained a leg injury[18] which ruled him out for the rest of the season.

2004/2005 National Hunt season[edit]
After a break of almost ten months, Back In Front returned in a flat race at Navan in October 2004. Ridden by the leading flat jockey Jamie Spencer, he went clear off his rivals in the final furlong and won by three and a half lengths from the three-year-old filly Akilana. In the Morgiana Hurdle in November, he finished second to Harchibald, with the odds-on favourite Macs Joy in third. Back In Front was sent to England in the following month when he faced the leading British hurdlers Rooster Booster and Inglis Drever in the Bula Hurdle at Cheltenham. Ridden by Davy Russell, he was restrained at the back of the field before making progress approaching the second last flight. He overtook Rooster Booster before the last hurdle and won by four lengths from Inglis Drever.[19] O'Grady commented "I didn't think he was going to win coming down the hill or that he would come home as well as he did – I'd forgotten how good he is".[20] At the 2005 Cheltenham Festival Back In Front started 7/2 joint-favourite with Hardy Eustace for the Champion Hurdle, in a strong field which also included Macs Joy, Harchibald, Brave Inca, Intersky Falcon, Al Eile and Rooster Booster.[21] Ruby Walsh was given the ride on the gelding, a decision which left Davy Russell "disgusted".[22] Back In Front was among the early leaders, but weakened from the second last, finishing ninth of the fourteen runners.

Later career[edit]
Back In Front began the following season in hurdle races, finishing second to Solerina in the Lismullen Hurdle and a distant fourth behind the same mare in the Hatton's Grace Hurdle at Fairyhouse in December. He was then switched to steeplechasing, making his debut over larger obstacles at Limerick on 26 December. He survived an early mistake to take the lead approaching the last fence, where his closest pursuer fell, and won by more than thirty lengths.[23] At the 2006 Cheltenham Festival Back In Front, running for the second time over fences, started at odds of 11/1 for the Grade I Royal & SunAlliance Chase. He was in second place behind Star de Mohaison when he made a bad mistake at the penultimate fence and unseated his jockey, Patrick Flood. On his only other start of the season he finished fifth of the six runners when favourite for the Ellier Developments Novice Chase at Punchestown in April after making several jumping errors.
In November 2006, Back In Front started odds-on favourite for a chase at Clonmel Racecourse but fell five fences from the finish. Later that month he won a three-mile chase at Thurles, beating Romek by six lengths. On his final appearance, he started a 28/1 outsider for the Grade I Lexus Chase at Leopardstown in December. He was in touch with the leaders until the third fence from the finish, but then dropped back quickly and finished tailed off last of the six runners.[24]

Latina (Italian: [laˈtiːna] ⓘ) is the capital of the province of Latina, in the Lazio region, in Central Italy. As of 2024, the city has 127,486 inhabitants and is the second-largest city of the region, after the national capital Rome.[3]
It is one of the youngest cities in Italy, being founded as Littoria in 1932 under the fascist administration, when the area surrounding it which had been a swamp since antiquity was drained.


History[edit]
The inauguration of Littoria in 1932
Although the area was first settled by the Latins, the modern city was founded by Benito Mussolini on 30 June 1932 as Littoria, named for the fascio littorio. The city was inaugurated on 18 December of the same year. Littoria was populated with settlers coming mainly from Friuli and Veneto, who formed the so-called Venetian-Pontine community (today surviving only in some peripheral boroughs). The edifices and the monuments, mainly in rationalist style, were designed by famous architects and artists such as Marcello Piacentini, Angiolo Mazzoni and Duilio Cambellotti.
In 1934 it became a provincial capital and, after World War II, renamed Latina in 1946. With the arrival of other people mostly from Lazio itself, the original Venetian-like dialect was increasingly substituted by a form of Romanesco dialect.
The city coat of arms is a blue shield with a stylized drawing of the City Hall Clock Tower in the middle, standing on a field of green, and flanked by two stalks of wheat tied at the base with a red ribbon engraved with the motto LATINA OLIM PALUS ("Latina, once a swamp") in Latin. The shield is surmounted by a mural crown.

Economy[edit]
The city has some pharmaceutical, chemical industry and a strong service sector. Latina is also an important centre for agriculture (vegetables, flowers, sugar, fruit, cheese and derivates).
The former Latina nuclear power plant has been shut down and is currently undergoing decommissioning.

Government[edit]

Geography[edit]
Latina is located in the Province of Latina, part of the southern section of the region of Lazio. The city is about 62 km (39 mi) south of Rome The municipality borders on Aprilia, Cisterna di Latina, Nettuno, Pontinia, Sabaudia, Sermoneta and Sezze.

Climate[edit]
Latina has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csa) like most of southern Italy.

It can be contrasted to a legal constitution, where it is the judiciary which provides the greater checks upon government.[1] In many countries both political and legal checks will be used to control the government.

Southern Luo is a dialect cluster of Uganda and neighboring countries. Although Southern Luo dialects are mutually intelligible,[citation needed] there are six ethnically and culturally distinct varieties which are considered to be separate languages socially.[citation needed]
Proto-Southern Luo has been reconstructed by Blount & Curley (1970).[2]

Varieties[edit]
The Southern Luo dialects are classified within the Glottolog database as follows:[3]


Southern Lwoo

Naomi Henrik, 1962
 Naomi Henrik (Hebrew: נעמי הנריק, sometimes Noemi Hanreck) (née Tzalering/Zellering; June 11, 1920 - March 23, 2018) was an Israeli sculptor. She is best known for the Memorial for the Pioneers of the Road to Jerusalem [he] ("Monument for the Pathbreakers to Jerusalem") on a hill overseeing Sha'ar HaGai.[1]


Biography[edit]

Occupationfigurative painterSpouseMichael Nicolella
 Ann Gale (born 1966) is an American figurative painter based in Seattle, Washington. She is known
for her portrait paintings, which consist of an accumulation of small color patches expressing the changing light and the shifting position of her models over time. Some of her main influences are Lucian Freud, Alberto Giacometti, and Antonio López García.[1]

Gale works from live models and her process is lengthy. Once she begins to paint, she works for three-hour sessions,[2] and takes from four months to two years to complete a painting.[3] Her pieces possess a strong psychological component due to the amount of time she spends with her models. Gale's portraits are not always entirely accurate to the subject they are based upon, rather, according to Gale herself, are based upon Gale's current perception of the subject. The picture she paints may change midway through the painting process if Gale notices a change in the subject's posing.[4]Ann Gale, Rachel, 2007, oil on canvasGale received her BFA from the Rhode Island College in 1988 and her MFA from Yale University in 1991. She has been the recipient of several awards including: Western States Art Federation/National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship (1996), Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grant (1997), Trust Grant/GAP Award (2003) and a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship (2007).[3] The artist's work has been shown in galleries and museums across the United States including solo exhibitions at the Portland Art Museum, Portland, Oregon (2007) and the Weatherspoon Art Museum at The University of North Carolina at Greensboro (2008). Gale is a professor of painting at the University of Washington School of Art. She is married to the classical guitarist and composer Michael Nicolella.[citation needed]

De Krook is a library and media center in Ghent (Dutch: Gent), East Flanders, Belgium. It is an initiative of the city of Ghent, Ghent University and IMEC, and describes itself as "a place of inspiration for knowledge, culture and innovation" in the city.[1][2] The library opened its doors on 10 March 2017, though construction was not fully completed until a year later.[3] Its name refers to the curve ("krook") of the river Scheldt that wraps around the northern and eastern sides of the site, and to its district, the Waalse Krook.


History[edit]
The design competition for the new building attracted 99 entries. The design by Catalan architectural firm RCR Arquitectes in collaboration with Ghent architectural firm Coussée & Goris was chosen. The new building is part of an urban renewal project that will also include renovation of the former Winter Circus. The site was redeveloped with attention to greenery and comfort for cyclists, as the quays along the river were lowered and moorings for pleasure craft and taxi boats were built on the side of the library. Some streets in the area were also redeveloped.
Despite these benefits, the building of the library did not go ahead without controversy. In April 2018, the first part of a bridge connecting De Krook with the Brabantdam was built.[4] In May 2016, the original route of the proposed bridge had to be changed in response to a possible violation of privacy by residents of Sint-Jansvest.[5] In September 2018, several residents went to the Council for Permit Disputes.[6] The Council annulled the building permit for the second part of the bridge in April 2019.
Nonetheless, in May 2018, De Krook won the Real Estate Society Award for Best (Semi-)Public Development.[7][8]

Use[edit]
In addition to its function as a library, the building aims to become a meeting place and offer the opportunity for visitors to discover new technologies, such as 3D printing and virtual reality, attend workshops and see library exhibitions. The collaboration with Ghent University and IMEC ensures that visitors are kept informed of the latest developments in information technology. Also Urgent.fm has its location in the building. At the back of the ground floor there is a reading café.
The library is accessible via an open square, the Miriam Makebaplein, named after the South African singer Miriam Makeba, and via a new pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Muinkschelde, the Albertina Sisulu Bridge, named after the South African anti-apartheid fighter Albertina Sisulu. Volunteers helped to form a chain when the nearby former library on Woodrow Wilsonplein moved to the new location.[9] In total, approximately 200,000 items in the collection had to be moved.

Residents[edit]
Whereas the first three floors of De Krook are occupied by the public library, different research groups have their offices on the 4th floor. Ghent University is present with research groups imec-mict-UGent under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Lieven De Marez and with research group IPEM under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Marc Leman. The first focuses on research on human-technology interactions from an interdisciplinary perspective[10] (communication sciences, psychology, engingeering) and the latter focuses on musical interactions and embodied music.[11] Besides Ghent University, also the AI & Data department of IMEC and start-ups participating in the imec.istart[12] program have their offices in De Krook. 

Tax case[edit]
In 2019, the Special Tax Inspectorate (BBI) demanded 11 to 14 million euros in overdue VAT and interest from the company behind De Krook. As the building is not merely a library, it would not have been fully exempt from VAT. At the end of December 2019, De Krook reached an agreement with the BBI, whereby some parts benefited from a VAT exemption and others did not. This means that the final VAT debt would only amount to a quarter to a third of the original amount demanded.[13]

The Super City Rangers were a New Zealand basketball team based in Auckland. The Rangers competed in the National Basketball League (NBL) and played their home games across multiple venues in Auckland.

Team history[edit]
The Waitakere Rangers debuted in the National Basketball League (NBL) in 1990 but withdrew following the 1995 season. Waitakere Basketball continued to hold a valid NBL licence as of 2004 but were never able to reactivate it.[1] After joining the Conference Basketball League (CBL), the Rangers won the CBL title in 1996 and finished runners-up in 2006.[2][3][4]
In 2013, the Rangers reemerged as a consolidated Auckland franchise and returned to the NBL after an 18-year absence.[5][6] As the Super City Rangers, the team reached the NBL final in 2016, where they lost 94–82 to the Wellington Saints.[7]
In August 2019, the Rangers franchise was terminated by the NBL due to multiple breaches of their participation agreement, including having outstanding debts and fees owed to the league. A review of the franchise had started prior to the conclusion of the 2019 season, citing missed deadlines for league payments and late payments to players as concerning issues that raised red flags.[8][9]

Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya  (14 October 1924 – 6 August 1997) was an Indian writer. He was one of the pioneers of modern Assamese literature. He was the first ever Assamese writer to receive the Jnanpith Award, which was awarded to him in the year 1979 for his novel Mrityunjay (Immortal),[1] followed by Indira Goswami in 2001.[2] He was also a recipient of Sahitya Akademi Award in Assamese in 1961 for his Assamese novel Iyaruingam, which is considered a masterpiece of Indian literature.[3] In 2005, a translation of the work published by Katha Books with the title Love in the Time of Insurgency was released.[4] Another famous novel written by Bhattacharya is Aai (Mother).
He was the President of Asam Sahitya Sabha (Assam Literary Society) during 1983-1985.[5] In 1997, Bhattacharyya died due to a brief illness at the private college hospital in Guwahati.[6]


Editor of 'Ramdhenu'[edit]
Dr Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya earned the respect of the entire Assamese modern literary sphere for playing a very crucial torch-bearer's role in discovering, nurturing and promoting young literary talents in Assam from 1960s as the Editor of the historic Assamese literary journal Ramdhenu. His role as the Editor of this milestone Assamese literary journal was so prominent and effective that the entire period of its publication in the mid-20th century in Assam is still referred as revered as Ramdhenu Era of Assamese literature. This Ramdhenu Era is deemed to be the golden era of in the long journey of the modern Assamese literature.
All the major discoveries of Dr Bhattacharya during the famous Ramdhenu Era are deemed to be the top Assamese and Indian litterateurs of the second half of the 20th century, and their reign writ large over the social conscience of the Assamese nationhood in the early decades of the 21st century. His most prominent literary discoveries of during the Ramdhenu Era who left undeniable mark in different domains of Assamese literature during the next half century and more till the dawn of 21st century are Lakshmi Nandan Bora, Bhabendra Nath Saikia, Saurav Kumar Chaliha, Navakanta Barua, Bhabananda Deka, Nirmal Prabha Bordoloi, Padma Barkataki, Homen Borgohain, Hiren Bhattacharya, Chandraprasad Saikia, Nilmoni Phukan Sr, Hiren Gohain, Mamoni Raisom Goswami and several others. Even after Ramdhenu stopped publication, Dr Bhattacharya remained active as the leading Indian literary critic, and continued his mission of discovering extraordinary literary talents in Assam. He used to write literary criticism and reviews of much younger authors till the mid-1980s, if he found unparalleled literary works having bright promise to emerge as influential writers in the next few decades. His penultimate literary discovery was a school student named Arnab Jan Deka, about whose first published book Ephanki Rhode('A Stanza of Sunlight'), published during his school-student days as 10th standard matriculate in 1983, Dr Bhattacharya wrote his swan-song critical literary article, which was published in a literary journal Gandhaar in 1987.[7] Through such magnanimity and impartial literary credentials, Dr Bhattacharya became part of legend and folklore in the domain of Indian literature during his lifetime. His gift of discovering extraordinary literary talents and further acts of selfless promotion of such genuine such writers made his a part of legend and folklore during his lifetime.

Hadena compta, the varied coronet, is a moth of the family Noctuidae. The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. It is found in Europe, Morocco, Algeria, Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, central Asia, southern Russia, China and Japan.


Technical description and variation[edit]
For a key to the terms used, see Glossary of entomology terms.
The wingspan is 25–30 mm. Seitz describes it: Forewing smaller than nana, with a vertical white fascia, the orbicular stigma, the white blotch beyond claviform and a blotch at middle of inner margin being confluent; no apical white blotch; — in viscariae Guen. the white fascia becomes yellowish or brownish; — humilis Christ [now full species Hadena humilis (Christoph, 1893)], from Armenia and the Taurus Mts., also has the fascia discoloured and much reduced in size, the ground colour often being dull grey. — Larva reddish grey; dorsal stripe redbrown, blotched on each segment and traversed by a conspicuous white central line; lateral lines yellowish; spiracles white on a cloudy grey shade; head redbrown.[1]

Biology[edit]
The moth flies from May to July depending on the location.[citation needed]
The larvae feed on Dianthus barbatus and Silene vulgaris.

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hadena_compta&oldid=958854769"Multiple-prism grating laser oscillators,[1] or MPG laser oscillators, use multiple-prism beam expansion to illuminate a diffraction grating mounted either in Littrow configuration or grazing-incidence configuration.  Originally, these narrow-linewidth tunable dispersive oscillators were introduced as multiple-prism Littrow (MPL) grating oscillators,[2] or hybrid multiple-prism near-grazing-incidence (HMPGI) grating cavities,[3][4] in organic dye lasers.  However, these designs were quickly adopted for other types of lasers such as gas lasers,[5][6] diode lasers,[7][8] and more recently fiber lasers.[9]

Multiple-prism grating narrow-linewidth tunable laser oscillator.[10] The grating in this particular oscillator is deployed in Littrow configuration.

Excitation[edit]
Multiple-prism grating laser oscillators can be excited either electrically, as in the case of gas lasers and semiconductor lasers,[11] or optically, as in the case of crystalline lasers and organic dye lasers.[1]  In the case of optical excitation it is often necessary to match the polarization of the excitation laser to the polarization preference of the multiple-prism grating oscillator.[1]  This can be done using a polarization rotator thus improving the laser conversion efficiency.[11]

Linewidth performance[edit]
The multiple-prism dispersion theory is applied to design these beam expanders either in additive configuration, thus adding or subtracting  their dispersion to the dispersion of the grating, or in compensating configuration (yielding zero dispersion at a design wavelength) thus allowing the diffraction grating to control the tuning characteristics of the laser cavity.[11] Under those conditions, that is, zero dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander, the single-pass laser linewidth is given by[1][11]

where

{\displaystyle \Delta \theta }

 is the beam divergence and M is the beam magnification provided by the beam expander that multiplies the angular dispersion provided by the diffraction grating.  In the case of multiple-prism beam expanders this factor can be as high as 100–200.[1][11]
When the dispersion of the multiple-prism expander is not equal to zero, then the single-pass linewidth is given by[1][11]

where the first differential refers to the angular dispersion from the grating and the second differential refers to the overall dispersion from the multiple-prism beam expander.[1][11]
Optimized solid-state multiple-prism grating laser oscillators have been shown, by Duarte, to generate pulsed single-longitudinal-mode emission limited only by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.[12]  The laser linewidth in these experiments is reported as

Kegworth railway station  located in Nottinghamshire was a station serving the villages of Kegworth, Leicestershire, Sutton Bonington, and Kingston on Soar, Nottinghamshire.

History[edit]
It was opened in 1840 for the Midland Counties Railway, which shortly joined the North Midland Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway to form the Midland Railway.
This line is now part of the Midland Main Line between Loughborough and East Midlands Parkway railway station.
It was built in the typical MCR fashion, the main building positioned at a higher level and steps leading down onto the platform. It closed in 1968 and only the station house and the goods shed remain. Until 1971 there was a standard gauge mineral railway between the main line and  New Kingston gypsum mine.[2]
There has been local pressure to open it. However a new station, East Midlands Parkway has now been built at Ratcliffe-on-Soar. Currently only taxis serve to connect it to the nearby East Midlands Airport, forcing the majority of people to use the Skylink (bus service) from Nottingham, Loughborough, Leicester or Derby, but with improvements to the Erewash Valley Line has the potential to be a hub for local services from Nottingham and Derby to connect with a high speed service from London to Sheffield and the North.

The Ministry of Education (Portuguese: Ministério da Educação), also known as MEC, an initialism derived from its former name Ministry of Education and Culture (Portuguese: Ministério da Educação e Cultura), is a cabinet-level federal ministry of Brazil.
It is tasked with coordinating national education policy and daily affairs, from early childhood to the post-graduate level.[2]


History of the institution[edit]
Before 1930, matters relating to education were under responsibility of the National Department of Education (Portuguese: Departamento Nacional do Ensino), which was a part of the then-called Ministry of Justice.
In 1930, as Getúlio Vargas took office as president, the Ministry of Education and Public Health (Portuguese: Ministério da Educação e Saúde Pública) was created, taking away education matters from the Ministry of Justice.
In 1953, the ministry was split into two: the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Education and Culture (Portuguese: Ministério da Educação e Cultura, with the acronym MEC, which lasts to this day).
In 1985, during José Sarney's presidency, it was again split into two: the Ministry of Culture, and the Ministry of Education.
In 1992, as Itamar Franco took office as president, sports were made part of the ministry again, which was subsequently renamed Ministry of Education and Sports (Portuguese: Ministério da Educação e do Desporto).
In 1995, during Fernando Henrique Cardoso's presidency, that was once again changed, separating the Ministry of Education from the then Ministry of Sports.
The incumbent Education Minister is senator Camilo Santana.[3]

Karim Khan Sadiq (Pashto: كريم خان صادق; born 28 February 1984) is an Afghan cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman who occasionally serves as a wicket-keeper for the Afghanistan national team. He can also bowl off break, and took 4 wickets for 27 runs against Denmark in their first match of the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier.


Early career[edit]
Sadiq is a part of the rapidly rising Afghan cricket team that in under a year has won the World Cricket League Division Five, Division Four and Division Three, thus promoting them to Division Two and allowing them to partake in the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier's.
He was suspended for one match during the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier due to "inappropriate and intentional physical contact" in their defeat to the Netherlands.[1] During the tournament he performed well with the bat, top scoring with 92, and, surprisingly for a wicketkeeper, with the ball.

Quitting Afghanistan[edit]
Shortly after Afghanistan achieved ODI status, Sadiq quit the national setup as he was upset at his brother, Hasti Gul, being dropped for their ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Zimbabwe XI. Sadiq accused national coach Kabir Khan of not acting in the best interest of the team.[2]

Return[edit]
Sadiq's international retirement was short lived, as he made his first-class debut in January 2010 against Ireland, where he made scores of 19 and 1.
In February 2010, Sadiq made his Twenty20 International debut in the Sri Lanka Associates T20 Series against Ireland. Sadiq took 2/17 with the ball. Afghanistan lost the match by 5 wickets. Later, Sadiq was a key member of Afghanistan's World Twenty20 Qualifier winning team. He was later named in Afghanistan's squad for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.[3]
Sadiq was a key member of Afghanistan's 2010 ACC Trophy Elite winning squad, which defeated Nepal in the final by 95 runs. In final, Sadiq top-scored for Afghanistan with 58 runs. In Afghanistan's first match of the tournament, he scored 130 runs off 92 balls against Bhutan in Afghanistan's 393-run win.
He later played for the newly formed Afghan Cheetahs team in the Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup 2011-12. Sadiq later featured in Afghanistan's first One Day International against a Full Member Test-playing nation when they played Pakistan at Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium in February 2012. Sadiq top scored in Afghanistan's innings with 40 runs, before becoming one of Shahid Afridi's five wickets. Pakistan won the encounter by 7 wickets.[4]
In September 2018, he was named in Kandahar's squad in the first edition of the Afghanistan Premier League tournament.[5]

List of episodes
The pilot episode of Dirk Gently is the first broadcast episode of the BBC Four television series inspired by Douglas Adams's novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.[1]  First broadcast on 16 December 2010 and repeated throughout the Christmas period, it was written by Howard Overman and stars Stephen Mangan as holistic detective Dirk Gently and Darren Boyd as his sidekick Richard Macduff. Recurring actors include Helen Baxendale as Susan Harmison, Jason Watkins as DI Gilks and Lisa Jackson as Janice Pearce.
In the hour-long pilot, "holistic detective" Dirk Gently is hired by an old lady to investigate the disappearance of a cat, a case that gives him a new fridge and re-acquaints him with two old friends from university. Together they uncover a plot involving time travel, unrequited love, depression and murder.
The comedy-drama is a loose adaptation of plot elements from Adams' 1987 novel Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency, although it updates the detective to the present day and focuses on only a few of the original novel's characters and plot threads. Critical reception to the pilot was generally positive, and in March 2011 BBC Four announced that it had commissioned a three-part series of one hour-long episodes, the first continuing drama series produced for the channel.[2][3]


Production[edit]
Shooting commenced early in October 2010 in Bristol.[4] The director was Damon Thomas and the producer was Chris Carey. Although it was commissioned by the BBC, it was produced by ITV Studios with The Welded Tandem Picture Company. The pilot was first broadcast on BBC Four on 16 December 2010 and was repeated a number of times during the next month.[5][6] The pilot gained a commission on 31 March 2011 for a three-part series of one hour-long episodes to be broadcast on BBC Four in 2012.[2][3]
The screenplay by Howard Overman is not a direct adaptation of Adams's novel, but uses certain characters and situations from the novel to form the basis of a new drama centred on Dirk.[7] Stephen Mangan, writing a BBC blog on the programme stated "In my opinion, Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-Time Of The Soul are unfilmable as written...too much happens, there are too many ideas".[8]
The pilot concentrates on two relatively minor plot strands in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency: the disappearance of a cat, and the simultaneous disappearance of millionaire Gordon Way. Although time travel is involved in the solution, the novel's entire St Cedd's College / Electric Monk / Coleridge strand is omitted, although key words relating to these elements do appear on Dirk's whiteboard when it is first seen, though they are never subsequently referred to.[1][9] The setting is updated to 2010, with email and voicemail replacing the answering machine messages in the book. There are changes to the characters too, one notable one being that Susan is Gordon's ex-girlfriend rather than his sister.[9]

Cast[edit]
Stephen Mangan, best known for his role in the television series Green Wing, and subsequently Episodes, was cast in the main role as holistic detective Dirk Gently. Mangan already knew the novel and the author's works, stating in a press release "I've been a fan of Douglas Adams ever since the Hitchhiker's radio series which I used to record as a child and listen to over and over again in my bedroom. It's such a thrill to now be playing one of his brilliant characters. Dirk is a chaotic, anarchic force of nature with a totally unique take on the world. He is described as 'lazy, untidy, dismissive and unreliable'. I've absolutely no idea why they thought I'd be right for the role."[7] Cast alongside him were Darren Boyd and Helen Baxendale, both of whom had previously worked with Mangan in Green Wing and Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years respectively.[4]
The pilot also featured Doreen Mantle as Ruth, Anthony Howell as Gordon Way, Miles Richardson as Dr Gerstenberger and Billy Boyle as Harry.

Plot[edit]
The episode opens with private investigator Dirk Gently asking the elderly Mrs Jordan for payment in his ongoing search for her missing cat Henry. Leaving Mrs Jordan's house, he witnesses his old friend Richard McDuff breaking into her neighbour's house. It transpires that Richard was attempting to steal a laptop belonging to his girlfriend Susan Harmison, whom Richard has just split up with and has sent an insulting e-mail, which he now regrets.
On spotting clues suggesting the presence of the missing cat, they follow it into a nearby warehouse and encounter a bizarre machine. However, an explosion destroys the machine before they can investigate. It later transpires that the warehouse belongs to their fellow university alumnus, Gordon Way, a millionaire computer expert (and Susan's former suitor at college) who has gone missing.
Dirk soon deduces that events all seem to connect with 5 December 1994, as that is the date where Susan broke up with Gordon  because he missed a date (due to Dirk accidentally running Gordon over in his Austin Princess, when trying to escape an angry Richard), and the date on which Mrs Jordan's first cat, George, walked into her house. Recalling the equipment that he and Richard found in a warehouse near Susan's house, Dirk deduces that Gordon Way had developed a time machine to go back and save his relationship with Susan before it went wrong, with Mrs Jordan's cat getting into the machine with him and being sent back to the past (meaning that Mrs Jordan's two cats were actually the same cat).
Gordon, it is revealed, was killed in the past by Mrs Jordan after he saw her with her husband's dead body (Mrs Jordan having killed her husband when he began to mistreat the 'new' cat). Mrs Jordan subsequently commits suicide after tricking Dirk, Richard and Susan into leaving her so that she will not have to go to prison. At the episode's conclusion, Dirk has tricked Richard, via hypnosis, into investing his redundancy money into Dirk's firm, allowing Dirk to go to Barbados on an "investigation" while Richard is left as Dirk's new partner in the detective agency.

Reception[edit]
Dirk drives an elderly brown Austin Princess in the production.
The pilot episode gained 1.1m viewers (3.9% share) on BBC Four, which was over three times the channel's slot average.[2] Critical reception for the pilot was largely positive. Several mentioned that it was only a loose adaptation of the novel, although the general consensus was that the essence of the original was maintained. Sam Wollaston in The Guardian stated "Coming to it fresh, it's a neat story about aforementioned missing cat and time travel, with a smattering of quantum physics and the fundamental connectedness of things. With a lovely performance from Doreen Mantle as the old lady/murderer. Stephen Mangan's good in the title role, too – a teeny bit irritating perhaps, but then Mangan is a teeny bit irritating. So is Dirk Gently, though – it's perfect. Funny too. Quite funny."[10] James Donaghy, also writing in The Guardian stated "Personally I hope Dirk Gently gets made into a full series. The programme shows promising glimpses, has a strong cast and Misfits already proves Overman can write. And a BBC4 adaptation feels like a good fit – Gently being exactly the kind of playground-of-the-imagination curio the BBC made its name indulging."[1]
The Independent published two reviews. Alice-Azania Jarvis was extremely positive, writing "...there wasn't very much you could fault about the production at all. Right down to the quirky camerawork and youthful, poppy soundtrack (who would have thought the Hoosiers could be so right in any situation?), the director, Damon Thomas, got it pretty spot-on. The result was a pleasingly festive-feeling adventure; part Wallace & Gromit, part Doctor Who, part The Secret Seven. And the best thing? There wasn't a Christmas tree in sight. Douglas Adams once claimed that Gently would make a better film character than his more famous hero, Arthur Dent. Based on last night's experience, he may well have been right."[11] John Walsh's review for The Independent was cooler about the adaptation, although he praised Mangan's performance: "Given the talent and style on display, it should have been a scream. In fact it all seemed a little moth-eaten. Though set in the modern day, it was staggeringly old-fashioned...You could overlook these faults, however, for the joy of Stephen Mangan's performance as the titular gumshoe. With his alarmed-spaniel eyes and jutting-jawed stroppiness, his geography teacher elbow-patches and Medusan hair, he radiates mess...His ineptness as a sleuth provided some fine comic moments."[12]
Keith Watson in Metro was also positive, although he noted "At times it felt forced, with a sense of trying slightly too hard when a touch more subtlety would have brought out the essential Adamsian eccentricity."[13] Dan Owen of Obsessed with Film noted that the adaptation played with the idea of inexplicable situations: "Purists may grumble this isn't the Dirk Gently they wanted to see, but it's more accessible and practicable. And while Dirk Gently is certainly another gimmicky detective series (yawn), its details are unique and engrossing enough to shrug off the genre's clichés. In some ways it's a pastiche of whodunits, taking the genre's often tenuous explanations to an outrageous extreme."[14]
Paul Whitelaw in The Scotsman noted that "Although Adams's more ambitious concepts are sidelined in favour of a more prosaic - if nonetheless enjoyable - sci-fi mystery, Overman captures at least some of the wit and whimsy of his distinctive comic voice" going on to suggest "This modestly-budgeted pilot suggests potential for a series, so the deviation from Adams's originals makes sense. It also adds yet another very British oddball to the pantheon currently occupied by Doctor Who and Sherlock.[15]

A lock screen is a computer user interface element used by various operating systems. They regulate immediate access to a device by requiring the user to perform a certain action in order to receive access, such as entering a password, using a certain button combination, or performing a certain gesture using a device's touchscreen. There are various authentication methods to get past the lock screen, with the most popular and common ones being personal identification numbers (PINs), the Android pattern lock, and biometrics (e.g. Touch ID and facial recognition).[1]
Depending on the operating system and device type, a lock screen can range from a simple login screen, to an overview screen with the current date and time, weather, recent notifications, playback controls for media being played in the background (typically music), shortcuts to applications (such as the camera), and optionally, the contact information of the device's owner (which can be used in the event that the device is lost or stolen, or during a medical emergency).[2][3][4]


Lock screens by platform[edit]
Mobile operating systems[edit]
Mobile operating system that run on smartphones and tablets typically use a gesture based lock-screen. Phones manufactured by Neonode were unlocked by swiping to the right on its touchscreen. Apple's iOS, used by the iPhone and iPad lines, utilized a similar unlock mechanism until iOS 10, with an on-screen slider slid to the right. Beginning on iOS 5, sliding in the other direction sends the user directly to the camera app. On iOS 7, the slider widget was removed as part of a larger overhaul of the iOS interface, and users could now swipe from any point on the screen. The lock screen also displays a clock, notifications, and provides audio playback controls.[5][6] iOS 10 made major changes to the lock screen, replacing the sliding gesture with pressing the Home button. Swiping is still used to access the camera, as well as an additional page to the left with widgets.[7][8] As the iPhone X and iPad Pro do not have physical home buttons, the user must swipe upwards from the bottom of the screen instead.[9][10]
At first, Android did not use a gesture-based lock screen, electing to require the user to press the phone's Menu button. On Android 2.0, a new gesture-based lock screen was introduced, displaying two icons: one for unlocking the phone, and one for setting the volume mode, activated by dragging the relevant icon to the center of the screen on a curve (similarly to a rotary dial). On Android 2.1, the rotary dial was replaced by two tabs on either end of the screen.[11] Android 3.0 introduced a new design: a ball with a padlock icon is dragged to the outside of a circular area.[12] On 4.0, the option to unlock straight to the camera is provided, while 4.1 adds the ability to unlock into a Google Search screen by dragging up.[13][14] Android 4.2 makes additional changes to the lock screen, allowing users to add widgets to pages accessible on the lock screen by swiping from the left edge of the screen. The camera is accessed in a similar manner by swiping from the right edge of the screen.[14] Android also allows devices to be locked using either a password, passcode, a pattern on a grid of 9 circles, fingerprint sensing, or facial recognition.[11]
Android distributions by other manufacturers typically use different lock screen designs than what stock Android utilizes; some versions of HTC's Sense used a metallic ring dragged from the bottom of the screen to unlock the phone, and also allows users to launch apps by dragging their respective shortcut icon into the ring instead.[15] On Samsung devices, the lock screen involves dragging in any direction from any location on the screen (TouchWiz Nature devices, such as the Galaxy S III and S4, are also accompanied by a visual effect, such as a pond ripple or lens flare); similarly to HTC's lock screen, app shortcuts can be dragged up from the bottom of the screen to unlock directly into them.[16][17]

PC operating systems[edit]
Windows 11's lock screen
Windows NT has offered the ability for users to "lock" their computers by displaying a login window, which requires the active user's password to be entered to re-gain access to the system. Since Windows XP, the lock function has also been bound to the keyboard shortcut ⊞ Win+L.[18] On Windows 8, the lock screen was re-designed to closer resemble those used by mobile operating systems; users can choose a distinct wallpaper for use on the lock screen, which now also displays a clock, calendar events, and notifications from other apps. The screen can be dragged upwards with a mouse or touchscreen to unlock the device.[19] Windows 10 maintains this design, whilst adding the ability to use the Cortana voice assistant from the lock screen, and support for slide shows, and the "Windows Spotlight" service to retrieve daily wallpapers and optionally receive advertising and suggestions related to the wallpaper.[20][21]
Screen locking functionality is also built into screensaver systems on some Unix-like operating systems, such as XScreenSaver[22] and gnome-screensaver.[23]

Monetization[edit]
Particularly on Android, custom lock screen software can be designed to replace the default lock screen with one that displays advertising or otherwise sponsored content.[24][25] Amazon's Android-based Kindle Fire tablets display notifications of "special offers" on its lock screen, unless users purchase a more expensive SKU of the device which disables this feature.[26] In 2016, Amazon began to market discounted smartphones exclusive to Amazon Prime subscribers that are subsidized by "special offers" and pre-loaded Amazon apps.[27] In November 2017, Google Play Store prohibited apps from displaying advertisements on the lock screen unless the app is specifically designed to replace the lock screen, citing issues with adware embedded in unrelated apps.[28] The Indian company Glance produces a lock screen replacement that displays a content feed on the lock screen, which is monetized via advertising.[25]

Patent litigation[edit]
Courts cited mobile phones by Neonode as prior art for Apple's iOS lock screen.
Apple holds several patents related to the sliding lock screen used by its iOS devices: it was granted U.S. patent 7,657,849 in 2010, and U.S. patent 8,046,721 in 2011, describing a system that involves continuously dragging an image to a certain point to unlock the device.[29] As part of ongoing patent wars between numerous companies surrounding patents related to mobile devices, Apple asserted these patents in several patent infringement lawsuits outside the United States with competing vendors.[30]
Apple's lawsuits with Samsung in the Netherlands and HTC in the United Kingdom both led to failure: both courts ruled the patents to be invalid, citing the similar lock screen on the N1, a mobile phone manufactured by the Swedish company Neonode, as prior art for Apple's design. The British court specifically ruled that Apple's lock screen[31] was an "obvious improvement" over that of the Neonode N1 due to its additional visual feedback through an on-screen slider graphic (unlike the N1, which only displayed a written instruction explaining the gesture).[29][32] Early work on touchscreen technology from the University of Maryland Human – Computer Interaction Lab was also cited as prior art,[33] in particular a 1991 touchscreen slider developed by Catherine Plaisant.[34]
In January 2012, Apple won a permanent injunction from a German court after it ruled that Motorola Mobility violated the patents on some of its recent devices (although the Motorola Xoom tablet was ruled not to have infringed on the patent). However, Apple was warned that they would have been required to put up a bond as insurance if they were to allow the injunction to take effect, and any potential sales ban as a result would be limited to Germany.[30][35]

Hornelen is a mountain in Bremanger Municipality in Vestland county, Norway.  The mountain sits on the eastern end of the island of Bremangerlandet, along the Frøysjøen strait, in the Nordfjord region of Norway.  At 860 metres (2,820 ft), it is the highest sea cliff in Europe (see illustration left), and has for a long time been used as a landmark for naval navigation.  It is a 4-hour hike to the summit from Berleneset (across the small fjord from the village of Berle).[3]

Comparison of cliffs in Europe
The horizontal distance from the summit to the sea is approximately 500 metres (1,600 ft).  Approximately 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the west of the cliffside is the highest point on the island Bremangerlandet, called Svartevassegga which has an elevation of 889 metres (2,917 ft).  The rock in Hornelen consists of sandstone of Devonian age, and it constitutes an important part of the geology of Norway.[4]

Brianne Alexandra Jenner (born May 4, 1991) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player and captain of Ottawa of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) and a member of Canada women's national ice hockey team.
She made her debut for Canada at the 2010 Four Nations Cup and won a gold medal. She played college hockey with the Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program.
Before signing in the PWHL, Jenner served on the board of directors of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) and currently serves on the executive committee of the Professional Women's Hockey League Players Association (PWHLPA).


Playing career[edit]
In high school, Jenner was the Appleby College hockey team captain. Jenner played junior hockey in the Provincial Women's Hockey League with the Stoney Creek Sabres. She was also the captain of Team Ontario Red at the 2008 National Women's Under-18 Championship. She scored the game-winning goal in double overtime of the gold medal game.[1]

Cornell[edit]
On October 29 and 30, 2010, Jenner played a role in both victories for the Cornell Big Red ice hockey team. On October 29, she had three assists at Quinnipiac. The following day, she scored a pair of goals and added an assist at Princeton.[2]
During three games from February 7 to February 11, 2012, Jenner led her team with eight points. Versus nationally ranked Mercyhurst, Jenner had a goal and an assist in a February 7 victory over Mercyhurst. In a 5–0 shutout win over the Brown Bears (on February 10), Jenner garnered two assists from two goals. On February 11, Jenner scored the game-winning goal versus the Yale Bulldogs that clinched the ECAC Hockey regular-season championship. In addition, she scored another goal, earning her 30th assist of the season.[citation needed]

CWHL[edit]
Before going to college, Jenner played with the Mississauga Chiefs during the 2008–09 Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) season. The following season, she joined the Burlington Barracudas, and then left for Cornell in 2010.
On June 6, 2015, Jenner announced her entry into the 2015 CWHL Draft with the intention of being selected by the Calgary Inferno, as she would also be studying for a master's degree in public policy at the University of Calgary and would be able to play alongside three or more Cornell Big Red graduates.[3][4] Jenner captained the Inferno and helped the team capture their first Clarkson Cup championship in 2016. Contested at Ottawa's Canadian Tire Centre, she scored twice in an 8–3 victory over Les Canadiennes de Montréal.[5] She helped the team win a second Clarkson Cup title in 2019.[6] After the 2018–19 season, the CWHL abruptly ceased operations.

PWHPA[edit]
After the collapse of the CWHL in 2019, Jenner helped launch the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA), which led a boycott of the remaining North American professional league, the National Women's Hockey League, in a bid to gather support for the establishment of a unified, financially sustainable professional league.[7] Jenner skated for Team Sonnet (Toronto) in the 2021 Secret Cup, the Canadian leg of the 2020–21 PWHPA Dream Gap Tour. She recorded one goal in a 4-2 championship game loss versus Team Bauer (Montreal).[8]

PWHL[edit]
Following the PWHPA and the rival Premier Hockey Federation consolidating into the new Professional Women's Hockey League in 2023, Jenner was one of three initial free agent signings made by PWHL Ottawa. She and fellow Team Canada members Emily Clark and Emerance Maschmeyer were the first players announced by any team in the league.[9][10] On December 29, 2023, Jenner was named Ottawa's captain.[11] Jenner scored her first PWHL goal on January 23, 2024, in a 3–1 win over Toronto.[12]

International play[edit]
Jenner with Team Canada in 2017
In a January 9, 2008, contest versus Germany at the inaugural World Women's Under-18 hockey championship, Jenner scored twice and earned an assist in a 10–1 win.[13] Jenner participated in tryouts for the senior national team ahead of the 2010 Olympics and 2011 World Championships, but did not make the rosters—she instead made her senior debut at the 2012 Women's World Championship.[7][14] Jenner was named to the 2014 Olympic roster for Canada.[15] She was named assistant captain of the national team in 2015.[7]
On January 11, 2022, Jenner was named to Canada's 2022 Olympic team.[16][17][18] Her 9 goals in the tournament tied the Olympic record for most goals in a single women's tournament, capping off a tournament MVP nod and her 2nd Olympic gold medal.[19]

Personal life[edit]
In July 2019, Jenner married her longtime partner Hayleigh Cudmore, a former teammate with Cornell and the Calgary Inferno.[20][21][22]
Jenner served on the board of directors for the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) and, upon the formation of the PWHL in 2023, was named to the labour union's executive committee.[7][23]

The term professional student has two uses in the university setting:

In the United States and Canada, if not elsewhere, a professional student is a student majoring in what are considered the professional degrees.  These include Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Law (J.D. or LL.B.), Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), Medicine (M.D. or D.O.), Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), Engineering, Business Administration (M.B.A.), Nursing (B.Sc.N.), and Pharmacy (Pharm.D. or B.Sc.Phm.), as well as many others.
"Professional student" is a slang term commonly used in colleges to describe a student who stays in school for many years rather than embarking on a career. To avoid these types, some four-year colleges have imposed limits on the length of time students can be enrolled in order to open up their limited slots to new students.  However, those colleges allow for demonstrated exceptions (e.g., a student who holds down a full-time occupation or has a family to raise, who is clearly demonstrating progress toward a degree). See: perpetual student.
A less common meaning for "professional student" is an individual who makes a living writing papers and doing college work in exchange for pay from other people.

The 2020–21 South West Peninsula League season was the 14th in the history of the South West Peninsula League, a football competition in England, that feeds the Premier Division of the Western Football League. The league was formed in 2007 from the merger of the Devon County League and the South Western League, and is restricted to clubs based in Cornwall and Devon. The two divisions of the South West Peninsula League are on the same level of the National League System as the Western League Division One (Step 6).
The constitution was announced on 21 July 2020.[1]
After the abandonment of the previous season due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[2] the league's constitution remained unchanged.
This season, the top two clubs in each division were to be promoted to Step 5. The bottom two clubs in each division would have been liable to relegation.[3]
By October 2020, the poor start to the season suffered by Stoke Gabriel in Premier Division East had attracted attention from the national press. It was the worst start to the season by any club in the top ten levels of English football.[4]


Suspension and curtailment[edit]
Fixtures were temporarily suspended on 30 December 2020, again due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but were later suspended until further notice.[5] The FA curtailed the season for all leagues at steps 3–6 on 24 February, with no further league fixtures to be played.[6]
The scheduled restructuring of non-league football took place at the end of the season. Promotions from Step 6 to 5 were based on points per game across all matches over the two abandoned seasons (2019–20 and 2020–21), while teams were promoted to Step 6 on the basis of a subjective application process.[7]

Premier Division East[edit]
Football league seasonSouth West Peninsula League← 2019–20 2021–22 → 
Premier Division East features 20 teams, unchanged from the previous season.
Honiton Town and Torridgeside were required to install floodlights at their grounds to maintain their membership of the league. Torridgeside complied in October 2020.[8]

We All Love Ennio Morricone is a 2007 tribute album honoring noted film composer Ennio Morricone. It features a diverse lineup of artists including Andrea Bocelli, Metallica, Bruce Springsteen, Roger Waters, and Celine Dion.  Also, industry giant Quincy Jones, an admirer of Morricone's work as a composer for many years, enlisted his longtime songwriting collaborators Alan and Marilyn Bergman to write the lyrics to "I Knew I Loved You", which Dion sang to Morricone's "Deborah's Theme" from Once Upon a Time in America. Bruce Springsteen won the Grammy Award Best Rock Instrumental Performance for his version of "Once Upon A Time In The West", beating out Metallica who was nominated for their cover of "The Ecstasy of Gold", also from this album. The album sold over 120,000 copies in Italy alone[3]

The NeXT character set (often aliased as NeXTSTEP encoding vector, WE8NEXTSTEP[1] or next-multinational[2]) was used by the NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP operating systems on NeXT workstations beginning in 1988. It is based on Adobe Systems' PostScript (PS) character set aka Adobe Standard Encoding where unused code points were filled up with characters from ISO 8859-1 (Latin 1), although at differing code points.[3]


Character set[edit]
The following table shows the NeXT character set. Each character is shown with a potential Unicode equivalent. Codepoints 00hex (0) to 7Fhex (127) are nearly identical to ASCII.

Metopism is the condition of having a persistent metopic suture,[2] or persistence of the frontal metopic suture in the adult human skull.[3] Metopism  is the opposite of craniosynostosis.[4] The main  factor of the metopic suture is to increase the volume of the anterior cranial fossa. The frontal bone includes the forehead, and the  roofs of the orbits (bony sockets) of the eyes.
The frontal bone has vertical portion (squama) and horizontal portion (orbital part). Some adults have a metopic or frontal suture in the vertical portion.[5] In uterine period in right and left half of frontal region of the fetus there is a membrane tissue. On each half a primary ossification center appears about the end of the second month of the fetus. Primary ossification center extends  to form the corresponding half of the vertical part (squama) and horizontal part (orbital part) of the frontal bone.
At birth the frontal bone contains two portions, separated by the metopic (frontal) suture. Metopism is the condition of having a persistent metopic suture. Metopic suture is regularly obliterated, except at its lower part, by the eighth year, but infrequently persists throughout life.[6] There is no single proven cause of metopism. The occurrence  is from mild to serious situations. Visional,  learning, and behavioral problems may happen in serious metopism. Some don't need any medical treatment. Surgery is a successful approach for those who  need it. Treatment teams include:  neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons, neurologists, oral and  maxillofacial surgeons, audiologists, neuroscience nursing professionals, speech therapists, physical therapists, dentist, otolaryngologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.[7]

Anthrax is a genus of bombyliid flies, commonly known as "bee-flies" due to their resemblance to bees. Most are dull black flies, and are usually small to medium in size, 4–20 millimetres (0.2–0.8 in), and many species have striking wing patterns.[5]
Anthrax is a very large genus. While worldwide in distribution, most species are from the Palaearctic and Afrotropic regions. The genus includes species parasitic on tiger beetles – an unusual trait among the bee-flies. A. anthrax larvae parasitize bees.  Many North American species parasitize solitary wasps.[6][7]
The type species is Musca morio Linnaeus, 1758, later found to be a misidentification of Musca anthrax Schrank, 1781.[8]

Species[edit]
This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items.  (September 2008)
Anthrax flies often hover around people and land on them.[6]  This one, a member of A. oedipus or a similar species, landed repeatedly on the photographer's jeans.

Muttrupulliyaa is a Sri Lankan film about four individuals of Tamil descent living in Sri Lanka after the end of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009. This is the first film from Sri Lanka to describe this period
The story of Muttrupulliyaa  is told through a former female Tamil tiger rebel living in Jaffna with her three children and her husband missing after he surrendered to the Sri Lankan army,[1]  a historian living in the Vanni; an environmental activist from Colombo and a young journalist from Chennai who travels to Sri Lanka.
The production team had to shoot undercover in Sri Lanka, hiding their real identities because of the risks.. Despite these precautions, some of the film team were arrested or forced into hiding.
Muttrupulliyaa premiered at the Jaffna film festival.[2][3]

Censorship[edit]
Muttrupulliyaa  was allowed to be screened in Sri Lanka and was approved by the Public Performance Board of Sri Lanka.
Muttrupulliyaa  was banned in India by the censor board as it would damage Indo-Sri Lanka relations. The ban was later lifted by the  Film Certification Appellate Tribunal.  However, the filmmaker had to morph the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam flags, cut out photographs of its slain leaders and state that the film was a work of fiction inspired by real events.[4][5]

City of Leander, No. 18-51011CourtUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth CircuitDecidedJanuary 9, 2020DefendantCity of LeanderPlaintiff(s)Brett HorvathCitation(s)Not specifiedCase historySubsequent action(s)Not specifiedCourt membershipJudge(s) sittingNot specifiedCase opinionsThe Fifth Circuit upheld the decision of the district court, finding that an accommodation may be reasonable even if it is not the preferred accommodation of the person seeking an exemption.
Horvath v. City of Leander, No. 18-51011 (5th Cir. Jan. 9, 2020) is a legal case decided in 2020 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, holding that an employer may require employees to receive vaccinations, so long as the employer makes reasonable accommodations to religious objections, even if the accommodations offered are not ideal for the employee.[1][2]


Facts[edit]
Brett Horvath was a firefighter for the city of Leander, Texas, and a Baptist minister in his personal life. In previous years, he had claimed a religious exemption from the influenza vaccination. In 2016, however, when the city imposed a requirement that all firefighters receive the Tdap booster (for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis), Horvath was informed that he would not be able to obtain an exemption while continuing to work in his position without further conditions applying. He was given two alternatives, one being transfer to a "code enforcement officer" position with the same pay and benefits, but with a schedule inconvenient to his second job as a minister. The second was to remain as a firefighter but wear a respirator at all times on the job, submit to regular medical tests, and log his body temperature.[2] Horvath refused the transfer option and offered a different proposal of wearing a respirator only when in contact with certain types of potentially ill or vulnerable people. The city rejected Horvath's suggestion, and when he refused to accede to any of the options offered by the city, Horvath was terminated.[2]

Outcome[edit]
Horvath sued, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas upheld his termination on summary judgment.[3] On appeal the Fifth Circuit upheld the decision of district court.[2][3][4] The court found that an accommodation may be reasonable even though it is not the accommodation preferred by the person seeking an exemption.[2][5] Notably, "the validity of the employee's religious belief did not appear to be in dispute. The issue was whether the City offered a reasonable accommodation".[3] Furthermore, the Fifth Circuit, finding that the proposed transfer was reasonable despite the inconvenience to the plaintiff, noted that it did not need to examine the reasonableness of the second alternative.[2]
The opinion was issued in January 2020, shortly before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, it was cited by cases and articles addressing legal responses to vaccination mandates arising from the pandemic. A 2022 review noted that "perhaps presciently, Horvath was a case about mandatory vaccination requirements".[6]

Twin Lakes – Department of the Interior. General Land Office. U.S. Geological and Geographic Survey of the Territories. (1874 – June 30, 1879)
Lake County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado. As of the 2020 census, the population was 7,436.[1] The county seat and the only municipality in the county is Leadville.[2] The highest natural point in Colorado and the entire Rocky Mountains is the summit of Mount Elbert in Lake County at 14,440 feet (4,400 meters) elevation.


History[edit]
Lake County was one of the original 17 counties created by the Colorado legislature on November 1, 1861. As originally defined, Lake County included a large portion of western Colorado to the south and west of its present boundaries. The county was named for Twin Lakes.
Placer gold was found at Colorado Gulch in 1863 as part of the Colorado Gold Rush.[3]: 30 
Lake County slowly lost territory over the succeeding decades, losing land in its southeast to Saguache County in 1866 and Hinsdale County in 1874; in its southwest to La Plata County in 1874 and San Juan County in 1876, and in its west to Ouray and Gunnison counties in 1877.
With its many reductions in size, Lake County's designated county seat also changed multiple times within just a few years, residing successively in Oro City (from 1861), Lourette (from 1863), Dayton (from 1866), and Granite (from 1868).
By 1878, Lake County had been reduced to an area including only present-day Lake and Chaffee counties. On February 8, 1879, the Colorado legislature renamed Lake County as Carbonate County, although this designation name only lasted for two days, until Chaffee County was split off from Carbonate's southern section on February 10 and the remaining northern portion was redesignated Lake County with its current county seat of Leadville.

Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 384 square miles (990 km2), of which 377 square miles (980 km2) is land and 7.0 square miles (18 km2) (1.8%) is water.[4] It is the fourth-smallest county in Colorado by area.
As the courthouse with the highest elevation in the United States, the Lake County courthouse in Leadville is the "highest court" in the land.

Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lake_County,_Colorado&oldid=1220484034"Approximate Membership Query Filters (hereafter, AMQ filters) comprise a group of space-efficient probabilistic data structures that support approximate membership queries. An approximate membership query answers whether an element is in a set or not with a false positive rate of 



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }

.
Bloom filters are the most known AMQ filter, but there are other AMQ filters that support additional operations or have different space requirements.
AMQ filters have numerous applications, mainly in distributed systems and databases. There, they are often used to avoid network request or I/O operations that result from requesting elements that do not exist.


Approximate membership query problem[edit]
The approximate membership query problem is to store information about a set of elements S in a space-efficient way. The goal is to answer queries about whether an element x is in the set S or not, while constraining false positives to a maximal probability 



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }

. All AMQ filters support this lookup operation. Dynamic AMQ filters allow insertions at any time whereas static AMQ filters must be rebuilt after inserting additional elements. Some AMQ filters support additional operations such as deleting elements, or merging two filters.

Lookup[edit]
An AMQ filter lookup will determine whether an element is definitely not in the set or probably in the set.
In other words, if the filter represents a set S and we are interested in a value s, then the lookup function applied to s behaves as follows:

if 



s
∈
S


{\displaystyle s\in S}

: always returns true.
if 



s
∉
S


{\displaystyle s\notin S}

: returns false with probability 



1
−
ϵ


{\displaystyle 1-\epsilon }

.
A false positive is a lookup of an element that is not part of the set, but where the lookup returns true. The probability of this happening is the false positive rate 



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }

. False negatives (the lookup returns false although the element is part of the set) are not allowed for AMQ filters.

Insertion[edit]
After an element is inserted the lookup for this element must return true. Dynamic AMQ filters support inserting elements one at a time without rebuilding the data structure. Other AMQ filters have to be rebuilt after each insertion. Those are called static AMQ filters.

False positive rate vs. space[edit]
There is a tradeoff between storage size and the false positive rate 



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }

. Increasing the storage space reduces the false positive rate. The theoretical lower bound is 



l
o

g

2


(
1

/

)


{\displaystyle log_{2}(1/\epsilon )}

 bits for each element.[1] Dynamic AMQ filters cannot reach this lower bound. They need at least

 insertions.[2] Different AMQ filters have different ranges of false positive rates and space requirements. Choosing the best AMQ filter depends on the application.

Data structures[edit]
There are different ways to solve the approximate membership query problem. The most known data structure are Bloom filters, but there are other data structures that perform better for some false positive rates and space requirements, support additional operations, or have other insertion and lookup times. Below we describe some well known AMQ filters.

Bloom filter[edit]
A Bloom filter is a bit array of 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 bits with 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 hash functions. Each hash function maps an element to one of the 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 positions in the array. In the beginning, all bits of the array are set to zero. To insert an element, all hash functions are calculated and all corresponding bits in the array are set to one. To lookup an element, all 



k


{\displaystyle k}

 hash functions are calculated. If all corresponding bits are set, true is returned. To reduce the false positive rate, the number of hash functions and 



m


{\displaystyle m}

 can be increased.

Quotient filter[edit]
The idea of quotient filters is to hash an element and to split its fingerprint into the 



r


{\displaystyle r}

 least significant bits called the remainder 




d

R




{\displaystyle d_{R}}

 and the most significant bits called the quotient 




d

Q




{\displaystyle d_{Q}}

. The quotient determines where in the hash table the remainder is stored. Additional three bits for every slot in the hash table are used to resolve soft collisions (same quotient but different remainders).
The space used by quotient filters is comparable to Bloom filters, but quotient filters can be merged without affecting their false positive rate.

Cuckoo filter[edit]
Cuckoo filters are based on cuckoo hashing, but only fingerprints of the elements are stored in the hash table. Each element has two possible locations. The second location is calculated based on the first location and the fingerprint of the element. This is necessary to enable moving already inserted elements if both possible slots for an element are full.
After reaching a load threshold the insertion speed of cuckoo filter degrades. It is possible that an insertion fails, and the table must be rehashed. Whereas Bloom filters have always constant insertion time, but as the load factor increases the false positive rate increases as well.
A cuckoo filter supports deleting elements in the case where we know for certain that the element was in fact previously inserted. This is an advantage over Bloom filters and quotient filters which do not support this operation.

Xor filter[edit]
Xor filters[3] are static AMQ filters that are based on a Bloomier filter and use the idea of perfect hash tables. Similar to cuckoo filters, they save fingerprints of the elements in a hash table. The idea is that a query for an element 



x


{\displaystyle x}

 is true if the xor of three given hash functions 




h

0


,

h

1


,

h

2




{\displaystyle h_{0},h_{1},h_{2}}

 is the fingerprint of  



x


{\displaystyle x}

. While building the hash table, each element is assigned one of its three slots in a way that no other elements are assigned to this slot. After all elements are assigned, we set for each element the value of its slot to the xor of the two other (not assigned) slots of the element and the fingerprint of the element. This construction algorithm can fail in a way such that no dynamic insertions are possible without rebuilding the hash table. This hash table can be constructed using only 



1.23

log

2


⁡
(
1

/

ϵ
)


{\displaystyle 1.23\log _{2}(1/\epsilon )}

 bits per element.
The disadvantage of this filter is that the data structure has to be rebuilt if additional elements are added. They are used in applications where no elements have to added afterwards and space is of importance.

Application[edit]
Typical applications of AMQ filters are distributed systems and database systems. The AMQ filter functions as a proxy to the set of keys of a database or remote memory. Before a presumably slow query to the database or to remote memory is performed, the AMQ filter is used to give an approximate answer as to whether the key is in the database or in remote memory. The slow query is only performed when the AMQ filter returns true. Only in the case of a (hopefully rare) false positive is an unnecessary I/O or remote access performed. The applications are numerous and include package and resource routing, P2P networks, and distributed caching.[4]
AMQ filters are often used as an in-memory data structure to avoid expensive disk accesses. One application is Log-structured merge-trees or LSM trees. They have a fast in-memory component and one or multiple components on a disk which are trees themselves. Elements are inserted into the in-memory component until it reaches its maximal size, than the in-memory component is merged with the disk components. To speed up the lookup many LSM trees implement AMQ filters like Bloom filters or quotient filters. Those filters approximate for each component which elements are stored in it. LSM trees are used in databases like Apache AsterixDB, Bigtable, HBase, LevelDB, SQLite4.
Networks offer a lot of applications for AMQ filters. They are used to approximate a set of data that is located on a different servers. In many cases those AMQ filters can be seen as immutable. Even if the set on the remote server changes the AMQ filter is often not updated right away, but some false positives are tolerated. One example of this application is web cache sharing. If a proxy has a cache miss it wants to determine if another proxy has the requested data. Therefore, the proxy must know or at least approximate if another proxy holds the requested web page. This can be archived by periodically broadcasting a static AMQ filter of the URLs of the web pages a proxy has cached instead of broadcasting URL lists. In this setting, false negatives can occur if the cache changed in between periodic updates.
The same concept can be applied to P2P networks. AMQ filters can be used to approximate what is stored at each node of the network. The filter can be filled with ids or keywords of the actual documents of the nodes. False positives only lead to some unnecessary requests. AMQ filters have further applications in P2P networks for example finding the difference or intersection between sets stored on different nodes.

The 1983–84 Pittsburgh Penguins season was the club's 17th season of operation in the National Hockey League (NHL). The Penguins placed sixth in their division and did not qualify for the playoffs.


Offseason[edit]
Eddie Johnston, who had been the interim general manager, was awarded the GM title in June. He named Lou Angotti to take over the coaching duties.[1]
A controversy surrounding the end of the 1983–84 season was the apparent throwing of games by the Pittsburgh Penguins in order to secure Mario Lemieux as a draft pick. Angotti admitted the team deliberately tanked the season, though Johnston denied the claims.[2]

Trifurcula cryptella is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It is widespread throughout Europe, northwards to southern parts of Norway and Sweden (but not in Finland), eastwards to Poland and the Balkan Peninsula, and south to the Mediterranean countries, but there it is rare and confined to mountainous regions. In Italy it has only been recorded from the northern part, in Portugal in the Serra da Estrêla, in Spain in the Cantabrian Mountains and possibly the Sierra Nevada. It is absent from the Mediterranean islands.
The wingspan is 4-4.6 mm. The thick erect hairs on the head vertex are ferruginous-yellowish, sometimes mixed with fuscous. The collar is bright yellow. Antennal eyecaps are whitish. The forewings are pale greyish, coarsely irrorated with dark fuscous outer part of cilia whitish-grey. Hindwings grey.[1] External image
The larvae feed on Anthyllis montana, Coronilla coronata, Coronilla emerus, Coronilla emerus emeroides, Coronilla varia, Hippocrepis comosa, Lotus corniculatus, Lotus hispidus, Lotus pedunculatus and Lotus uliginosus. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a long corridor with a very broad, green frass line. This corridor suddenly widens into a broad blotch that in the end may occupy almost an entire leaflet. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.

Alfie James Chang (born 4 September 2002) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for EFL Championship club Birmingham City.

Early life and career[edit]
Chang attended Droitwich Spa High School.[4] He took up a two-year scholarship with Birmingham City's Academy in July 2019.[5] According to the then academy manager Kristjaan Speakman, Chang "is most effective as a deep midfield player. In this position he is able to dictate the tempo of the game and through calm and composed possession is able to demonstrate an excellent range of passing. In higher areas of the pitch he has the creativity and cleverness to construct play able to create opening for forward players."[5]
Playing in central midfield, he captained Birmingham's under-18s in their 2020–21 FA Youth Cup campaign,[6] and played for Birmingham's U23 team as they beat Sheffield United U23 in the national final of that season's Professional Development League.[7] Chang was one of five under-18s offered their first professional contract in 2021,[8] and one of four who accepted.[9]
Chang was given a squad number and named on the bench for Birmingham's EFL Cup first-round match at home to Colchester United of League One. He remained unused, but in the second round of the same competition, on 24 August, he replaced Dion Sanderson after 73 minutes to make his senior debut as Birmingham lost 2–0 at home to Fulham.[10] His next appearance was also his first senior start, in the first round of the 2022–23 EFL Cup away to Norwich City, which Birmingham lost on penalties. "A composed midfield performance" in that game[11] was followed four days later by his Football League debut. With Ryan Woods on the verge of leaving the club, Chang started alongside Jordan James in central midfield in Birmingham's visit to Cardiff City in the Championship; he played 75 minutes of the 1–0 defeat.[12][13]

Sashimi of etsu (Japanese name for Coilia nasus)
Coilia nasus,[1][2][3][4] also known as ungeo[5] and the Japanese grenadier anchovy or Chinese tapertail anchovy is a species of ray-finned fish from the family Engraulidae (anchovies). It grows to 41 cm (16 in) total length;[4][6] it is a relatively large species for its genus.[4] It is found in marine, freshwater, and brackish water at depths down to 50 m (160 ft). It is an example of an anadromous fish species, with some populations moving to freshwater to spawn.[4][6] Overall they are distributed in the northwest Pacific, between 21–42°N and 109–134°E,[6] or from Guangdong in China to the west coast of the Korean peninsula and the Ariake Sound in southwestern Japan.[4][5][6]  A traditional delicacy, the species is commercially fished in Korea, China and Japan. In China it is one of the most expensive fish sold, and as the anadromous variety is more expensive than the freshwater variety, the industry is mostly focussed in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and Yangtze.[7]

Seasonal migration and migratory dimorphism of coilia nanus.
Some Chinese populations migrate anadromously every spring up the Yangtze River before their final gonadal maturation in order to spawn in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze. After this the mature fish then migrate back to the sea. Other groups have been reported to be resident in freshwater lakes during their entire life cycle, making the species an interesting model of partial migration or migratory dimorphism.[8] To understand this process a 870Mb length reference genome has been assembled, and using this a population genetics study of representative freshwater and migratory individuals has probed deeper into the molecular mechanisms of migratory adaptation.[9]

The Dongjiang Dam is an arch dam on the Lishui River 14 km (9 mi) southwest of Zixing in Hunan Province, China. The dam was constructed between 1978 and 1992 and supports a 500 MW hydroelectric power station. The dam also provides for flood control, navigation and water supply. The dam's first generator was operational in 1987 and the reservoir, Dongjiang Lake, forced the relocation of 52 thousand people.[2]

Design[edit]
The Dongjiang is a 157 m (515 ft) tall and 438 m (1,437 ft) long variable-radius arch dam. The dam is 7 m (23 ft) wide at its crest, 35 m (115 ft) at its base and has a curve radius of 302.3 m (992 ft). Situated at the head of a 4,719 km2 (1,822 sq mi) catchment area, the dam withholds a reservoir of up to 9,565,000,000 m3 (7,754,472 acre⋅ft) of water. The dam's power station lies at its base and contains four 125 MW Francis turbine-generators. The height of the dam affords each generator an effective hydraulic head of 118.5 m (389 ft). The dam is also equipped with a boat/lumber lift.[2][3]

Sahmie combines Hopi traditional pottery making methods and Navajo iconography in her work. She has work in the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.

Biography[edit]
Sahmie is Navajo and was born in 1960 outside of Pine Springs, Arizona.[2] She married a Hopi man, Andrew "Louie" Sahmie, and moved to the Hopi reservation.[2] She learned pottery making from her mother in law, Priscilla Namingha.[2] Sahmie began to sell her pottery in the 1980s.[3]

Work[edit]
The shape of the pottery that Sahmie makes is based on Hopi traditions and incorporates traditional Navajo designs and iconography, such as Yei designs.[3] Sahmie prefers to use clay mined from the Navajo reservation and uses white and yellow clay in the body of the pots.[2] Black slip is created by adding wild spinach to the mixture.[2] Pots are fired outdoors using traditional methods.[2]
Sahmie has work in the Smithsonian American Art Museum,[1] and the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian.[2]

Marinekazerne Suffisant is a Dutch armed forces base located on Curaçao. Until 2009, it was used by the infantry company 31 INFCIE of the Netherlands Marine Corps. Currently the base is used for the conscription of Curaçaoan youths. However, rather than being purely military in nature, the conscription also serves a social purpose: conscripts can get an education and receive diplomas on the base.[2] During the first six months the conscripts receive military training and in the remaining six months they study to obtain a diploma.[3] The conscripts are called miliciens.[4] Currently the Royal Marechaussee has a brigade stationed on the base as well.[5]

History[edit]
The history of the Netherlands Marine Corps on Marinekazerne Suffisant began in 1929 after Venezuelan Rafael Simón Urbina together with a group of followers tried to take over Fort Amsterdam on Curaçao. The Netherlands sent the Marine Corps to provide external security for the Dutch ABC islands. Another reason was to provide resistance against internal riots, strikes and protests. During World War II local conscripts from the Dutch Caribbean were trained by Dutch marines. Many of these conscripts served from Marinekazerne Suffisant.[6] The base was at that time the largest on Curaçao. Local and Dutch forces worked together closely with forces from the United States for the defence of all Dutch Caribbean islands.[7]
On 16 June 2009, after a presence of 80 years on the island, the 31 INFCIE of the Netherlands Marine Corps on Curaçao was disbanded. Since that date only a small number of marines have remained, mainly to train the Curaçaoan conscripts.[8]
In March 2013, the Kingdom of the Netherlands Minister of Defence, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, and the Chief of Defence, Tom Middendorp, visited Marinekazerne Suffisant to inspect the miliciens.[4] The base had earlier received a royal visit when Queen Beatrix visited in November 2006.[9]
From June until September 2013, one of the suspects involved in the murder of politician Helmin Wiels was locked up in the Royal Marechaussee building on the base. The base was barricaded during the detention of the suspect.[5]

Brown dotted lines show the later (75 AD onwards) boundary of the smaller enclosure possibly used as a store and ironworks.[1]Numerous sites within the fortress have had archaeological excavations, but the timber post-holes and other remains have given little on the functions of particular sites. The selection of grey dots are just some of those sites showing Legionary buildings from both phases of its use.[2]1 Excavationas at Primary School site, with various buildings between two Roman streets, from early and late phases of the fortress.2 Excavations of the Via Principalis, the main east-west road across the fortress3 Excavated timber buildings of unknown functions.4 1st century beam-slot and posthole/pit at Kings' Head5 Excavation of timber structure and cobbled path or yard

Burrium was a legionary fortress in the Roman province of Britannia Superior or Roman Britain. Its remains today lie beneath the town of Usk in Monmouthshire, south east Wales.
The Romans founded the 48 acres (19 ha) fortress around AD 55, probably for the Legio XX Valeria Victrix (20th Legion) and perhaps an additional ala of 500 cavalrymen.[3] Earth and timber defences surrounded a number of legionary barracks. The fort was key to the conquest of the Silures, a tribe very resistant to the imposition of Roman rule in Roman Wales, but in AD 66, the legion was transferred to Viroconium Cornoviorum (at Wroxeter) and their base in Wales was largely abandoned. It was briefly replaced by a works depot for iron working. The surrounding vicus seems not to have developed into a small town, although it may have had an official mansio.

 Thazhekkad  is a village in Thrissur district in the state of Kerala, India.[1]


Demographics[edit]
As of 2001[update] India census, Thazhekkad had a population of 13387 with 6412 males and 6975 females.[1] Thazhekkad is covering a wide area comparing to its nearby villages.

Religion[edit]
Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are the prominent religions in this area. 60% of the population are Hindus, 35% Christians and remaining 5% Islamic believers.  St. Sebastian's church located in the village is a well known pilgrimage place for people  regardless of caste or religious beliefs and social backgrounds. The deity St.Sebastian at the church is called as "Muthappan" by the residents.  Followers of all religions lead harmonious and peaceful lives. Just opposite to St.Sebastian's Church, there is a temple of Lord Siva[2] called as Thazhekkad Maha Siva Kshethram and there have not been any communal disturbances till date. This is well recognized as the best example for the communal harmony existing in the village.

Economy[edit]
The economy of the village is based mainly on agriculture. Agricultural crops grown include paddy, coconut, arecanut, banana, spice crops like pepper, nutmeg, and fruit trees.
Thazhekkad has skilled youth who have gone to foreign lands, Middle East, Europe etc.; in search of better employment opportunities. The other significant source of income to the locality is remittances from NRIs.[3]

Transportation[edit]
Road is the main mode of transportation for Thazhekad residents. The nearest railway station is Irinjalakuda, situated at Kallettumkara.[4] The places/junctions connecting Thazhekkad to nearby towns and city include Kallettumkara, Kombinjamakkal, Thommana and Aloor and, these junctions and railway station are located at around 2-4 kilometers away from the village. Fast and easy to and fro commuting is an issue that the villagers face. Public transportation system, the most commonly used mode of transport by the public, is in its nascent stage over here. But gradually, many have overcome this issue to an extent by starting to use their own vehicles (bicycles, motor cycles and cars).

Geography[edit]
The landscape of this locale is attractive and naturally endowed. Evergreen paddy fields surrounded with water bodies like small canals and ponds with clear waters and aquatic richness add a perfect countryside picture to every body's heart. People from other parts of the district pay visits to Thazhekkad to enjoy holiday outings and there are a couple of interesting visitor's spots like Atbhutha Kulam (meaning 'wonder-pond'), fishing spots in paddy fields.

Stapleford Park is a Grade I listed country house[1] in Stapleford, near Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, England, which is now used as a hotel. It was originally the seat of the Sherard and Tamblyn families, later the Earls of Harborough and, from 1894, of the Gretton family, who would become the Barons Gretton.


House[edit]
The house has developed to its present form in stages. The north wing was originally built for Thomas Sherard c.1500 and remodelled in 1633 by William and Abigail Sherard. The main H-plan range was built for Bennet Sherard, 2nd Baron Sherard c.1670 and remodelled by the 4th Earl of Harborough c.1776. The orangery was added c.1820 and additional ranges were added by architect John Thomas Micklethwaite for brewer John Gretton in 1894–98.[1]
Stapleford Park had passed down in the Sherard and Tamblyn family since 1402. The 3rd Baron Sherard was made Earl of Harborough in 1719, the title expiring on the death of the 6th Earl in 1859. The estate was then bought in 1885 by James Hornsby and sold in 1894 to John Gretton, who carried out much alteration and new building. His son, John Gretton, MP, who succeeded him in 1899, subsequently became Baron Gretton.[1]
American fast-food restaurateur and hotelier Bob Payton bought the house from Lord Gretton in 1988 to convert it into a hotel. He restored the buildings, according to his obituary "hiring Wedgwood, Turnbull & Asser, Crabtree & Evelyn to decorate its rooms".[2]
St Mary Magdalene's Church in the park was built in 1783 by George Richardson for the 4th Earl Harborough.[3][4]


Lord Harborough's Curve[edit]
Stapleford Miniature Railway
The 6th Earl objected to a proposal in 1844 to run  the Syston and Peterborough Railway through Stapleford Park along the course of the River Eye. Its construction would threaten the struggling Oakham Canal, of which he was a shareholder. The dispute led to a series of brawls and confrontations between the Earl's men and canal employees on one side and the railway's surveyors on the other with up to 300 involved in each skirmish. The dispute has been called the "Battle of Saxby".[5]
Eventually the railway ran around Stapleford Park in what is known as "Lord Harborough's Curve". The tight bend was a nuisance for the express trains, and later when the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway built a connection to Bourne, the opportunity was taken to reduce the curve, with Saxby station being moved in the process. Lord Harborough had died in the meantime and the estate had been bought by Lord Gretton,  who was more sympathetic to the railway.
In 1958, the Stapleford Miniature Railway was constructed by the 2nd Lord Gretton in the parkland, as part of a public attraction which also included a lion reserve. The park and house became  a major tourist attraction through the 1960s and 70s. The park though closed in 1982 and the house was sold to become an exclusive country hotel. The railway and parkland, however, are still owned by the Gretton family, and open for charity a few times a year.

Filming[edit]
British Pathé made the short film "Stately Home Railway" here, in 1964. It featured the miniature steam locomotive 'Blanche of Lancaster' which is now at the Bickington Steam Railway, Trago Mills, Devon.
It was later used in the Mrs Thursday television series' episode, "The Train from Dunrich House"  broadcast on 10 January 1967.[citation needed]

Andrew Dorsett of PopMatters stated "These Systems Are Failing arrives at your ears with all the subtlety and sonic nuance of a brick wall. It would probably sound like this in any format based on the way it was produced, but when listened to as MP3s as most listeners doubtlessly will, its weaknesses are quite literally amplified... Only through brief glimpses is one able to perceive the dystopian present as Moby and company wish for us to see it. As a work of social activism the album is able to at least make a point, but as a work of art, it generally fails to cast the spell".[19]

The World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) is a network of people working on a global scale to eliminate obstacles to breastfeeding and to act on the Innocenti Declaration. The groups within this alliance tackle the problems from a variety of perspectives or point of views, such as consumer advocates, mothers, and lactation consultants.[2][3]
Among the various organizations and individuals involved in the creation of WABA, Derrick and Pat Jelliffe, two experts in tropical paediatrics and infant nutrition, were instrumental in its founding and in the launching of some of its more visible early initiatives.[4][5][6][7]
WABA organises the World Breastfeeding Week, held annually August 1 through the 7th, to put together the efforts of all breastfeeding advocates, governments, and the public in more than 170 countries.[8]


Campaigns[edit]
Several campaigns are associated with the WABA:
1991 to present - The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) is a joint campaign by UNICEF and the World Health Organization, and focuses mainly on hospital practices, implementing the principles of the Innocenti Declaration.[9]
1993 - This campaign tackled the problem of developing mother-friendly workplaces. In general, they wanted mothers to be able to combine breastfeeding with their working atmosphere.[citation needed]
1994 - The main focus of the '94 campaign was to implement again the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes in all countries to meet the demands of the Innocenti Declaration.[citation needed]

International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes[edit]
International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (Rules for industries, health workers, and governments to regulate the promotion of baby products through marketing):[10][11][12]

No advertising of any of these products to the public.
No free samples to mothers.
No promotion of products in health care facilities, including the distribution of free or low-cost supplies.
No company sales representatives to advise mothers.
No gifts or personal samples to health workers.
No words or pictures idealizing artificial feeding, or pictures of infants on labels of infant milk containers.
Information to health workers should be scientific and factual.
All information on artificial infant feeding, including that on labels, should explain the benefits of breastfeeding, and the costs and hazards associated with artificial feeding.
Unsuitable products, such as sweetened condensed milk, should not be promoted for babies.
Manufacturers and distributors should comply with the Code's provisions even if countries have not adopted laws or other measures.

Long Point State Park (on Chautauqua Lake) is a 360-acre (1.5 km2) state park[2] located in the Town of Ellery, near the hamlet of Maple Springs in Chautauqua County, New York. The park is located on a short peninsula on the east side of the lake and can be reached on Route 430.

The park was formed from two gifts of former estates on Chautauqua Lake. The first estate was donated to New York State in 1956 by Mr. and Mrs. John W. Minturn; Mrs. Minturn was the granddaughter of former state governor Reuben E. Fenton. The park was expanded several years later with the gift of the summer estate of Bainbridge Colby, former United States Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson.[3]

Facilities[edit]
The park offers a beach, a playground, picnic tables and pavilions, a nature trail, showers, fishing, a boat launch with marine pump-out station, and cross-country skiing and snowmobiling.[1]

The Balmville Tree was an old-growth eastern cottonwood growing at the intersection of River Road, Balmville Road and Commonwealth Avenue in Balmville, New York, a hamlet within the Town of Newburgh. It was the oldest tree of that species in the Eastern United States.[2]
It was thought at first to be a Balm-of-Gilead tree, and lent that name to the surrounding community. By the late 20th century its size had led to consideration of its removal as a potential traffic hazard. The community rallied around efforts to save it, which led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 along with a neighboring house. The state took ownership of the land, making it New York's smallest state forest. However, the tree kept suffering structural problems, and it was finally cut down in 2015.[3]


History[edit]
Local folklore has it that the tree grew when George Washington planted his walking stick while he and the Continental Army were encamped in nearby Newburgh during the final years of the Revolutionary War,[4] but core samples of the tree have dated its growth to 1699, well before American independence.[2] Andrew Jackson Downing, Frederic Delano, and Franklin Roosevelt were among the tree's admirers.[5]
In the mid 20th century, it began to suffer the effects of its advanced age and vandalism. In the mid-1970s arborists recommended it be removed as a traffic hazard. However, community groups led by Richard Severo, whose house overlooked the tree, were able to save it, citing its historic value.[2]
It has thus received considerable protection from the state and federal governments. An elaborate guy-wire system and adjacent metal pole help support it, and it and the small patch of land on which it grew are protected, both by the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation as a historic site and by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation as a "public historic park" or state forest,[6] making it New York's smallest at 348 square feet (31 m2) in area. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2000.[7]
On March 27, 2009, a group of environmentally minded members of the community gathered around the tree as cherry pickers cut its branches, and gardeners from the Garden Club of Orange and Dutchess Counties and other nature organizations took buds to bring home and nurse in pots until large enough to plant in the ground.  Any buds that flourish will[needs update] be distributed to historically significant sites throughout the Mid Hudson Valley. As the headline of the next edition of The Sentinel proclaimed, "Balmville Tree's Longevity Could be Passed on to Descendents".[8]
The only people to have successfully propagated a cutting from the Balmville Tree are Richard and Emoke Severo, who live next door to the tree.  Of the four attempts the Severos made, after taking cuttings in 1999, the tricentennial of the Balmville Tree, only one survived which they credit to the cutting sharing the same water and soil as the original tree.[8]
On August 5, 2015 the tree was cut down and removed by the New York State Department of Environmental Protection, which cited safety concerns. For several weeks prior to the removal, the surrounding roads were closed to traffic due to the rapid deterioration of the tree, including the danger of falling limbs. Residents did not protest, but nevertheless lamented the tree's end. "There is no Balmville without the Balmville Tree," one told a local newspaper.[3]
A 15-foot-tall (4.6 m) stump remains. It is still a protected area; residents are planning to rededicate it. Many also took cuttings and will plant them in the hope of carrying on the tree genetically.[9]

Measurements[edit]
At the time of its removal it was 25 feet (7.6 m) in circumference at its base, and 83 feet (25 m) high. It once reached as high as 110 feet (33. 5 m), but its crown had to be trimmed after extensive damage from Hurricane Floyd in 1999.[10]

"That's the Way" is a folk rock ballad by English rock band Led Zeppelin from their third album, Led Zeppelin III, released in 1970.  As with several of the tracks on the album, it is an acoustic song.


Composition[edit]
Jimmy Page and Robert Plant wrote the piece in 1970 on a retreat at Bron-Yr-Aur cottage, Wales.[2] Page noted that the two developed it and recorded a rough demo after a long walk before they returned to the cottage.[3]
The original working title of the song was "The Boy Next Door".[4] On the surface, the lyrics are about one boy's parents being against a friendship with another boy due to his long hair and coming from the wrong side of town.[5]  It also reflects on the group's early American tours, when they were sometimes harassed for their appearance.[2]
Instrumentation for the song is spare, consisting of a strummed twelve-string acoustic guitar, with overdubbed mandolin and steel guitar fills; percussion and bass are absent from much of the song until the instrumental outro.[4] According to Page, "And right at the end, where everything opens up, I played a dulcimer."[6][7] He also plays the bass heard at the conclusion: "I was doing a bunch of overdubs and got excited. [Bassist] John Paul Jones went home, so I put the bass part on it as well! [laughs] That didn't happen often, believe me!"[6][7]

Personnel[edit]
According to Jean-Michel Guesdon and Philippe Margotin (except for pedal steel):[1]

Robert Plant – vocals
Jimmy Page – acoustic guitars, pedal steel guitar, dulcimer, bass, vocal harmonies (?)
John Paul Jones – mandolin, vocal harmonies (?)
John Bonham – tambourine
Reception[edit]
In a contemporary review of Led Zeppelin III, Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone describes "That's the Way" as the first Led Zeppelin song that has ever truly moved him.[5] Bangs praises the understated, but  effective acoustic guitar and vocal approach.[5]  In a later review for AllMusic, Denise Sullivan calls it "one of Led Zeppelin's most beautiful ballads (in the true tradition of the folk ballad)".[4]

Operation Gunung Gede (Indonesian: Operasi Gunung Gede Pangrango) was an Indonesian marines and KKO-AL military operation to hunt down and repel the DI/TII Kartosuwiryo gang hiding in Gunung Gede Pangrango in 1957. After Operation Indra in the Indramayu, West Java area in March 1953, namely in an effort to help the local Unity to defeat the DI/TII gangs Kartosuwiryo from the sea. So for the second time the KKO-AL unit has taken part in the same security operation. The operation codenamed "Operasi Gunung gede ", this operation took place from March 19, 1957, to March 24, 1957. The operation was carried out based on verbal orders from the KSAL which was then followed by a telegram KSAL 18-13 -30 March 1957/079, namely to second 2 Platoons of KKO-AL Troops to the 8-TT Infantry Regiment III, in the context of Security Operations.[1]


Preparation[edit]
For assignments in this Security Operation, a KKO-AL Combat Organization has been prepared with a strength of 2 reinforced platoons (1 Company), with the Company Commander Captain KKO Boy Abidin Nrp.546/P. Meanwhile, the platoon composition is as follows: 1st Platoon under the leadership of Lt.KKO. Pratowo Soedibyo Nrp.698/P and Platoon II under the leadership of Lt.KKO Soegijo Nrp.755/P. and target areas have been determined
around Mount Gede Pangrango, West Java.

Tasks[edit]
In accordance with the Navy KKO Commander's Order No.079/SP/KKO/57, dated March 18, 1957, the duties of the Navy KKO Troops are as follows:

Assist the 8-TT.III Infantry Regiment Unit in its efforts to destroy the power of the DI/TII gang Kartosuwiryo.
Carry out clean-up operations against gang units that are separated from their parent.
Implementation[edit]
The Gunung Gede operation was carried out based on the Regimental Operations Order dated 19 March 1957, in just a few days, namely from 19 March 1957 to 24 March 1957. In short, the implementation of this operation was because the Mission (Task) assigned to the KKO-AL Troops had been can be achieved where gang activities around Mount Pangrango can be suppressed and neutralized. On March 19, 1957, KKO-AL troops arrived in Sukabumi and then immediately reported to the Commander of the 8.TT.III Infantry Regiment and to the 311th Army Battalion which at that time was carrying out operational duties. After reporting themselves, the KKOAL troops continued their movement to Cipanas and to Cibodas, in Cibodas this was the new Lt.KKO. Prawoto Soedibjo as Danton I explained to the members the purpose
than his arrival in the area. March 20, 1957 KKO-AL Troops together with a CI Bn. 311 began moving to the high areas around Cibodas with the intention of looking for gang nests according to information obtained from local officers, but apparently during this movement no gangs were found at all, only former gang huts were found.
only, which had just been abandoned by the mob, then the troops rested (overnight) on the slopes of Mount Pangrango and Mount Gede. The next day, March 21, 1957, the troops continued their movement to the top of Mount Pangrango, the journey continued to approach with closed terrain and the air was constantly foggy with very cold air. Then the gang ran away, leaving behind several victims. During the battle, important documents were seized which were then handed over to the 8th Infantry Regiment in Sukabumi.
The success of this attack was due to a sudden ambush carried out by the KKO-AL Unit where the gang had no idea that an attack would occur. This was proven when the KKOAL troops approached the gang's nest to a distance of 15 meters, and this was the opportunity for an intensive attack, so that in such a situation, the mob panicked and was devastated and left behind victims and others who were not able to run away. Furthermore, KKO-AL troops continued to pursue the remains
The hordes fled to Pasir Datar and finally the troops were able to reach Ciheuleng Waterfall. And it was here on March 23, 1957, that a second battle occurred with the DI/TII Kartosuwiryo gang, the battle lasted approximately 10 minutes. With a quick and sure movement the mob was finally repulsed. The horde retreated to the north where there were many mountains and wild forests. With the completion of the battle at Curug Ciheuleng, the troops moved south to Pasir Datar and it turned out that during this last movement there was no armed contact. In accordance with the order issued by the 8.TT III Siliwangi Infantry Regiment, the movement of the Navy KKO Troops ended here at 20.00
evening the troops returned to Sukabumi. From Sukabumi that same night at 22.00 the troops continued to return to Jakarta carried by 7 TNI AD trucks. And finally arrived in Jakarta safely at 03.00 in the morning (24 March 1957).

Aftermath[edit]
KKO-AL succeeded in killing several members of the DI/TII gang and confiscating documents during two battles.
KKO-AL has gained new experience in carrying out operations in inland and mountainous areas with densely forested terrain and quite cold weather. The weather in this operational area is always filled with thick fog and this means that the troops have to be careful in carrying out their movements apart from losing sight of the front and surroundings, also because the road taken by the troops has to climb and descend, the road itself has never been crossed by humans. However, the KKO-AL troops who carried out the operation were still able to carry out their duties and obligations both day and night and did not know the hard work and difficulty of the journey they had to make during the movement from Cibodas to Pasir Datar, so that the enemy (the gang) did not suspect anything at all. that KKO-AL troops would arrive at their place and attack their defenses. This proves that KKO-AL troops are not only capable of carrying out landing operations in coastal areas, but even in security operations in inland and mountainous areas with bad forest and weather conditions, KKO-AL is capable and able to do it well.
